products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a highquality sales and aftersales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers To ensure a highquality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized the Company continues to build and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide The Companys retail stores are typically located at hightraffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable hightraffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a high quality customer buying experience and attract new customers The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice service and training and offer a wide selection of thirdparty hardware software and other accessories that complement the Companys products The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing highquality Apple fixtures merchandising materials and other resources within selected thirdparty reseller locations Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program certain thirdparty resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise

reselling services for iPhone iPad and Mac No single customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales in 2014 2013 or 2012 Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 5 Table of Contents Competition The markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices The Companys competitors who sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price product features relative priceperformance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices These markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses The Companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware iPhone iPad Mac and iPod software iOS OS X and iTunes online services and distribution of digital content and applications iTunes Store App Store iBooks Store and Mac App Store Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources In addition the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers Therefore many components used by the Company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 6 Table of Contents While the Company manufactures some Macs in the United States substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations Certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through RD licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology Total RD expense was 60 billion 45 billion and 34 billion in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively Patents Trademarks Copyrights and Licenses The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the US and a number of foreign countries Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world Over time the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products processes and services While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the Companys products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others From time to time the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data During 2014 the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 38 and 62 respectively of total net sales Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II Item 7 of this Form 10K under the subheading Segment Operating Performance and in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11 Segment Information and Geographic Data While substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia the Company also performs final assembly of certain products at its manufacturing facility in Ireland The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the US Asia and Europe Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 7 Table of Contents Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction However neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance Warranty The Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser The Company also offers a 90day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products In certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute typically at least two years In addition where available consumers may purchase APP or AC which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products Backlog In the Companys experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects In particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply Because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance Employees As of September 27 2014 the Company had approximately 92600 fulltime equivalent employees and an additional 4400 fulltime equivalent temporary employees and contractors Approximately 46200 of the total fulltime equivalent employees worked in the Companys Retail segment Available Information The Companys Annual

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10K The business financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause the Companys actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition Any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the Companys business financial condition results of operations and stock price Because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the Companys financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company The Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values andor other factors These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Companys products and services Demand also could differ materially from the Companys expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the US to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the US dollar Other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Companys products and services In the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets This could have a number of effects on the Companys business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development andor manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Companys products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the Companys ability to issue new debt Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments interest rates cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the Companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 9 Table of Contents Global markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets The Companys products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers The Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services As a result the Company must make significant investments in RD The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks In contrast many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Companys intellectual property the Companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected The Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related thirdparty digital content and applications The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the Company has a minority market share in the smartphone market Additionally the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Companys product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications and with business models that include content provided to users for free Some of the Companys competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the Company Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources andor experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions The Companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Companys ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X which has a minority market share in the personal computer market This market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably Windows In the market for personal computers and accessories the Company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base Historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windowsbased personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins An increasing number of Internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Companys existing products The Companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 10 Table of Contents To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes the Company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction Accordingly the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions The Company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and valueadded resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers The Company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsized businesses through its online and retail stores Carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone typically subsidize users purchases of the device There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers Many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Companys products Such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue The financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the Companys products or uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk The Company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components The Company also reviews its longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable If the Company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments Consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand Where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier Purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days Because the Companys markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 11 Table of Contents Future operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities Because the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks Many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the Companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components The followon effects from global economic conditions on the Companys suppliers described in Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company above also could affect the Companys ability to obtain components Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases The Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries The Companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of whom are located outside of the US Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management While these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the Companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur The Company relies on solesourced outsourcing partners in the US Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia for final assembly of substantially all of the Companys hardware products Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Companys cost or supply of components or finished goods In addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted The Companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Companys reputation The Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects Sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the Company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation The Companys online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells Failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Companys reputation Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 12 Table of Contents The Company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content through the iTunes Store This includes the right to make available music movies TV shows and books currently available through the iTunes Store The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all Some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future Other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the Companys access to or increase the cost of such content The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach Failure to obtain the right to make available thirdparty digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Some thirdparty digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions If requirements change the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner In addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Companys content providers The Companys future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services There is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Companys products If thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Companys products customers may choose not to buy the Companys products With respect to its Mac products the Company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the Companys products compared to Windowsbased products This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services If the Companys minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Macs prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Companys Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market With respect to iOS devices the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the App Store iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers As with applications for the Companys Mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the Companys iOS devices rather than its competitors platforms such as Android If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the Companys iOS devices may suffer The Company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all Many of the Companys products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties Based on past experience and industry practice the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms There is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all Failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 13 Table of Contents The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future For example technology companies including many of the Companys competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights In addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained As the Company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase In particular the Companys cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the Company has significantly increased The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of US jurisdictions and before the US International Trade Commission as well as internationally in various countries The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop noninfringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a thirdparty or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products In certain cases the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur These licenses may also significantly increase the Companys operating expenses Regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the Companys operations and distracting to management In recognition of these considerations the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation In managements opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights However the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain Although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the Companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Companys business The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas These US and foreign laws and regulations affect the Companys activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 14 Table of Contents By way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change Such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carriers network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks These certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the Company from selling certain products Compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business Any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the Companys products and services less attractive to the Companys customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the Companys employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Companys policies and procedures The Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations Compliance with applicable US and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the Companys employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses The Companys Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties The Companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities Because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores Due to the high cost structure associated with the Retail segment a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs Many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the Companys control pose risks and uncertainties These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the Companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the Companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the US costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the Companys inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 15 Table of Contents Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Companys ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated The Company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful The Companys business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions The Company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions These may be caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the Companys disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the Companys online stores and services preclude retail store transactions compromise Company or customer data and result in delayed or cancelled orders System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products delivery of online services transactions processing and financial reporting There may be breaches of the Companys information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services or subject the Company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences The Companys business requires it to use and store customer employee and business partner personally identifiable information PII This may include among other information names addresses phone numbers email addresses contact preferences tax identification numbers and payment account information Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect many companies across various industries the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII it manages The Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems The Company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or accounts As with all companies these security measures are subject to thirdparty security breaches employee error malfeasance faulty password management or other irregularities For example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the Companys information technology systems To help protect customers and the Company the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders The Company devotes significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data but these security measures cannot provide absolute security To the extent the Company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services Moreover if a computer security breach affects the Companys systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII the Companys reputation and brand could be materially damaged use of the Companys products and services could decrease and the Company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability While the Company maintains insurance coverage that subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant selfinsured retention is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 16 Table of Contents The Companys business is subject to a variety of US and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection The Company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of PII In many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries and among the Company its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices Noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability The Companys privacy policy which includes related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data is posted on its website Any failure by the Company its suppliers or other parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others The Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors Under these rules and obligations if information is compromised the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties In addition if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs The Companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel Much of the Companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its Chief Executive Officer executive team and other highly skilled employees Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in Silicon Valley where most of the Companys key personnel are located The Companys business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions War terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners The Companys business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control Such events could decrease demand for the Companys products make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply chain Should major public health issues including pandemics arise the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers The majority of the Companys RD activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters In the event of a natural disaster the Company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 17 Table of Contents The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate The Companys profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels The Companys software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Companys other products Gross margins on the Companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations The Companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners In addition the Companys gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening US dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses The Company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the Companys products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the Companys logistics components supply or manufacturing partners The Companys stock price is subject to volatility The Companys stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future Additionally the Company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time The Company believes its stock price reflects expectations of future growth and profitability The Company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Companys Board of Directors and the Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares If the Company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention The Companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the US dollar versus local currencies The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonUS dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar adversely affects the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the Companys products Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations In some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings Conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar while generally beneficial to the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit Additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins The Company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 18 Table of Contents The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio Given the global nature of its business the Company has both domestic and international investments Credit ratings and pricing of the Companys investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors As a result the value and liquidity of the Companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially Therefore although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen The Company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and valueadded resellers The Company also sells its products directly to small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty financing arrangements or credit insurance The Companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited The Company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company In addition the Company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components As of September 27 2014 a significant portion of the Companys trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities The Company is subject to taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions including Ireland where a number of the Companys subsidiaries are organized Due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change The Companys future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the US and Ireland For example in June 2014 the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Ireland with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Companys Irish subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid If the European Commission were to take a final decision against Ireland it could require changes to existing tax rulings that in turn could increase the Companys taxes in the future The European Commission could also require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes reflective of the disallowed state aid The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations If the Companys effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the US or Ireland or if the ultimate determination of the Companys taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the Companys operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 19 Table of Contents Item 2 Properties The Companys headquarters are located in Cupertino California As of September 27 2014 the Company owned or leased 197 million square feet of building space primarily in the US The Company also owned or leased building space in various locations including throughout Europe China Singapore and Japan Of the total owned or leased building

second corporate campus The Company also owned data centers in Newark California Maiden North Carolina Prineville Oregon and Reno Nevada Outside the US the Company owned additional facilities for various purposes The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment which are used by all operating segments are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors and continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products Item 3 Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business In the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies However the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty Therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected See the risk factor The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in Part I Item 1A of this Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors The Company settled

2014 was driven by multiple factors including lower commodity costs a favorable shift in mix to products with higher margins and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales which was partially offset by the weakness in several foreign currencies relative to the US dollar price reductions on select products and higher cost structures on certain new products The yearoveryear decrease in gross margin in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by multiple factors including introduction of new versions of existing products with higher cost structures and flat or reduced pricing a shift in sales mix to products with lower margins introduction of iPad mini with gross margin significantly below the Companys average product margins higher expenses associated with changes to certain of the Companys service policies and other warranty costs price reductions on certain products including iPad 2 and iPhone 4 and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuations Apple Inc

percentage in the first quarter of 2015 is forwardlooking and could differ from actual results The Companys future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth above in Part I Item 1A of this Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors and those described in this paragraph In general the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the US dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins In response to competitive pressures the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins Gross margins could also be affected by the Companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products Due to the Companys significant international operations financial results can be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2014 2013 and 2012 are as follows dollars in

primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses including sharebased compensation costs and machinery and equipment to support expanded RD activities The Company continues to believe that focused investments in RD are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Companys core business strategy As such the Company expects to make further investments in RD to remain competitive Selling General and Administrative SGA Expense The growth in SGA expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses including sharebased compensation costs higher spending on marketing advertising and professional services and the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment The growth in SGA during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment and increased headcount

980 15 1156 121 522 The decrease in other income and expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to higher interest expense on debt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements partially offset by lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts and higher interest income The yearoveryear increase in other income and expense during 2013 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income resulting from the Companys higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts partially offset by interest expense on debt issued in the third quarter of 2013 and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements The weightedaverage interest rate earned by the Company on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 111 103 and 103 during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively The Company had no debt outstanding during 2012 and accordingly did not incur any related

13118 14030 Effective tax rate 261 262 252 The Companys effective tax rates for all years differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland for which no US taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the US As of September 27 2014 the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 51 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 203 billion Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance During the fiscal year ended September 27 2014 the US Internal Revenue Service IRS concluded its review of the years 2004 through 2009 The IRS is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012 In addition the Company is subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations However the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014 the

manufacture subassemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company which typically covers periods up to 150 days The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers Consistent with industry practice the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information Where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier Other Obligations The Companys other obligations were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and commitments related to advertising RD Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations The Companys other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties As of September 27 2014 the Company had noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of 203 billion Additionally as of September 27 2014 the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of 40 billion and an additional 630 million for gross interest and penalties classified as noncurrent liabilities At this time the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table Indemnification The Company generally does not indemnify endusers of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes thirdparty intellectual property rights Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs andor damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified thirdparty However the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified thirdparty In the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of endusers of its operating system or application software for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of September 27 2014 or September 28 2013 The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers Under these agreements the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim However the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 38 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Companys management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications accessories and service and support contracts The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred For most of the Companys product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped For online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the US and for certain other sales the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware For multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software andor undelivered nonsoftware services the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices In such circumstances the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value VSOE ii thirdparty evidence of selling price TPE and iii best estimate of selling price ESP VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable ESPs reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis For sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices Mac and Apple TV the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers The Company also provides various nonsoftware services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the nonsoftware services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Companys ESPs Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services based on the Companys ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided for each of these devices which ranges from two to four years Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 39 Table of Contents The Companys process for determining ESPs involves managements judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable Should future facts and circumstances change the Companys ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and nonsoftware services related to future sales of these devices could change Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide nonsoftware services and the estimated period software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs For transactions involving price protection the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met The Companys policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses For the Companys other customer incentive programs the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue Additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive Managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities The Companys investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets Changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities impact the Companys net income only when such securities are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is otherthantemporarily impaired which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made In making this judgment the Company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the Companys intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis The Companys assessment on whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security Inventory Valuation and Valuation of ManufacturingRelated Assets and Estimated Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process equipment including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities In addition the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components The Company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value The Company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends The Company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 40 Table of Contents The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory inventory prepayments andor manufacturingrelated capital assets These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Companys products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Companys product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Companys suppliers that hold any of the Companys manufacturing process equipment or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment Such writedowns would adversely affect the Companys results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded The Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled Consistent with industry practice the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand Where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier Purchase commitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products if the Companys product development plans change or if there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products then the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded Warranty Costs The Company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience Each quarter the Company reevaluates these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Companys results of operations Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made In addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 41 Table of Contents Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I Item 3 of this Form 10K under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated In the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies However the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty Therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures Given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates Further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results Interest Rate Risk While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries the Companys interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in US interest rates Changes in US interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Companys debt Investments The Companys investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Companys liquidity requirements The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives The Companys exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio The Company typically invests in highlyrated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve Based on investment positions as of September 27 2014 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 34 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio As of September 28 2013 a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a 27 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 42 Table of Contents Debt In April 2014 the Board of Directors authorized the Company to issue Commercial Paper pursuant to a commercial paper program As of September 27 2014 the Company had 63 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding with maturities generally less than nine months In the third quarters of 2014 and 2013 the Company issued 120 billion and 170 billion of longterm debt respectively The debt issuances included floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of 290 billion collectively the Notes The Company has entered and may enter in the future into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments In the third quarter of 2014 the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 90 billion which effectively converted most of the fixedrate notes into floatingrate notes and in the third quarter of 2013 the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 30 billion which effectively converted the floatingrate notes into fixedrate notes As of September 27 2014 a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Companys debt to increase by 110 million on an annualized basis Further details regarding the Companys debt is provided in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6 Debt Foreign Currency Risk In general the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the US dollar Accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the US dollar will negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in US dollars There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries The Companys practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to 12 months However the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Companys foreign currency derivative positions the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk VAR model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the Companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool The model assumes normal market conditions Forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model Based on the results of the model the Company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 240 million as of September 27 2014 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 201 million as of September 28 2013 Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures Actual future gains and losses associated with the Companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 27 2014 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the Companys actual exposures and positions Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 43 Table of Contents Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Page Consolidated Statements of Operations for the

Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications accessories and service and support contracts The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred For most of the Companys product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped For online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the US and for certain other sales the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 50 Table of Contents For the sale of most thirdparty products the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products retains related inventory risk for physical products is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers For thirdparty applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer Therefore the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to thirdparty app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services that are attached to hardware and software products The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores and also sells gift cards redeemable on the iTunes Store for the purchase of digital content and software The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support repair services webbased support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Companys standard limited warranty The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs For transactions involving price protection the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded For the Companys other customer incentive programs the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables For multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software and undelivered nonsoftware services the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices In such circumstances the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value VSOE ii thirdparty evidence of selling price TPE and iii best estimate of selling price ESP VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable ESPs reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis For multielement arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone iPad and iPod touch iOS devices Mac and Apple TV the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers Essential software for iOS devices includes iOS and related applications and for Mac includes OS X and related applications The Company also provides various nonsoftware services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale The second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iOS devices Mac and Apple TV to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software The third deliverable is the nonsoftware services to be provided to qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables the allocation of revenue is based on the Companys ESPs Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 51 Table of Contents software upgrade rights and the nonsoftware services is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided for each of these devices which ranges from two to four years Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software including estimated warranty costs are recognized at the time of sale Costs incurred to provide nonsoftware services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred The Companys process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable The Company believes its customers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its qualifying hardware products This view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the Company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered The Company also believes its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the nonsoftware services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users Therefore the Company has concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the nonsoftware services on a standalone basis including those rights and services attached to iOS devices Mac and Apple TV the selling prices would be relatively low Key factors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the Company for similar offerings market trends in the pricing of Applebranded and thirdparty Mac and iOS compatible software the nature of the upgrade rights eg unspecified versus specified and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product The Company may also consider additional factors as appropriate including the impact of other products and services provided to customers the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist productspecific business objectives and the length of time a particular version of a device has been available When relevant the same factors are considered by the Company in developing ESPs for offerings such as the nonsoftware services with additional consideration given to the estimated cost to provide such services In 2014 2013 and 2012 the Companys combined ESPs for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the rights to receive the nonsoftware services included with its qualifying hardware devices have ranged from 5 to 40 As of September 27 2014 the combined ESPs for Mac was 40 and for iPhone and iPad ranged from 15 to 25 Revenue allocated to such rights is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the rights are expected to be provided for each device which ranges from two to four years Shipping Costs For all periods presented amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue and the Companys shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales Warranty Costs The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized The Company assesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates Software Development Costs Research and development RD costs are expensed as incurred Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers In most instances the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established Costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility were not significant and software development costs were expensed as incurred during 2014 2013 and 2012 Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling general and administrative expenses Advertising expense was 12 billion 11 billion and 10 billion for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 52 Table of Contents Sharebased Compensation The Company recognizes expense related to sharebased payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the Company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments Sharebased compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted stock units RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant The Company recognizes sharebased compensation cost over the awards requisite service period on a straightline basis for timebased RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on the achievement of performance metrics The Company recognizes a benefit from sharebased compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized In addition the Company recognizes the indirect effects of sharebased compensation on RD tax credits foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations Further information regarding sharebased compensation can be found in Note 9 Benefit Plans of this Form 10K Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement See Note 5 Income Taxes of this Form 10K for additional information Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options shares to be purchased under the Companys employee stock purchase plan unvested restricted stock and unvested RSUs The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method Under the treasury stock method an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities The following table shows the

investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents The Companys marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as availableforsale Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance sheet date The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either shortterm or longterm based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as shortterm and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as longterm The Company classifies its marketable equity securities including mutual funds as either shortterm or longterm based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations The Companys marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of shareholders equity The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method Derivative Financial Instruments The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders equity and reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument if any is recognized in current income To receive hedge accounting treatment cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions For options designated as cash flow hedges changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in income For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period For derivative instruments designated as a hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure of the net investment in a foreign operation the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness Accordingly any gains or losses related to this component are recognized in current income Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current income Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors The Company considers historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality of the Companys customers current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost computed using the firstin firstout method or market If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value Property Plant and Equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at cost Depreciation is computed by use of the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building between two to five years for machinery and equipment including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internaluse software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage Capitalized costs related to internaluse software are amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from three to five years Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was 69 billion 58 billion and 26 billion during 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 54 Table of Contents LongLived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets The Company reviews property plant and equipment inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles excluding goodwill for impairment Longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate If property plant and equipment inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value The Company did not record any significant impairments during 2014 2013 and 2012 The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired The Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2014 2013 and 2012 The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit In 2014 and 2013 the Companys goodwill was allocated to the Americas and Europe reportable operating segments The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment The Company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years Fair Value Measurements The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the marketbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities Level 3 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability The Companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Companys debt instruments and all other financial instruments all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 55 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its nonUS dollar functional currency subsidiaries into US dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in AOCI in shareholders equity The Companys subsidiaries that use the US dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each

securities generally range from one to five years As of September 27 2014 and September 28 2013 gross unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not significant As of September 27 2014 the Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and does not consider any of its investments otherthantemporarily impaired The Company typically invests in highlyrated securities and its investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio When evaluating an investment for otherthantemporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto changes in market interest rates and the Companys intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investments cost basis During 2014 2013 and 2012 the Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 57 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk The Company may enter into forward contracts option contracts swaps or other derivative instruments to offset some of the risk on expected future cash flows on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities However the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates certain of the Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the US dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue The Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the US dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies The Company may enter into interest rate swaps options or other instruments to manage interest rate risk These instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense or changes in fair value of the Companys longterm debt or investments The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value The Companys accounting treatment for these instruments is based on the hedge designation The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and expense Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized as a component of other incomeexpense net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized The Companys foreign currency and interest rate transactions hedged with cash flow hedges as of September 27 2014 are expected to occur within 12 months and four years respectively Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be dedesignated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent twomonth time period Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense unless they are redesignated as hedges of other transactions The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during 2014 2013 and 2012 The gainloss recognized in other income and expense for foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was not significant during 2014 2013 and 2012 These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts Apple Inc 2014 Form 10K 58 Table of Contents The following table shows the notional amounts of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts associated with

38510 222 16131 25 The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss The credit risk amounts represent the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract based on thencurrent currency or interest rates at each respective date The Companys gross exposure on these transactions may be further mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Companys derivative instruments it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty To further limit credit risk the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets As of September 27 2014 the Company received 21 billion of cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements which were recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet As of September 28 2013 the Company posted cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements of 164 million which were recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet The Company did not have any derivative instruments with creditrisk related contingent features that would require it to post additional collateral as of September 27 2014 or September 28 2013 Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Companys derivative contracts the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other As of September 27 2014 and September 28 2013 the potential effects of these rights of setoff associated with the Companys derivative contracts including the effects of collateral would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of 16 billion and 333 million respectively

application software against legal claims that the software infringes thirdparty intellectual property rights Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs andor damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified thirdparty However the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified thirdparty In the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of endusers of its operating system or application software for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of September 27 2014 or September 28 2013 The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers Under these agreements the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim However the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material Apple

from multiple sources a number of components are currently obtained from single or limited sources In addition the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers Therefore many components used by the Company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations Certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days Other OffBalance Sheet Commitments Operating Leases The Company leases various equipment and facilities including retail space under noncancelable operating lease arrangements The Company does not currently utilize any other offbalance sheet financing arrangements The major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years the majority of which are for 10 years and often contain multiyear renewal options As of September 27 2014 the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were 50 billion of which 36 billion related to leases for retail space Rent expense under all operating leases including both cancelable and noncancelable leases was 717 million 645 million and 488 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases

of Contents Other Commitments The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company which typically covers periods up to 150 days The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers Consistent with industry practice the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information Where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier As of September 27 2014 the Company had outstanding offbalance sheet thirdparty manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of 245 billion In addition to the offbalance sheet commitments mentioned above the Company had outstanding obligations of 34 billion as of September 27 2014 which consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and commitments related to advertising RD Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated In the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies However the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain Therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Apple Inc v Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al On August 24 2012 a jury returned a verdict
