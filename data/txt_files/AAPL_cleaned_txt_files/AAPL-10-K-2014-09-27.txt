aggressive competition in all areas of its business These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidtechnological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices The Companys competitors who sell mobile devices and personalcomputers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and otherindustrywide downward pressures on gross margins Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price product features relative priceperformance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty softwareand accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation  The Company is focused on expandingits market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices These markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants The Company expects competition in thesemarkets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are morecompetitive than those they currently offer These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements bycompetitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses  The Companys digital content services have faced significantcompetition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovativeproducts and services in each of the markets in which it competes The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware iPhone iPad Mac and iPod software iOS OS X and iTunes onlineservices and distribution of digital content and applications iTunes Store App Store iBooks Store and Mac App Store Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such productsand services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings  Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currentlyobtained from single or limited sources In addition the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers Therefore many components used by theCompany including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operatingresults  The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the Company oftenutilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased If theCompanys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys financial condition and operating results could bematerially adversely affected The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtainsufficient quantities from an alternative source Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized tomeet the Companys requirements  The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guaranteethat the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financialcondition and operating results   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  6Table of ContentsWhile the Company manufactures some Macs in the United States substantially all of the Companyshardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locationsCertain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules theCompanys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 daysResearch and Development  Because the industries in which theCompany competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to themarketplace The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through RD licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses andtechnology Total RD expense was 60 billion 45 billion and 34 billion in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively  Patents Trademarks Copyrights andLicenses  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories softwareand services The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the US and a number of foreign countries Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is animportant factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuingthousands of patent applications around the world Over time the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services Nosingle patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties It may be necessary in the future to seekor renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products processes and services While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could beobtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certaincomponents of the Companys products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others From time to time the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents orother intellectual property rights of third parties  Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data During 2014 the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 38 and 62 respectively of total netsales Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II Item 7 of this Form 10K under the subheading Segment Operating Performance and in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11 Segment Information and Geographic Data While substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asiathe Company also performs final assembly of certain products at its manufacturing facility in Ireland The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the US Asia and Europe Margins onsales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international traderegulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10Kin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  7Table of ContentsBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonalholiday demand Additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as thesechannels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches Net sales can also be affected when consumers anddistributors anticipate a product introduction However neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductionsfuture net sales or financial performance  Warranty  TheCompany offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser The Company also offers a90day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products In certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribedby statute typically at least two years In addition where available consumers may purchase APP or AC which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products Backlog  In the Companys experience the actual amount ofproduct backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects In particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages Backlog is oftenreduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply Because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance Employees  As of September 27 2014 the Company hadapproximately 92600 fulltime equivalent employees and an additional 4400 fulltime equivalent temporary employees and contractors Approximately 46200 of the total fulltime equivalent employees worked in the Companys Retail segment Available

currently assigned to them   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  9Table of ContentsGlobal markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and subjectto rapid technological change and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets  The Companys products andservices compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standardscontinual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers The Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative newproducts and technologies to the marketplace The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and relatedservices As a result the Company must make significant investments in RD The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and servicemarks In contrast many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual propertyIf the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Companys intellectual property the Companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could beadversely affected  The Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also marketsrelated thirdparty digital content and applications The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware softwareand digital content supplier relationships and the Company has a minority market share in the smartphone market Additionally the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate theCompanys product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer The Company also competes with illegitimate waysto obtain thirdparty digital content and applications and with business models that include content provided to users for free Some of the Companys competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than theCompany Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources andor experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss The Company also expectscompetition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions The Companys financial conditionand operating results depend substantially on the Companys ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X which has a minority market share in the personal computer market This market has beencontracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably Windows In the market for personal computers and accessories the Company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader productlines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base Historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windowsbased personal computershave aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins An increasing number of Internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with theCompanys existing products The Companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  10Table of ContentsTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the Company must successfully managefrequent product introductions and transitions  Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Companycompetes the Company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products The success of new product introductionsdepends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability ofapplication software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipateddemand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction Accordingly the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions The Company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and valueadded resellers many ofwhom distribute products from competing manufacturers The Company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsizedbusinesses through its online and retail stores  Carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone typically subsidize users purchases ofthe device There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers Many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions Some resellers have perceived theexpansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Companys products Such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution andsale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores withCompany employees and contractors and improving product placement displays These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue The financial condition of these resellers couldweaken these resellers could stop distributing the Companys products or uncertainty regarding demand for the Companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk The Company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value andaccrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components The Company also reviews its longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairmentwhenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable If the Company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceedsits fair value Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the Company will not incuradditional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes  TheCompany must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments Consistent with industry practice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contractsand open orders in each case based on projected demand Where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier Purchase commitments typicallycover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days Because the Companys markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the Company will forecastincorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  11Table of ContentsFuture operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain components insufficient quantities  Because the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the Company is subject to significantsupply and pricing risks Many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations While the Company has entered into agreements forthe supply of many components there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead tobusiness failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the Companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components The followon effects from global economic conditions on theCompanys suppliers described in Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company above also could affect the Companys ability to obtain components Therefore the Companyremains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases  The Company and other participants in the markets for mobilecommunication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest ofthese industries The Companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have maturedor manufacturing capacity has increased Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized tomeet the Companys requirements The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of whom arelocated outside of the US  Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcingpartners located primarily in Asia The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management While these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the Companys direct control over production anddistribution It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the Companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions Although arrangements with these partners maycontain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability While theCompany relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur  TheCompany relies on solesourced outsourcing partners in the US Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia for final assembly of substantially all of the Companyshardware products Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Companys cost or supply of components or finished goods In addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinationsmay be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health orpolitical issues  The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and hasmade prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financialproblems or other disruptions in their business the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted  TheCompanys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Companys reputation The Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects Sophisticated operating systemsoftware and applications such as those sold by the Company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation The Companys online services may from time to time experience outagesservice slowdowns or errors Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services itsells Failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Companys reputation   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  12Table of ContentsThe Company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to theCompany on commercially reasonable terms or at all  The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content throughthe iTunes Store This includes the right to make available music movies TV shows and books currently available through the iTunes Store The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms anddo not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all Some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action tomake it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future Other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the Companys access to or increase the cost of suchcontent The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach Failure to obtain the right to make available thirdparty digitalcontent or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Some thirdparty digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions If requirements changethe Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner In addition certain countrieshave passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with theCompanys content providers  The Companys future performance depends in part on support fromthirdparty software developers  The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardwareproducts depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services There is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications andservices for the Companys products If thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Companys products customers may choose not to buy the Companys products With respect to its Mac products the Company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications andservices depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the Companys products compared to Windowsbased products This analysis may be basedon factors such as the market position of the Company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services If the Companys minorityshare of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Macs prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Companys Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources todeveloping and upgrading software for the larger Windows market  With respect to iOS devices the Company relies on the continued availability anddevelopment of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the App Store iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choosenot to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers As with applications for the Companys Mac products the availability and development of theseapplications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the Companys iOS devices rather than its competitors platforms such as Android If developers focus their effortson these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the Companys iOS devices may suffer  The Companyrelies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all Many of the Companys products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties Based on past experienceand industry practice the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms There is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all Failure to obtain the right to usethirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial conditionand operating results   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  13Table of ContentsThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being foundto have infringed on intellectual property rights  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet beenfully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future  For example technologycompanies including many of the Companys competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights In addition patent holding companies seek to monetizepatents they have purchased or otherwise obtained As the Company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase In particular the Companys cellular enabled products compete withmobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the Company has significantly increased The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in anumber of US jurisdictions and before the US International Trade Commission as well as internationally in various countries The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actuallitigants the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop noninfringing technology it may be required topay substantial damages or royalties to a thirdparty or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products In certain cases the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licensescan be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur These licenses may also significantly increase the Companys operating expenses Regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the Companys operations and distracting tomanagement In recognition of these considerations the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation  In managements opinionthere is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual propertyrights However the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain  Although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote ifone or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adverselyaffected Further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materiallyadversely affect its financial condition and operating results  The Company is subject to laws and regulations

devices on more than one carriers network These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on theirnetworks These certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the Company from selling certainproducts Compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent fromjurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business Any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in theaggregate make the Companys products and services less attractive to the Companys customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the

economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained fromforeign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customersin certain international markets There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses  TheCompanys Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties The Companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory andpersonnel The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate salesand marketing activities Because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores Due to the high cost structure associated with the Retailsegment a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs Many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the Companys control pose risks and uncertainties These risks anduncertainties include but are not limited to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the Companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation theCompanys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the US costs associated with unanticipated

Companys profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels The Companys software accessories and service and supportcontracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Companys other products Gross margins on the Companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing andconfiguration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations The Companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners In addition the Companys grossmargin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening US dollar price competitionor the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing  The Company has typicallyexperienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and

experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future Additionally theCompany the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance Pricevolatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time The Company believes its stock price reflects expectations of future growth andprofitability The Company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated Future dividends are subject todeclaration by the Companys Board of Directors and the Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares If the Company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growthprofitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention The Companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the US dollar versus localcurrencies  The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonUS dollar denominated salesand operating expenses worldwide Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar adversely affects the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the Company to raiseinternational pricing potentially reducing demand for the Companys products Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could bematerially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations In some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening or at all whichwould adversely affect the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currency denominated sales and earnings Conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar while generally beneficial to the Companysforeign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit Additionally strengthening of foreign currenciesmay also increase the Companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins  The Companyuses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of theadverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited

Ireland with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Companys Irishsubsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid If the European Commission were to take a final

authorities and governmental bodies The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting fromthese examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes There can

met at the time the product is shipped For online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the US and for certain other sales the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Companyretains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digitalcontent sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactionsi standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware For multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality undeliveredsoftware elements that relate to the hardware products essential software andor undelivered nonsoftware services the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices In such circumstances the Companyuses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value VSOE ii thirdparty evidence of selling price TPE andiii best estimate of selling price ESP VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable ESPs reflect the Companys bestestimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis  For sales of qualifying versions ofiOS devices Mac and Apple TV the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers The Company also provides various nonsoftware services to owners of qualifyingversions of iOS devices and Mac Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the nonsoftware services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Companys ESPs Revenueallocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services based on the Companys ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services areexpected to be provided for each of these devices which ranges from two to four years   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  39Table of ContentsThe Companys process for determining ESPs involves managements judgment and considers multiplefactors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable Should future facts and circumstances change the Companys ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for software upgradesand nonsoftware services related to future sales of these devices could change Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights the estimated or actualcosts incurred to provide nonsoftware services and the estimated period software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs For transactionsinvolving price protection the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met TheCompanys policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses For the Companys other customer incentive programs the estimated costis recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historicalexperience Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue Additionally certain customer incentive programs require management toestimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive Managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs If a greater than estimated proportion ofcustomers redeems such incentives the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the Companys results of operations Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities  TheCompanys investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in theCompanys Consolidated Balance Sheets Changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities impact the Companys net income only when such securities are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized Realized gains andlosses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is otherthantemporarily impaired which wouldrequire the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made In making this judgment the Company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its costthe financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the Companys intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis The Companysassessment on whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security Inventory Valuation and Valuation of ManufacturingRelated Assets and Estimated Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing processequipment including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities In addition the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components The Companyrecords a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value The Company performs a detailed review ofinventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends The Company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets andinventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amountby which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  40Table of ContentsThe industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product andcomponent obsolescence and demand changes In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory inventory prepayments andor manufacturingrelated capital assets These circumstances include futuredemand or market conditions for the Companys products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Companys product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assetsor significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Companys suppliers that hold any of the Companys manufacturing process equipment or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment Such writedownswould adversely affect the Companys results of operations in the period when the writedowns were recorded  The Company records accruals forestimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled Consistent with industry practice the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts andopen orders in each case based on projected demand Where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier Purchase commitments typically cover the Companysforecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products if the Companys product development plans change or ifthere is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products then the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in theperiod when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded  Warranty Costs The Company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claimrates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience Each quarter the Company reevaluates these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recordedwarranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimatedwarranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Companys results of operations  Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations The provision for income taxes is computedusing the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and foroperating losses and tax credit carryforwards Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized orsettled The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained onexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihoodof being realized upon ultimate settlement  Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may begenerated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets In the event that the Company determines all or part ofthe net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made In addition the calculation of tax liabilitiesinvolves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact onthe Companys financial condition and operating results   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  41Table of ContentsLegal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I Item 3 of this Form 10K under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business The Company records a liability when itis probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated In the opinion of managementthere was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies However the outcome of legalproceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty Therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against theCompany in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected  Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on astandalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures Given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatorynature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates Further the recognition of the gains and lossesrelated to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results Interest Rate Risk  While the Company is exposed to interestrate fluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries the Companys interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in US interest rates Changes in US interest rates affect the interest earned onthe Companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Companys debt Investments  The Companys investment policy and strategyare focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Companys liquidity requirements The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives The Companys exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio The Company typically invests inhighlyrated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk ofprincipal loss  To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio the Companyperformed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve Based on investment positions as ofSeptember 27 2014 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 34 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio As of September 28 2013 a similar 100 basispoint increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a 27 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  42Table of ContentsDebt  In April2014 the Board of Directors authorized the Company to issue Commercial Paper pursuant to a commercial paper program As of September 27 2014 the Company had 63 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding with maturities generally less thannine months  In the third quarters of 2014 and 2013 the Company issued 120 billion and 170 billion of longterm debt respectively The debtissuances included floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of 290 billion collectively the Notes The Company has entered and may enter in the future into interest rate swaps tomanage interest rate risk on the Notes Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments In the third quarter of 2014 the Companyentered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 90 billion which effectively converted most of the fixedrate notes into floatingrate notes and in the third quarter of 2013 the Company entered into interest rate swapswith an aggregate notional amount of 30 billion which effectively converted the floatingrate notes into fixedrate notes As of September 27 2014 a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on theCompanys debt to increase by 110 million on an annualized basis  Further details regarding the Companys debt is provided in Part IIItem 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6 Debt  ForeignCurrency Risk  In general the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the US dollar Accordingly changes in exchange rates and inparticular a strengthening of the US dollar will negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in US dollars There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitivepressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward andoption contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreignsubsidiaries The Companys practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to 12 months However the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasonsincluding but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  To provide a meaningfulassessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Companys foreign currency derivative positions the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk VAR model to assess the potential impact offluctuations in exchange rates The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a givenconfidence interval to the Companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool The model assumesnormal market conditions Forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model Based on the results of the model the Company estimates with 95 confidence a maximumoneday loss in fair value of 240 million as of September 27 2014 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 201 million as of September 28 2013 Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes theloss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures  Actual futuregains and losses associated with the Companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 27 2014 due to the inherent limitations associated with predictingthe timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchanges rates and the Companys actual exposures and positions   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  43Table of ContentsItem 8Financial Statements and

software digital content and applications accessories and service and supportcontracts The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has beenshipped and title risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred For most of the Companys product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped For online sales to individuals for some sales to educationcustomers in the US and for certain other sales the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit The Company recognizes revenue from thesale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance TheCompany recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales

Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customerTherefore the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to thirdparty appdevelopers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations  The Company recordsdeferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware

expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience Revenue is recorded net of taxescollected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables For multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality undeliveredsoftware elements that relate to the hardware products essential software and undelivered nonsoftware services the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices In such circumstances the Company usesa hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value VSOE ii thirdparty evidence of selling price TPE andiii best estimate of selling price ESP VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable ESPs reflect the Companys bestestimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis For multielement arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance the Company allocatesrevenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone iPad and iPod touch iOS devices Mac and Apple TV the Company has indicated it may from timeto time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers Essential software for iOS devices includes iOS and related applications and forMac includes OS X and related applications The Company also provides various nonsoftware services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangementsinvolving the sale of these devices The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale The second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase ofiOS devices Mac and Apple TV to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the products essential software The third deliverable is the nonsoftware services to be provided toqualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables the allocation of revenue is based onthe Companys ESPs Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met Revenue allocated to the embeddedunspecified   Apple Inc  2014 Form 10K  51Table of Contentssoftware upgrade rights and the nonsoftware services is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected tobe provided for each of these devices which ranges from two to four years Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software including estimated warranty costs are recognized at the time of sale Costs incurred to providenonsoftware services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred The Companys process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon theunique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable The Company believes its customers would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights for the essential software included with its qualifying hardware products This view isprimarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade rights do not obligate the Company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at all and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered The Company alsobelieves its customers would be unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the nonsoftware services because other companies offer similar services at little or no cost to users Therefore the Company has concluded that if it were to sellupgrade rights or access to the nonsoftware services on a standalone basis including those rights and services attached to iOS devices Mac and Apple TV the selling prices would be relatively low Key factors considered by the Company indeveloping the ESPs for software upgrade rights include prices charged by the Company for similar offerings market trends in the pricing of Applebranded and thirdparty Mac and iOS compatible software the nature of the upgrade rights egunspecified versus specified and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product The Company may also consider additional factors as appropriate including the impact of other products and servicesprovided to customers the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist productspecific business objectives and the length of time a particular version of a device has been available When relevant the same factors are considered by theCompany in developing ESPs for offerings such as the nonsoftware services with additional consideration given to the estimated cost to provide such services In 2014 2013 and 2012 the Companys combined ESPs for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the rights to receive the nonsoftware servicesincluded with its qualifying hardware devices have ranged from 5 to 40 As of September 27 2014 the combined ESPs for Mac was 40 and for iPhone and iPad ranged from 15 to 25 Revenue allocated to such rights is deferred and recognized ona straightline basis over the estimated period the rights are expected to be provided for each device which ranges from two to four years  Shipping Costs For all periods presented amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue and the Companysshipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales  Warranty Costs The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized The Companyassesses the adequacy of its preexisting warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates Software Development Costs  Research and developmentRD costs are expensed as incurred Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established andending when a product is available for general release to

all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized ordisclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participantsat the measurement date When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transactand the marketbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk Fair value is estimated by applyingthe following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement Level 1  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2  Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical orsimilar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities Level 3  Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participantswould use in pricing the asset or liability  The Companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds andcertain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Companys debt instruments and all other financialinstruments all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fairvalue The

expected future cash flows on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities However the Company maychoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than aportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates  To help protect gross margins fromfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates certain of the Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the US dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue The Companys subsidiaries whose functionalcurrency is not the US dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreigncurrency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months  To help protect the net investment in a foreignoperation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange rates  The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to partially offset the foreign currencyexchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies  The Companymay enter into interest rate swaps options or other instruments to manage interest rate risk These

essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currentlyobtained from single or limited sources In addition the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers Therefore many components used by theCompany including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operatingresults  The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the Company oftenutilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased If theCompanys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys financial condition and operating results could bematerially adversely affected The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtainsufficient quantities from an alternative source Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized tomeet the Companys requirements  The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guaranteethat the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financialcondition and operating results  Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by
