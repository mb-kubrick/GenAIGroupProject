sales in 2015 2014 or 2013 Competition  The markets for the Companys products andservices are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantiallyincreased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices The Companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systemshave aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on grossmargins Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price product features including security features relative price and performance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software andaccessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation  The Company is focused on expanding itsmarket opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices These markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants The Company expects competition in these markets tointensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive thanthose they currently offer These markets are characterized by aggressive pricing practices frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors andprice sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses  The Companys digital content services have faced significant competition from othercompanies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovativeproducts and services in each of the markets in which it competes The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware iOS devices Mac Apple Watch and Apple TV software iOS OS XwatchOS and tvOS online services and distribution of digital content and applications Internet Services Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products andservices at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings  Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currentlyobtained from single or limited sources In addition the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers Therefore many components used by theCompany including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operatingresults   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  5Table of ContentsThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and the Company oftenutilizes custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased If theCompanys supply of components were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adverselyaffected The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities froman alternative source Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companysrequirements  The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the Company will beable to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operatingresults  While some Mac computers are manufactured in the US and Ireland substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currentlymanufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations Certain of these outsourcingpartners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the Companys operating results couldbe adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 daysResearch and Development  Because the industries in which theCompany competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to themarketplace The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and to expand the range of its product offerings through RD licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses andtechnology Total RD expense was 81 billion 60 billion and 45 billion in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively  Patents Trademarks Copyrights andLicenses  The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories softwareand services The Company has registered or has applied for trademarks and service marks in the US and a number of foreign countries Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents copyrights trademarks and service marks is animportant factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuingthousands of patent applications around the world Over time the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents around the world The Company holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services Nosingle patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties It may be necessary in the future to seekor renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products processes and services While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could beobtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certaincomponents of the Companys products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others From time to time the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents orother intellectual property rights of third parties  Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data During 2015 the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 35 and 65 respectively of total netsales Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II Item 7 of this Form 10K under the subheading Segment Operating Performance and in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11 Segment Information and Geographic Data   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  6Table of ContentsWhile some Mac computers are manufactured in the US and Ireland substantially all of the Companyshardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the US Asia and Europe Margins onsales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international traderegulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10Kin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies  Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonalholiday demand Additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as thesechannels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches Net sales can also be affected when consumers anddistributors anticipate a product introduction However neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductionsfuture net sales or financial performance  Warranty  TheCompany offers a limited parts and labor warranty on most of its hardware products The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser The Company also offers a90day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products In certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribedby statute typically at least two years In addition where available consumers may purchase APP or AC which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products Backlog  In the Companys experience the actual amount ofproduct backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects In particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages Backlog is oftenreduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply Because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance Employees  As of September 26 2015 the Company hadapproximately 110000 fulltime equivalent employees  Available Information The Companys Annual Report on Form 10K Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q Current Reports on Form 8K and amendments to reports

following information should be read in conjunction with Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Resultsof Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10K The business financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknownincluding but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the Companys actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financialcondition and operating results Any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the Companys business financial condition operating results and stock price Because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the Companys financial condition and operating results past financialperformance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company The Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions Uncertainty about global and regionaleconomic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income orasset values andor other factors These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Companys products and services Demand also could differ materially from the Companys expectationsas a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the US to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the US dollar Other factors that could influence worldwide orregional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumerspending behavior These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Companys products and services  In theevent of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in thecredit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets This could have a number of effects on the Companys business including the insolvency or financial instability ofoutsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development andor manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchasesof the Companys products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the Companys ability to issue new debt Other income and expense also could vary

other investments changes in interest rates increases ordecreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actualamounts realized in the future on the Companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them Global markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and theCompany may be unable to compete effectively in these markets  The Companys products and services compete in highly competitive globalmarkets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformancecharacteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers  TheCompanys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace The Company believes it is unique in that itdesigns and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services As a result the Company must make significant investments in RD The Companycurrently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks In contrast many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily throughaggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products withattractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Companys intellectual property the Companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  8Table of ContentsThe Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating systemand also markets related thirdparty digital content and applications The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as establishedhardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market Additionally the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices andattempt to imitate the Companys product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer The Company competes withbusiness models that include content provided to users for free The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications Some of the Companys competitors have greater experience product breadthand distribution channels than the Company Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources andor experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at aloss The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions TheCompanys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Companys ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X which has a minority market share in the personal computer market This market has beencontracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably Windows In the market for personal computers and accessories the Company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader productlines lower priced products and a larger installed customer base Historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windowsbased personal computershave aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins An increasing number of internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with theCompanys existing products The Companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes the Company must continually introduce newproducts services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products The success of new productintroductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues theavailability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs tomeet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction Accordingly the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions andtransitions  The Company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and valueadded resellers many ofwhom distribute products from competing manufacturers The Company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsizedbusinesses through its online and retail stores  Carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone typically subsidize users purchases ofthe device There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  9Table of ContentsMany resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economicconditions Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Companys direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Companys products Such a perception could discourage resellers frominvesting resources in the distribution and sale of the Companys products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales includingstaffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue Thefinancial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the Companys products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Companys products could cause resellers to reduce their orderingand marketing of the Companys products  The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchasecommitment cancellation risk  The Company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceedanticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components The Company also reviews its longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilitiesand inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable If the Company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by whichthe carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can begiven that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments Consistent with industrypractice components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders supplier contracts and open orders in each case based on projected demand Where appropriate the purchases are applied to inventory componentprepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier Purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days Because the Companys markets are volatilecompetitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments Future operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities Because the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks Manycomponents including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many componentsthere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for thesupplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the Companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Companys suppliers describedin Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company above also could affect the Companys ability to obtain components Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risksof supply shortages and price increases  The Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personalcomputers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries The Companys newproducts often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increasedContinued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meetthe Companys requirements The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  10Table of ContentsThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided byoutsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the US  Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed inwhole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management While these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the Companysdirect control over production and distribution It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the Companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions Althougharrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defector warranty liability While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur The Company relies on solesourced outsourcing partners in the US Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and onoutsourcing partners primarily located in Asia for final assembly of substantially all of the Companys hardware products Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Companys cost or supply of componentsor finished goods In addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology systemfailures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues  The Company hasinvested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements While these arrangements help ensure thesupply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value ofthese assets could be negatively impacted  The Companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to timethat can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Companys reputation  The Company sells complex hardware andsoftware products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects Sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the Company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with thesoftwares intended operation The Companys online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties There can beno assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells Failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Companys reputation The Company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable termsor at all  The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content This includes the right to sell currentlyavailable music movies TV shows and books The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if atall Some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute theircontent in the future Other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the Companys access to or increase the cost of such content The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonableprices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach Failure to obtain the right to make available thirdparty digital content or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms could have a materialadverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results  Some thirdparty digital content providers require the Company toprovide digital rights management and other security solutions If requirements change the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license suchsolutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner In addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection ofcontent and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Companys content providers   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  11Table of ContentsThe Companys future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers  The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardwareproducts depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services There is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications andservices for the Companys products If thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Companys products customers may choose not to buy the Companys products With respect to its Mac products the Company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications andservices depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the Companys products compared to Windowsbased products This analysis may be basedon factors such as the market position of the Company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services If the Companys minorityshare of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Macs prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Companys Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources todeveloping and upgrading software for the larger Windows market  With respect to iOS devices the Company relies on the continued availability anddevelopment of compelling and innovative software applications which are distributed through a single distribution channel the App Store iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choosenot to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers As with applications for the Companys Mac products the availability and development of theseapplications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the Companys iOS devices rather than its competitors platforms such as Android Ifdevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the Companys iOS devices may suffer The Company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonableterms or at all  Many of the Companys products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those thirdparties Based on past experience and industry practice the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms There is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at allFailure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on theCompanys financial condition and operating results  The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedingssuch as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims thathave not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and additional claims may arise in the future  Forexample technology companies including many of the Companys competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights In addition patent holding companiesseek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained As the Company has grown the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase In particular the Companys cellular enabled productscompete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios and the number of patent claims against the Company has significantly increased The Company is vigorously defendinginfringement actions in courts in a number of US jurisdictions and before the US International Trade Commission as well as internationally in various countries The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantialdamages  Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential oractual litigants the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop noninfringing technology it may berequired to pay substantial damages or royalties to a thirdparty or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products In certain cases the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licensescan be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur These licenses may also significantly increase the Companys operating expenses   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  12Table of ContentsRegardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to theCompanys operations and distracting to management In recognition of these considerations the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation In managements opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excessof a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights However the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain Although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in areporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Further such an outcome could result in significantcompensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the Companys costs and individually or inthe aggregate adversely affect the Companys business  The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its

content consumer protection real estatebilling ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controlsand cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety  By way of example laws andregulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change Such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacturedistribution and use of devices locking devices to a carriers network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardizationbodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks These certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipmentdates or could preclude the Company from selling certain products Compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerousand expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business Any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or intheir interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the Companys products and services less attractive to the Companys customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the Company to changeor limit its business practices The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the Companys employees contractors or agents will

improvements information systems inventory and personnel The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space Certain stores have been designed and built toserve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities Because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than theCompanys more typical retail stores Due to the high cost structure associated with the Companys retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant leasetermination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs  Many factors unique to retail operations some of whichare beyond the Companys control pose risks and uncertainties These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the Companysinability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the Companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the US costsassociated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the Companys inability

expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate The Companys profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels The Companys software accessories and service and supportcontracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Companys other products Gross margins on the Companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing andconfiguration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations The Companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners In addition the Companys grossmargin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening US dollar price competitionor the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing  The Company has typicallyexperienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses Further theCompany generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such aslowerthananticipated demand for the Companys products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the Companys logistics components supply or manufacturing partners The Companys stock price is subject to volatility The Companys stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future Additionally theCompany the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance Pricevolatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growthand profitability The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated Future dividends aresubject to declaration by the Companys Board of Directors and the Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growthprofitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention The Companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the US dollar versus localcurrencies  The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonUS dollardenominated salesand operating expenses worldwide Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar adversely affects the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the Company to raiseinternational pricing potentially reducing demand for the Companys products Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could bematerially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations In some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening or at all whichwould adversely affect the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings Conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar while generally beneficial to the Companysforeign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit Additionally strengthening of foreign currenciesmay also increase the Companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins  The Companyuses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of theadverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place  The Companyis exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio  Given the global nature of its business theCompany has both domestic and international investments Credit ratings and pricing of the Companys investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk orother factors As a result the value and liquidity of the Companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially Therefore although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cashequivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  16Table of ContentsThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontradereceivables and prepayments related to longterm supply

trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty financingarrangements or credit insurance The Companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited The Company also has unsecuredvendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company In addition the Company has made prepayments associated withlongterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components As of September 26 2015 a significant portion of the Companys trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor nontradereceivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendornontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure toadditional tax liabilities  The Company is subject to taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions including Ireland where a numberof the Companys subsidiaries are organized Due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change The Companys effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix ofearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and

product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles producttransitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the US dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Companys sales mix towardsproducts with lower gross margins In response to competitive pressures the

has entered into indemnification agreements with itsdirectors and executive officers Under these agreements the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advanceexpenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history ofprior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim However the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation offinancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial

circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities Actual results may differ fromthese estimates and such differences may be material  Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are thoserelated to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal andother contingencies Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates aboutinherently uncertain matters The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors Revenue Recognition  Net sales consist primarily of revenuefrom the sale of hardware software digital content and applications accessories and service and support contracts The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixedor determinable and collection is probable Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred For most of the Companys product sales these criteriaare met at the time the product is shipped For online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the US and for certain other sales the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Companyretains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit For payment terms in excess of the Companys standard payment terms revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales priceis fixed or determinable such as a successful history of collection without concession on comparable arrangements The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to thefunctionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance

deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable ESPs reflect theCompanys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold

price protection and other customer incentiveprograms For transactions involving price protection the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognitionhave been met The Companys policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses For the Companys other customer incentive programsthe estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on theCompanys historical experience Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue Additionally certain customer incentiveprograms require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive Managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs If agreater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the Companys operating results Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities  TheCompanys investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in theCompanys Consolidated Balance Sheets Changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities impact the Companys net income only when such securities are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized Realized gains andlosses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is otherthantemporarily impaired which wouldrequire the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made In making this judgment the Company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its costthe financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the Companys intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis The Companysassessment on whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new

exceeds its fair value  The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product andcomponent obsolescence and demand changes In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory andor manufacturingrelated assets These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for theCompanys products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Companys product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in thefinancial condition of one or more of the Companys suppliers that hold any of the Companys manufacturingrelated assets or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment Such

substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products a change in the Companys product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of theCompanys products the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded Warranty Costs  The Company accrues for the estimated cost ofwarranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected costperclaim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typicalexperience The Company regularly reviews these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities or the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary If actual productfailure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Companys financial condition and operating results Income Taxes  The Company records a tax provision for theanticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequencesof temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates thatapply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely thannot to be realized  The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position willbe sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement  Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including incomethat may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets In the event that the Company determines allor part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made In addition the calculation of taxliabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a materialimpact on the Companys financial condition and operating results  Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I Item 3 of this Form 10K under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business The Company records a liability when itis probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated In the opinion of managementthere was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims However the outcome of legalproceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty Therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against theCompany in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  35Table of ContentsItem 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on astandalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures Given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatorynature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates Further the recognition of the gains and lossesrelated to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results Interest Rate Risk  The Companys exposure to changes ininterest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio and outstanding debt While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the Companys interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations inUS interest rates Changes in US interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paidon the Companys debt  The Companys investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting theCompanys liquidity requirements The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives The Company typically invests in highlyrated securities and itsinvestment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss To provide ameaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investmentportfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve Based on investment positions as of September 26 2015 and September 27 2014 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities wouldresult in a 43 billion and 34 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity As of September 26 2015 and September 27 2014 the Company had outstanding floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for anaggregate carrying amount of 560 billion and 290 billion respectively The Company has entered and may enter in the future into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt Interest rate swaps allow theCompany to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments Gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the relatedhedging instrument A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Companys debt as of September 26 2015 and September 27 2014 to increase by 200 million and 110 million on an annualizedbasis respectively  Further details regarding the Companys debt is provided in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6 Debt  Foreign Currency Risk In general the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the US dollar Accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular astrengthening of the US dollar will negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in US dollars There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressureswhen there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and optioncontracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiariesIn addition the Company has entered and may enter in the future into nondesignated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreigndenominated debt issuances The Companyspractice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures typically for up to 12 months However the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited toaccounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  36Table of ContentsTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of theCompanys foreign currency derivative positions the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk VAR model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates The VAR model consisted of using aMonte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the Companys foreign currency derivativepositions due to adverse movements in rates The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool The model assumes normal market conditions Forecasted transactions firm commitments andassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model Based on the results of the model the Company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 342 million as of September 26 2015compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 240 million as of September 27 2014 Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset byincreases in the fair value of the underlying exposures  Actual future gains and losses associated with the Companys investment portfolio andderivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 26 2015 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currencyexchanges rates and the Companys actual exposures and positions   Apple Inc  2015

accessories and serviceand support contracts The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable Product is considered delivered to the customer onceit has been shipped and title risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred For most of the Companys product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped For online sales to individuals for some sales toeducation customers in the US and for certain other sales the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit For payment terms in excess ofthe Companys standard payment terms revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable such as a successful history of collection without concession oncomparable arrangements The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordancewith general revenue recognition accounting guidance The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software productsii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware  Forthe sale of most thirdparty products the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products retains

Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store the Company doesnot determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer Therefore the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale The portion ofthe gross amount billed to customers that is

Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables For multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality undeliveredsoftware elements that relate to the hardware products essential software and undelivered nonsoftware services the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices In such circumstances the Company usesa hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value VSOE ii thirdparty evidence of selling price TPE andiii best estimate of selling price ESP VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable ESPs reflect the Companys bestestimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis For multielement arrangements accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance the Company allocatesrevenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone iPad and iPod touch iOS devices Mac Apple Watch and Apple TV the Company has indicated itmay from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the devices essential software andor nonsoftware services free of charge The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involvingthe sale of these devices The first deliverable which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale The seconddeliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the products essential software The third deliverable is the nonsoftwareservices to be provided to qualifying devices The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables the allocation of revenue is basedon the Companys ESPs Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met Revenue allocated to the embeddedunspecified software upgrade rights and the nonsoftware services is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided Cost of sales related todelivered hardware and related essential software including estimated warranty costs are recognized at the time of sale Costs incurred to provide nonsoftware services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred and engineering and sales andmarketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred  The Companys process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOEor

recognized The Companyassesses the adequacy of its accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates Software Development Costs  Research and developmentRD costs are expensed as incurred Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established andending when a product is available for general release to customers In most instances the Companys products are released soon after technological

thatmay be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments Sharebased compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted stock units RSUs is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common stock on thedate of grant The Company recognizes sharebased compensation cost over the awards requisite service period on a straightline basis for timebased RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on the achievement of performanceconditions The Company recognizes a benefit from sharebased compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity if an excess tax benefit is realized In addition the Company recognizes the indirect effects of sharebasedcompensation on RD tax credits foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations Further information regarding sharebased compensation can be found in Note 9 Benefit Plans Income Taxes  The provision for income taxes is computedusing the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and foroperating losses and tax credit carryforwards Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to berealized or settled The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained onexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihoodof being realized upon settlement See Note 5 Income Taxes for additional information  Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stockoutstanding during the period Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common

losses believed to beotherthantemporary which are reported in earnings in the current period The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company accounts for itsderivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value  For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure tovariability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders equity and reclassified into earningsin the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument if any is recognized in earnings in the current period To receive hedge accountingtreatment cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions For options designated as cash flow hedges changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedgeeffectiveness and are recognized in earnings  For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or aliability and that are designated as fair value hedges both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period For derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of thenet investment in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment Forforward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the

allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors including historical experience age of the accountsreceivable balances credit quality of the Companys customers current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers ability to pay Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of costcomputed using the firstin firstout method and net realizable value Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period As of September 26 2015 andSeptember 27 2014 the Companys inventories consist primarily of finished goods  Property Plant and Equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at cost Depreciation is computed by use of the straightline method overthe estimated useful lives of the assets which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building between one to five years for machinery and equipment including product tooling and manufacturing processequipment and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for leasehold improvements The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internaluse software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage Capitalized costsrelated to internaluse software are amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from three to five years Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was 92 billion 69billion and 58 billion during 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively  LongLived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets The Company reviews property plant and equipment inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles excluding goodwill forimpairment Longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amountsto future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate If property plant and equipment inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals theamount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value  The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets withindefinite useful lives rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired The Company performs its goodwill and intangibleasset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2015 2014 and 2013 The Company established reporting units based onits current reporting structure For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit In 2015 and 2014 the Companys goodwill was primarilyallocated to the Americas and Europe reporting units  The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimateduseful lives and reviews these assets for impairment The Company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years Fair Value Measurements  The Company applies fair valueaccounting for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis The Company defines fair value as the price that would bereceived from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recordedat fair value the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the marketbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such asrisks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization withinthe hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement  Level 1  Quoted prices in active marketsfor identical assets or liabilities  Level 2  Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets andliabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities Level 3  Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participantswould use in pricing the asset or liability   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  48Table of ContentsThe Companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certainmarketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Companys debt instruments and all other financial instrumentsall of which have counterparties with high credit ratings were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fairvalue The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments  Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its nonUS dollar functional currency subsidiaries into US dollars using exchange rates in effectat the end of each period Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included inAOCI in shareholders equity The Companys subsidiaries that use the US dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period and inventories property andnonmonetary assets and

deterioration and duration management The maturities of the Companys longterm marketable securities generally range from one to five years As of September 26 2015 the Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary innature and does not consider any of its investments otherthantemporarily impaired The Company typically invests in highlyrated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer The policygenerally requires investments to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio When evaluating an investmentfor otherthantemporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto changes in market interest ratesand the Companys intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investments cost basis Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company may usederivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities However the Companymay choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more thana portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates  To help protect gross margins fromfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates certain of the Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the US dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue and subsidiaries whose functional currency is notthe US dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies The Company may enter into forward contracts option contracts or otherinstruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12months  To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the Company may enterinto foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates In addition the Company may use nonderivative financial instruments suchas its foreign currencydenominated debt as economic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries In both of these cases the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges   Apple Inc

remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies  TheCompany may enter into interest rate swaps options or other instruments to manage interest rate risk These instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense or changes in fair value of the Companys term debt or investmentsThe Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges The Companys hedged interest rate transactions as of September 26 2015 are expected to be recognized within 10 years Cash Flow Hedges  The effective portions of cash flow hedgesare recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue isrecognized and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flowhedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other incomeexpense net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedgesare recognized in other incomeexpense net  Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be dedesignated as hedges when it isprobable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent twomonth time period Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassifiedimmediately into other incomeexpense net Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other incomeexpense net unless they are redesignated as hedges of other transactions Net Investment Hedges  The effective portions of net investmenthedges are

one measure of the transaction volumeoutstanding and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss The credit risk amounts represent the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding orunsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract based on thencurrent currency or interest rates at each respective date The Companys exposure to credit lossand market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Companys derivative instruments it does not reflect the gains or losses associated withthe exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures will depend on actual marketconditions during the remaining life of the instruments  The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements which are designed to reducecredit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty To further limit credit risk the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the netfair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets The net cashcollateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was 10 billion as of September 26 2015 and 21 billion as of September 27 2014 Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Companys derivative contracts the Company is allowed to netsettle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other As of September 26 2015 and September 27 2014 the potential effects of these rights of setoff associated with the Companys derivative contractsincluding the effects of collateral would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of 22 billion and 16 billion respectively resulting in net derivative liabilities of 78 million and 549million respectively  Accounts Receivable  Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers valueadded resellerssmall and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers however the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk Inaddition when possible the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring thirdparty financing loans or leases to support credit exposure These creditfinancingarrangements are directly between the thirdparty financing company and the end customer As such the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements As of September 26 2015 the Company had one customer that represented 10 or more of total trade receivables which accounted for 12 As ofSeptember 27 2014 the Company had two customers that represented 10 or more of total trade receivables one of which accounted for 16 and the other 13 The Companys cellular network carriers

   The Company generally does not indemnify endusers of its operating system and application software against legal claimsthat the software infringes thirdparty intellectual property rights Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs andor damages in the event of aninfringement claim against the Company or an indemnified thirdparty In the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of endusers of itsoperating system or application software for infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of September 26 2015 or September 27 2014 In September 2015 the Company introduced the iPhone Upgrade Program which is available to customers who purchase an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in oneof its US physical retail stores and activate the purchased iPhone with one of the four national carriers The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a new iPhone provided certain conditions are met Oneof the conditions of this program requires the customer to finance the initial purchase price of the iPhone with a thirdparty lender Upon exercise of the tradein right and purchase of a new iPhone the Company satisfies the customersoutstanding balance due to the thirdparty lender on the original device The Company accounts for the tradein right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to theguarantee liability recognized within revenue  The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officersUnder these agreements the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by suchindividuals in connection with related legal proceedings It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnificationclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim However the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources a number of components are currentlyobtained from single or limited sources In addition the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers Therefore many components used by theCompany including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operatingresults   Apple Inc  2015 Form 10K  64Table of ContentsThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new productsintroduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturingcapacity has increased If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys financial conditionand operating results could be materially adversely affected The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original sourceor to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead ofcomponents customized to meet the Companys requirements  The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components howeverthere can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materiallyadversely affect its financial condition and operating results  Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured byoutsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations Certain of these outsourcing partners are thesolesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the Companys operating results could be adverselyaffected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments The Companys purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days Other OffBalance Sheet Commitments  Operating Leases The Company leases various equipment and facilities including retail space under noncancelable operating lease arrangements The Company does notcurrently utilize any other offbalance sheet financing arrangements The major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options As of September 26 2015 the Company had a totalof 463 retail stores Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years the majority of which are for 10 years and often contain multiyear renewal options As of September 26 2015 the Companys total future minimumlease payments under noncancelable operating leases were 63 billion of which 36 billion related to leases for retail space  Rent expense underall

finished products These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demandinformation supplied by the Company which typically covers periods up to 150 days The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers Consistent with industry practice the Company acquirescomponents through a combination of purchase orders

including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and commitments related to inventory prepayments advertising licensing RD internetand telecommunications services energy and other obligations  Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fullyadjudicated certain of which are discussed in Part I Item 1A of this Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors and in Part I Item 3 of this Form 10K under the heading Legal Proceedings In the opinion ofmanagement there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims However theoutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain Therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts inexcess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Apple Inc v Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al  OnAugust 24 2012 a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company 105 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States District Court Northern District of California San Jose Division OnMarch 6 2014 the District Court entered final judgment in favor of the Company in the amount of approximately 930 million On May 18 2015 the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in partthe decision of the District Court As a result the Court of Appeals ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of approximately 548 million with the District Court to determine supplemental damages and interest as well as damagesowed for products subject
