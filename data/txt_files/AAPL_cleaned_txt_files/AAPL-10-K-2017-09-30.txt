its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small and midsized businesses through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels such as thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and valueadded resellers During 2017 the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 28 and 72 respectively of total net sales The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products and services are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a highquality sales and aftersales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers To ensure a highquality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized the Company continues to build and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide The Companys retail stores are typically located at hightraffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable hightraffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a highquality customer buying experience and attract new customers The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice service and training and offer a wide selection of thirdparty hardware software and other accessories that

integration into information technology environments The Companys products are compatible with thousands of thirdparty business applications and services and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration No single customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales in 2017 2016 and 2015 Competition The markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices Many of the Companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price product features including security features relative price and performance product quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices These markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer These markets are characterized by aggressive price competition frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses The Companys digital content services have faced significant competition from other companies promoting their own digital music and content products and services including those offering free peertopeer music and video services The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware iOS devices Mac Apple Watch and Apple TV software iOS macOS watchOS and tvOS online services and distribution of digital content and applications Digital Content and Services Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources a few components are currently obtained from single or limited sources In addition the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers Therefore many components used by the Company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 5 Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia with some Mac computers manufactured in the US and Ireland A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations Certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments The Companys manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through RD licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology Total RD expense was 116 billion 100 billion and 81 billion in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services This includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the US and a number of foreign countries Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world Over time the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products processes and services While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the Companys products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others From time to time the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data During 2017 the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 37 and 63 respectively of total net sales Information regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II Item 7 of this Form 10K under the subheading Segment Operating Performance and in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11 Segment Information and Geographic Data Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are currently manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia with some Mac computers manufactured in the US and Ireland The supply and manufacture of a number of components is performed by solesourced outsourcing partners in the US Asia and Europe Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including tariffs and antidumping penalties Information regarding concentration in the available sources of supply of materials and products is set forth in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and often channel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction However neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 6 Warranty The Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original enduser The Company also offers a 90day limited warranty on the service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products In certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute typically at least two years In addition where available consumers may purchase APP or AC which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products Backlog In the Companys experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects In particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply Because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance Employees As of September 30 2017 the Company had approximately 123000 fulltime equivalent employees Available Infor mation The Companys Annual Report on Form 10K Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q Current Reports on Form 8K and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13a and 15d of the Securities Exchange

Risk Factors The following discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10K The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10K The business financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the Companys actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results Any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the Companys business financial condition operating results and stock price Because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the Companys financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company The Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values andor other factors These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Companys products and services Demand also could differ materially from the Companys expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the US to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the US dollar Other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets unemployment labor and healthcare costs access to credit consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Companys products and services In the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures there could be tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets This could have a number of effects on the Companys business including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development andor manufacture products resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Companys products failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions and restrictions on the Companys ability to issue new debt Other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments changes in interest rates increases or decreases in cash balances volatility in foreign exchange rates and changes in fair value of derivative instruments Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the Companys financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them Global markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets The Companys products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers The Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services As a result the Company must make significant investments in RD The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered andor has applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks In contrast many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Companys intellectual property the Companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 8 The Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related services including thirdparty digital content and applications The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships and the Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market Additionally the Company faces significant competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Companys product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications Some of the Companys competitors have greater experience product breadth and distribution channels than the Company Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources andor experience and a lower cost structure they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions The Companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Companys ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages The Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macOS which has a minority market share in the personal computer market This market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems most notably Windows In the market for personal computers and accessories the Company faces a significant number of competitors many of which have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed customer base Historically consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins An increasing number of internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Companys existing products The Companys financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes the Company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction Accordingly the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions The Company depends on the performance of distributors carriers and other resellers The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers national and regional retailers and valueadded resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers The Company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsized businesses through its retail and online stores Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone subsidize users purchases of the device There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue The financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the Companys products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 9 The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk The Company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components The Company also reviews its longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable If the Company determines that impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days Because the Companys markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments Future operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms Because the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks Many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the Companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Companys suppliers described in Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company above also could affect the Companys ability to obtain components Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases The Companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the US Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management While these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services or the Companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur The Company relies on solesourced outsourcing partners in the US Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia for final assembly of substantially all of the Companys hardware products Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Companys cost or supply of components or finished goods In addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions or economic business labor environmental public health or political issues The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 10 The Companys products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Companys reputation The Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects Sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those sold by the Company often contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the softwares intended operation The Companys online services may from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware software and services it sells Failure to do so could result in lost revenue significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Companys reputation The Company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers This includes the right to sell currently available music movies TV shows and books The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all Some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future Other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the Companys access to or increase the cost of such content The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach Failure to obtain the right to make thirdparty digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Some thirdparty digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions If requirements change the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner In addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Companys content providers The Companys future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services There is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Companys products If thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Companys products customers may choose not to buy the Companys products With respect to its Mac products the Company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software for the Companys products compared to Windowsbased products This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services If the Companys minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Macs prospects developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Companys Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market With respect to iOS devices the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications including applications distributed through the App Store iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers As with applications for the Companys Mac products the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining or upgrading software for the Companys iOS devices rather than its competitors platforms such as Android If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the Companys iOS devices may suffer Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 11 The Company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all Many of the Companys products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties Based on past experience and industry practice the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms There is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all Failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future In addition agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase In particular the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellularenabled products and new claims may arise in the future For example technology and other patentholding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of US jurisdictions and before the US International Trade Commission as well as internationally in various countries The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages Regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the Companys operations and distracting to management In recognition of these considerations the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur These agreements may also significantly increase the Companys operating expenses In managements opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights However the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain Although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the Companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Companys business The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas These US and foreign laws and regulations affect the Companys activities including but not limited to in areas of labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety By way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change Such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carriers network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks These certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the Company from selling certain products Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 12 Compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business Any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the Companys products and services less attractive to the Companys customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the Companys employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Companys policies and procedures The Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations Compliance with applicable US and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements environmental laws labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the Companys employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur In some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Companys brand international growth efforts and business The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs and political instability Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses The Companys retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties The Companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities Because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores Due to the high cost structure associated with the Companys retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs Many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the Companys control pose risks and uncertainties These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity as well as the Companys inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation the Companys failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the US costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and the Companys inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Companys ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated The Company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful The Companys business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions The Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the Companys business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Companys business by among other things preventing access to the Companys online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Companys products These events could materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 13 There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the Company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences The Companys business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information PII with respect to the Companys customers and employees The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data But these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results The Companys business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures may not be effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur which could materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results For example the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Companys information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information Such an incident could among other things impair the Companys ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the Companys stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the Company Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including PII affect many companies across various industries the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies As with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities For example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the Companys information technology systems To help protect customers and the Company the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Companys products and services In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data Health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Companys compliance with these obligations If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Companys agreements with healthcare institutions the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines Under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise The Companys business is subject to a variety of US and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection The Company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of PII In many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others In addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 14 The Companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel Much of the Companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its Chief Executive Officer executive team and other highly skilled employees Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in Silicon Valley where most of the Companys key personnel are located The Companys business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions War terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company its suppliers logistics providers manufacturing vendors and customers including channel partners The Companys business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters whether as a result of climate change or otherwise fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond its control Such events could decrease demand for the Companys products make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers including channel partners or to receive components from its suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply chain While the Companys suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Companys business and harm to the Companys reputation Should major public health issues including pandemics arise the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Companys manufacturing vendors and component suppliers The majority of the Companys RD activities its corporate headquarters information technology systems and other critical business operations including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters In the event of a natural disaster the Company could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate The Companys profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels The Companys software accessories and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Companys other products Gross margins on the Companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations The Companys direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners In addition the Companys gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product geographic or channel mix component cost increases the strengthening US dollar price competition or the introduction of new products including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses Further the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter such as lowerthananticipated demand for the Companys products issues with new product introductions an internal systems failure or failure of one of the Companys logistics components supply or manufacturing partners The Companys stock price is subject to volatility The Companys stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future Additionally the Company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Companys Board of Directors and the Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 15 The Companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the US dollar versus local currencies The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonUS dollardenominated sales and operating expenses worldwide Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar adversely affects the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the Companys products Margins on sales of the Companys products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations In some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollars strengthening or at all which would adversely affect the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings Conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar while generally beneficial to the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit Additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins The Company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio Given the global nature of its business the Company has both domestic and international investments Credit ratings and pricing of the Companys investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results economic risk political risk sovereign risk or other factors As a result the value and liquidity of the Companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially Therefore although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen The Company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and valueadded resellers The Company also sells its products directly to small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty financing arrangements or credit insurance The Companys exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited The Company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company In addition the Company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components As of September 30 2017 a significant portion of the Companys trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities The Company is subject to taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions including Ireland where a number of the Companys subsidiaries are organized Due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change The Companys effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the US and Ireland The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the US Internal Revenue Service the IRS and other tax authorities and governmental bodies The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations If the Companys effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the US or Ireland or if the ultimate determination of the Companys taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the Companys financial condition operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 16

primarily in the US Additionally the Company owned a total of 4928 acres of land primarily in the US As of September 30 2017 the Company owned facilities and land for corporate functions RD and data centers at various locations throughout the US Outside the US the Company owned additional facilities and land for various purposes The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment which are used by all operating segments are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors and continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products Item 3 Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business In the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims However the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty Therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected See the risk factor The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in Part I Item 1A

first quarter of 2018 to be between 380 and 385 The foregoing statement regarding the Companys expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2018 is forwardlooking and could differ from actual results The Companys future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including but not limited to those set forth in Part I Item 1A of this Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors and those described in this paragraph In general the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industrywide global product pricing pressures increased competition compressed product life cycles product transitions potential increases in the cost of components and potential strengthening of the US dollar as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Companys sales mix towards products with lower gross margins In response to competitive pressures the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions which would adversely affect gross margins Gross margins could also be affected by the Companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products Due to the Companys significant international operations its financial condition and operating results including gross margins could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2017 2016 and 2015 were as follows dollars in millions 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015 Research

and material costs to support expanded RD activities The Company continues to believe that focused investments in RD are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Companys core business strategy Selling General and Administrative The yearoveryear growth in selling general and administrative expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcountrelated expenses variable selling expenses and infrastructurerelated costs The decrease in selling general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower discretionary expenditures and advertising costs partially offset by an increase in headcountrelated expenses

tax rates for 2017 2016 and 2015 were as follows dollars in millions 2017 2016 2015 Provision for income taxes 15738 15685 19121 Effective tax rate 246 256 264 The Companys effective tax rates for 2017 2016 and 2015 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland for which no US taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the US The lower effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a different geographic mix of earnings and higher US RD tax credits The lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to greater RD tax credits As of September 30 2017 the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences tax losses and tax credits of 39 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 315 billion Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance The IRS concluded its review of the years 2010 through 2012 during the third quarter of 2017 All years prior to 2013 are closed and the IRS is currently examining the years 2013 through 2015 The Company is also subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities In major states and major foreign jurisdictions the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations However the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs On August 30 2016 the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company the State Aid Decision The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014 Irish legislative changes effective as of January 2015 eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision Although Ireland is still computing the recovery amount the Company expects the amount to be in line with the European Commissions announced recovery amount of 13 billion plus interest of 1 billion Once the recovery amount is finalized by Ireland the Company anticipates funding it including interest out of foreign cash These amounts are expected to be placed into escrow in 2018 where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against US taxes

September 30 2017 the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were 95 billion The Companys retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Companys products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company which typically covers periods up to 150 days The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers As of September 30 2017 the Company expects to pay 376 billion under manufacturingrelated supplier arrangements substantially all of which is noncancelable Other Purchase Obligations The Companys other purchase obligations consisted of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and noncancelable obligations related to advertising licensing RD internet and telecommunications services and other obligations As of September 30 2017 the Company had other purchase obligations of 61 billion The Companys other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties As of September 30 2017 the Company had deferred tax liabilities of 315 billion gross unrecognized tax benefits of 84 billion and an additional 12 billion for gross interest and penalties At this time the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table Indemnification Agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party In the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to indemnification of third parties The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the US the UK and mainland China The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone provided certain conditions are met The Company accounts for the tradein right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers Under these agreements the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 32 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Companys management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation and impairment of marketable securities inventory valuation valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications accessories and service and support contracts The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred For most of the Companys product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped For online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the US and for certain other sales the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit For payment terms in excess of the Companys standard payment terms revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable such as a successful history of collection without concession on comparable arrangements The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industryspecific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware For multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software andor undelivered nonsoftware services the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices In such circumstances the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value VSOE ii thirdparty evidence of selling price TPE and iii best estimate of selling price ESP VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable ESPs reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis For sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices Mac Apple Watch and Apple TV the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the devices essential software andor nonsoftware services free of charge Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the nonsoftware services revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Companys ESPs Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services based on the Companys ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided The Companys process for determining ESPs involves managements judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable Should future facts and circumstances change the Companys ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and nonsoftware services related to future sales of these devices could change Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services offered the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 33 The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs For transactions involving price protection the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met The Companys policy requires that if refunds cannot be reliably estimated revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses For the Companys other customer incentive programs the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue Additionally certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive Managements estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would have an adverse impact on the Companys operating results Valuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities The Companys investments in availableforsale securities are reported at fair value Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets Changes in the fair value of availableforsale securities impact the Companys net income only when such securities are sold or an otherthantemporary impairment is recognized Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each securitys cost basis The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is otherthantemporarily impaired which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made In making this determination the Company evaluates among other things the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto and the Companys intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis The Companys assessment of whether a security is otherthantemporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security which would have an adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Inventory Valuation Valuation of ManufacturingRelated Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturingrelated assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities In addition the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components The Company records a writedown for inventories of components and products including thirdparty products held for resale which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value The Company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels and component cost trends The Company also reviews its manufacturingrelated capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional writedowns of inventory andor impairments of manufacturingrelated assets or inventory prepayments These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Companys products being less favorable than forecasted unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Companys product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Companys suppliers that hold any of the Companys manufacturingrelated assets or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment Such writedowns would adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results in the period when the additional writedowns were recorded The Company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Companys products a change in the Companys product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees were identified and recorded Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 34 Warranty Costs The Company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Companys typical experience The Company regularly reviews these estimates and the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection to assess the appropriateness of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities could be required and could materially affect the Companys financial condition and operating results Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to fully recover the Companys deferred tax assets In the event that the Company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made In addition the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I Item 3 of this Form 10K under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment In the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims However the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty Therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 35 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures Given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates Further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results Interest Rate Risk The Companys exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio and outstanding debt While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the Companys interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in US interest rates Changes in US interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Companys debt The Companys investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Companys liquidity requirements The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives The Company typically invests in highlyrated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve Based on investment positions as of September 30 2017 and September 24 2016 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 60 billion and 49 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity As of September 30 2017 and September 24 2016 the Company had outstanding floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 1037 billion and 789 billion respectively The Company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Companys debt as of September 30 2017 and September 24 2016 to increase by 376 million and 271 million on an annualized basis respectively Further details regarding the Companys debt is provided in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6 Debt Foreign Currency Risk In general the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the US dollar Accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the US dollar will negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in US dollars There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries In addition the Company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreigndenominated debt issuances The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months However the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 36 To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Companys foreign currency derivative positions the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk VAR model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the Companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool Forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model Based on the results of the model the Company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 485 million as of September 30 2017 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 434 million as of September 24 2016 Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures Actual future gains and losses associated with the Companys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 30 2017 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the Companys actual exposures and positions Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 37 Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Index to Consolidated

preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes Actual results could differ materially from those estimates Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53week period that ends on the last Saturday of September The Companys fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks and ended on September 30 2017 A 14th week was included in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 as is done every five or six years to realign the Companys fiscal quarters with

quarters months and periods refer to the Companys fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters months and periods of those fiscal years Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software digital content and applications accessories and service and support contracts The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred For most of the Companys product sales these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped For online sales to individuals for some sales to education customers in the US and for certain other sales the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit For payment terms in excess of the Companys standard payment terms revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable such as a successful history of collection without concession on comparable arrangements The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and thirdparty digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industryspecific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware For the sale of most thirdparty products the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own pricing for such products retains related inventory risk for physical products is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers For thirdparty applications sold through the App Store and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store the Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the primary obligor to the customer Therefore the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from each sale The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to thirdparty app developers and certain digital content owners is not reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 44 The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the delivery of products or the performance of services This includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and nonsoftware services that are attached to hardware and software products The Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores and also sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store App Store Mac App Store TV App Store and iBooks Store for the purchase of digital content and software The Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card which is relieved upon redemption of the card by the customer Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone support repair services webbased support resources and diagnostic tools offered under the Companys standard limited warranty The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs For transactions involving price protection the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded For the Companys other customer incentive programs the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Companys historical experience Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables For multielement arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products functionality undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware products essential software and undelivered nonsoftware services the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices In such circumstances the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value VSOE ii thirdparty evidence of selling price TPE and iii best estimate of selling price ESP VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable ESPs reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis For multielement arrangements accounted for in accordance with industryspecific software accounting guidance the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element and if VSOE does not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone iPad iPod touch Mac Apple Watch and Apple TV the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the devices essential software andor nonsoftware services free of charge The Company has identified up to three deliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of these devices The first deliverable which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale The second deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the products essential software The third deliverable is the nonsoftware services to be provided to qualifying devices The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price method Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables the allocation of revenue is based on the Companys ESPs Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the nonsoftware services is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related essential software including estimated warranty costs are recognized at the time of sale Costs incurred to provide nonsoftware services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred and engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses as incurred The Companys process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable including where applicable prices charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings productspecific business objectives estimated cost to provide the nonsoftware services and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and nonsoftware services as compared to the total selling price of the product Shipping Costs Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue and the Companys shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of sales Warranty Costs The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized The Company assesses the adequacy of its accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 45 Software Development Costs Research and development RD costs are expensed as incurred Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers In most instances the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established and as a result software development costs were expensed as incurred Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling general and administrative expenses Sharebased Compensation The Company recognizes expense related to sharebased payment transactions in which it receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the Company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the Companys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments Sharebased compensation expense for restricted stock units RSUs and restricted stock is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant The Company estimates forfeitures expected to occur and recognizes sharebased compensation expense for those equity awards expected to vest The Company recognizes sharebased compensation expense over the awards requisite service period on a straightline basis for timebased RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on the achievement of performance conditions The Company recognizes a benefit from sharebased compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity if an excess tax benefit is realized In addition the Company recognizes the indirect effects of sharebased compensation on RD tax credits foreign tax credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations Further information regarding sharebased compensation can be found in Note 9 Benefit Plans Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement See Note 5 Income Taxes for additional information Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued Potentially dilutive securities include unvested RSUs unvested restricted stock outstanding stock options and shares to be purchased by employees under the Companys employee stock purchase plan The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method Under the treasury stock method an increase in the fair market value of the Companys common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 46 The following table shows the computation of

share 921 831 922 Potentially dilutive securities whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share Financial Instruments Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents The Companys marketable debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as availableforsale Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each balance sheet date The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either shortterm or longterm based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as shortterm and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12 months are classified as longterm Marketable equity securities including mutual funds are classified as either shortterm or longterm based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations The Companys marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss AOCI in shareholders equity with the exception of unrealized losses believed to be otherthantemporary which are reported in earnings in the current period The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method Derivative Financial Instruments The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carries them at fair value For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument if any is recognized in earnings in the current period To receive hedge accounting treatment cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions For options designated as cash flow hedges changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges both the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period For derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of the net investment in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment hedge the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness Accordingly any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the current period Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the current period Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 47 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its assessment of various factors including historical experience age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality of the Companys customers current economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers abilities to pay Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost computed using the firstin firstout method and net realizable value Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period Property Plant and Equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at cost Depreciation is computed by use of the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building between one and five years for machinery and equipment including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements The Company capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internaluse software that are incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage Capitalized costs related to internaluse software are amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from three to five years Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was 82 billion 83 billion and 92 billion during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively LongLived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets The Company reviews property plant and equipment inventory component prepayments and identifiable intangibles excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment Longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate If property plant and equipment inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired The Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during 2017 2016 and 2015 For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment the Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure Goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit In 2017 and 2016 the Companys goodwill was primarily allocated to the Americas and Europe reporting units The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment The Company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years Fair Value Measurements The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the marketbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities Level 3 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 48 The Companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Companys debt instruments and all other financial instruments all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings were valued based on quoted market prices or modeldriven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its nonUS dollar functional currency subsidiaries into US dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation included in AOCI in shareholders equity The Companys subsidiaries that use the US dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period and inventories property and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates Note 2 Financial

maturities for strategic reasons including but not limited to anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management The maturities of the Companys longterm marketable securities generally range from one to five years The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature The Company typically invests in highlyrated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio When evaluating an investment for otherthantemporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto changes in market interest rates and the Companys intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investments cost basis As of September 30 2017 the Company does not consider any of its investments to be otherthantemporarily impaired Derivative Financial Instruments The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities However the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates certain of the Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the US dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the US dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies The Company may enter into forward contracts option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates In addition the Company may use nonderivative financial instruments such as its foreign currencydenominated debt as economic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries In both of these cases the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 50 The Company may also enter into nondesignated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies The Company may enter into interest rate swaps options or other instruments to manage interest rate risk These instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense or changes in fair value of the Companys term debt or investments The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges The Companys hedged interest rate transactions as of September 30 2017 are expected to be recognized within 10 years The Company may enter into foreign currency swaps to manage currency risk on its foreign currencydenominated term debt These instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on the Companys term debt and related interest payments The Company designates these instruments as cash flow hedges The Companys hedged term debtrelated foreign currency transactions as of September 30 2017 are expected to be recognized within 25 years Cash Flow Hedges The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in other incomeexpense net in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other incomeexpense net Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be dedesignated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent twomonth time period Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into other incomeexpense net in the period of dedesignation Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other incomeexpense net unless they are redesignated as hedges of other transactions Net Investment Hedges The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive incomeloss OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other incomeexpense net Fair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item NonDesignated Derivatives Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the derivative relates As a result the Company recognized a gain of 20 million in net sales a loss of 40 million in cost of sales and a gain of 606 million in other incomeexpense net for 2017 The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value The Companys accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on its hedge

transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss The credit risk amounts represent the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract based on thencurrent currency or interest rates at each respective date The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Companys derivative instruments it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty To further limit credit risk the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets The net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was 35 million and 163 million as of September 30 2017 and September 24 2016 respectively which were recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Companys derivative contracts the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other As of September 30 2017 and September 24 2016 the potential effects of these rights of setoff associated with the Companys derivative contracts including the effects of collateral would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of 14 billion and 15 billion respectively resulting in net derivative assets of 32 million and 160 million respectively Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers valueadded resellers small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers however the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk In addition when possible the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring thirdparty financing loans or leases to support credit exposure These creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the thirdparty financing company and the end customer As such the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements As of September 30 2017 the Company had two customers that individually represented 10 or more of total trade receivables each of which accounted for 10 As of September 24 2016 the Company had one customer that represented 10 or more of total trade receivables which

taxation and files income tax returns in the US federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions The US Internal Revenue Service the IRS concluded its review of the years 2010 through 2012 during the third quarter of 2017 All years prior to 2013 are closed and the IRS is currently examining the years 2013 through 2015 The Company is also subject to audits by state local and foreign tax authorities In major states and major foreign jurisdictions the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations However the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty If any issues addressed in the Companys tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with its expectations the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs Although timing of the resolution andor closure of audits is not certain the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next 12 months On August 30 2016 the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company the State Aid Decision The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014 Irish legislative changes effective as of January 2015 eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision Although Ireland is still computing the recovery amount the Company expects the amount to be in line with the European Commissions announced recovery amount of 13 billion plus interest of 1 billion Once the recovery amount is finalized by Ireland the Company anticipates funding it including interest out of foreign cash These amounts are expected to be placed into escrow in 2018 where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against US taxes Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 57 Note 6 Debt

as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was 61 billion 51 billion and 48 billion for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively The majority of RSUs that vested in 2017 2016 and 2015 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities The total shares withheld were approximately 154 million 159 million and 141 million for 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Companys closing stock price Total payments for the employees tax obligations to taxing authorities were 20 billion 17 billion and 16 billion in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows These net share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company Sharebased Compensation The following table shows a summary of the sharebased compensation expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2017 2016 and 2015 in millions 2017 2016 2015 Cost of sales 877 769 575 Research and development 2299 1889

which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party In the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to indemnification of third parties The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the US the UK and mainland China The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone provided certain conditions are met The Company accounts for the tradein right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers Under these agreements the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources a few components are currently obtained from single or limited sources In addition the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers Therefore many components used by the Company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia with some Mac computers manufactured in the US and Ireland A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations Certain of these outsourcing partners are the solesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the Companys operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments The Companys manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days Other OffBalance Sheet Commitments Operating Leases The Company leases various equipment and facilities including retail space under noncancelable operating lease arrangements The Company does not currently utilize any other offbalance sheet financing arrangements As of September 30 2017 the Companys total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were 95 billion The Companys retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options Apple Inc 2017 Form 10K 65 Rent expense under all operating leases including both cancelable and noncancelable leases was 11 billion 939 million and 794 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 30 2017 are as follows in millions 2018 1223 2019 1187 2020 1108 2021 1033 2022 871 Thereafter 4123 Total 9545 Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain offbalance sheet arrangements which require the future purchase of goods or services Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Companys Unconditional Purchase Obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements internet and telecommunication services and intellectual property licenses Future payments under noncancelable Unconditional Purchase Obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 30 2017 are as follows in millions 2018 1798 2019 2675 2020 1626 2021 1296 2022 1268 Thereafter 14 Total 8677 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated as further discussed in Part I Item 1A of this Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors and in Part I Item 3 of this Form 10K under the heading Legal Proceedings In the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims However the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain Therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Apple Inc v Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al On August 24 2012 a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company 105 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States District Court Northern District of California San Jose Division On March 6 2014 the District Court entered final judgment in favor of the Company in the amount of approximately 930 million On May 18 2015 the US

effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the
