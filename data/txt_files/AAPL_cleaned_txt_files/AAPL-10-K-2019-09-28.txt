service and Apple Pay a cashless payment service Markets and Distribution The Companys customers are primarily in the consumer small and midsized business education enterprise and government markets The Company sells its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels such as thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers During 2019 the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 31 and 69 respectively of total net sales No single customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales in 2019 2018 and 2017 Competition The markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices Many of the Companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price product and service features including security features relative price and performance product and service quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices These markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors imitate features of the Companys products and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer These markets are characterized by aggressive price competition frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses The Companys services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including hardware software and services Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 2 Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones personal computers tablets and other electronic devices Therefore many components used by the Company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia with some Mac computers manufactured in the US and Ireland Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development RD licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services This includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the US and various foreign countries Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world Over time the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products In addition to Companyowned intellectual property many of the Companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Companys products processes and services While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses The timing of product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction Employees As of September 28 2019 the Company had approximately 137000 fulltime equivalent employees Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 3 Available Information The Companys

important to understanding other statements in this Form 10K The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10K The business financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the Companys actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results Any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the Companys business financial condition operating results and stock price Because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the Companys financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations financial condition and growth The Company has international operations with sales outside the US representing a majority of the Companys total net sales In addition a majority of the Companys supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the US As a result the Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions Adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Companys products and services In addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Companys products uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Companys suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners Potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Companys products and insolvency A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Companys trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the Companys ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the Companys financial instruments These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations financial condition and growth Global markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets The Companys products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses The Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services As a result the Company must make significant investments in RD There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully The Company currently holds a significant number of patents trademarks and copyrights and has registered and applied to register numerous patents trademarks and copyrights In contrast many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Companys intellectual property the Companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 5 The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships In addition some of the Companys competitors have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins Certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss Additionally the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Companys product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted In addition an increasing number of Internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Companys existing products The Companys services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications The Companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Companys ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes the Company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies Accordingly the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions The Company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers The Company also sells its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales The financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the Companys products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 6 The Company is exposed to the risk of writedowns on the value of its inventory and other assets in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk The Company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components The Company reviews longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value Although the Company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur writedowns fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days Because the Companys markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments Future operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks Many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the Companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Companys suppliers described in Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations financial condition and growth above also could affect the Companys ability to obtain components Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results The Companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all can be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the US Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management While these arrangements can lower operating costs they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services or the Companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and outofwarranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur The Company relies on singlesource outsourcing partners in the US Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia for final assembly of substantially all of the Companys hardware products Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Companys cost or supply of components or finished goods In addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 7 The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted The Companys products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Companys business and result in harm to the Companys reputation The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects Sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the Company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties Component defects could make the Companys products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury These risks may increase as the Companys products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare In addition the Companys service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors As a result the Companys services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Companys products and services In addition the Company can be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications writeoffs of inventory property plant and equipment andor intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Companys products and services and result in harm to the Companys reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales The Company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers This includes the right to sell currently available content The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms if at all Some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future Other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the Companys access to or increase the cost of such content The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach Failure to obtain the right to make thirdparty digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Some thirdparty digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions If requirements change the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner In addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Companys content providers The Companys future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services There is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Companys products If thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Companys products customers may choose not to buy the Companys products The Company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Companys products compared to competitors platforms such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 8 The Companys minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors products with larger market share If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the Companys devices may suffer The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products The Companys products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers The Company sells and delivers thirdparty applications for its products through the App Store Mac App Store TV App Store and Watch App Store The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer inapp purchases to customers then the volume of sales and the commission that the Company earns on those sales would decrease The Company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all Many of the Companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties which requires licenses from those third parties In addition because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents the Companys products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others From time to time the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties Based on experience and industry practice the Company believes licenses to such thirdparty intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms There is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all Failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future In addition agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase In particular the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellularenabled products and new claims may arise in the future For example technology and other patentholding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several US jurisdictions as well as internationally in various countries The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages Regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation can be expensive timeconsuming disruptive to the Companys operations and distracting to management In recognition of these considerations the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur These agreements may also significantly increase the Companys cost of sales and operating expenses Except as described in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies under the heading Contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above managements expectations the Companys financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 9 The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide which exposes the Company to potential liabilities increased costs and other adverse effects on the Companys business The Companys global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including but not limited to antitrust privacy data security and data localization consumer protection advertising sales billing and ecommerce product liability intellectual property ownership and infringement digital platforms Internet telecommunications and mobile communications media television film and digital content availability of thirdparty software applications and services labor and employment anticorruption import export and trade foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions antimoney laundering foreign ownership and investment tax and environmental health and safety Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive increasing the cost of conducting the Companys global operations Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Companys business by increasing the Companys costs limiting the Companys ability to offer a product or service to customers requiring changes to the Companys business practices or otherwise making the Companys products and services less attractive to customers The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the Companys employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Companys policies and procedures If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations it could materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results The technology industry including in some instances the Company is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which exposes the Company to government investigations legal actions and penalties For example the Company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results There can be no assurance that the Companys business will not be materially adversely affected individually or in the aggregate by the outcomes of such investigations or changes to laws and regulations in the future The Companys retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties The Companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness Because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores Due to the high cost structure associated with the Companys retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs The Companys retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Companys financial condition and operating results including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity Other factors include but are not limited to the Companys ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Companys ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated The Company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greaterthanexpected liabilities and expenses inadequate return on capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful The Companys business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions The Company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the Companys business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Companys business by among other things preventing access to the Companys online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Companys products These events could materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 10 There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the Company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences The Companys business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information PII with respect to the Companys customers and employees The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data But these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results The Companys business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results For example the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Companys information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information Such an incident could among other things impair the Companys ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the Companys stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the Company Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including PII affect many companies across various industries the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies As with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities For example third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the Companys information technology systems To help protect customers and the Company the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Companys products and services In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data Health data is subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Companys compliance with these obligations If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Companys agreements with healthcare institutions the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines Under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise The Companys business is subject to a variety of US and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection The Company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of PII In many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others In addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 11 The Companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel Much of the Companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its Chief Executive Officer executive team and other highly skilled employees Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in Silicon Valley where most of the Companys key personnel are located The Companys business can be impacted by political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions Political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners International trade disputes can result in tariffs and other measures that can adversely affect the Companys business For example trade tensions have led to a series of tariffs imposed by the US on imports from China Tariffs increase the cost of the Companys products and the components and raw materials that go into making them These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products Tariffs can also make the Companys products more expensive for customers which could make the Companys products less competitive and reduce consumer demand Countries may also adopt other measures that could limit the Companys ability to offer its products and services Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the Companys business Many of the Companys operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Companys suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters In addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond the Companys control Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the Companys service offerings Following an interruption to its business the Company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company The Companys operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers While the Companys suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Companys business and harm to the Companys reputation Should major public health issues including pandemics arise the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Companys suppliers and contract manufacturers While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise The Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate The Companys profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels For example gross margins on the Companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time The Companys gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industrywide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures increased competition the Companys ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services compressed product life cycles potential increases in the cost of components outside manufacturing services and acquiring and delivering content for the Companys services the Companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively shifts in the mix of products and services or in the geographic currency or channel mix fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the introduction of new products or services including new products or services with higher cost structures These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 12 The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses Further the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lowerthananticipated demand for the Companys products or services issues with new product or service introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the Companys logistics components supply or manufacturing partners The Companys stock price is subject to volatility The Companys stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future Additionally the Company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Companys Board of Directors and the Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention The Companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the US dollar relative to local currencies The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonUS dollardenominated sales cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide Gross margins on the Companys products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar adversely affects the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the Companys products In some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the US dollars strengthening which would adversely affect the US dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currencydenominated sales Conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar while generally beneficial to the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit Additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins The Company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio The Companys investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results market and economic conditions political risk sovereign risk interest rate fluctuations or other factors As a result the value and liquidity of the Companys cash cash equivalents and marketable and nonmarketable securities may fluctuate substantially Therefore although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable and nonmarketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 13 The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen The Company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers The Company also sells its products directly to small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance The Companys exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited The Company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company In addition the Company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components As of September 28 2019 a significant portion of the Companys trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities The Company is subject to taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions including Ireland where a number of the Companys subsidiaries are organized Due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change The Companys effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the US and Ireland The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the US Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations If the Companys effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the US or Ireland or if the ultimate determination of the Companys taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties The Companys headquarters are located in Cupertino California As of September 28 2019 the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate functions RD data centers retail and other purposes at locations throughout the US and in various places outside the US The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment which are used by all reportable segments are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business Item 3 Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business Except as described in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies under the heading Contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above managements expectations the Companys financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Refer to the risk factor The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights in Part I Item 1A of this Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2019 that did not individually or in the aggregate

minimum tax on certain foreign earnings The Companys effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from sharebased compensation The Companys effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 2018 blended US tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act The Companys effective tax rate for 2019 was lower compared to 2018 due primarily to a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019 and the impact of the Act in 2018 partially offset by higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2019 As of September 28 2019 the Company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax credits of 143 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 62 billion Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets The Company will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance if any by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets Recent Accounting Pronouncements Hedging In August 2017 the Financial

Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 28 2019 a significant portion of the other noncurrent liabilities in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act Other NonCurrent Liabilities The Companys remaining other noncurrent liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Companys management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material Management believes the Companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition valuation of manufacturingrelated assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees warranty costs income taxes and legal and other contingencies Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and operating results and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters The Companys senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors Revenue Recognition The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone Mac iPad and certain other products The first performance obligation which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain productrelated bundled services which include iCloud Siri and Maps The third performance obligation is the right to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices SSPs Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the Companys estimated SSPs Revenue allocated to the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided The Companys process for determining estimated SSPs involves managements judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable Should future facts and circumstances change the Companys SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change Factors subject to change include the nature of the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 25 Valuation of ManufacturingRelated Assets and Estimation of Inventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees The Company invests in manufacturingrelated assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm agreements to secure the supply of inventory The Company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled The Companys estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are the key inputs in the determination of the recoverability of manufacturingrelated assets and the assessment of the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the Companys products a change in the Companys product development plans or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Companys products the Company may be required to record writedowns or impairments of manufacturingrelated assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees Warranty Costs The Company offers limited warranties on its new hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products and customers may purchase extended service coverage where available on many of the Companys hardware products The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the Companys typical experience The Company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required Income Taxes The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greaterthan50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I Item 3 of this Form 10K under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the determination of which requires significant judgment Except as described in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies under the heading Contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above managements expectations the Companys financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps both on a standalone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures Given the effective horizons of the Companys risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates Further the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and therefore may adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results Interest Rate Risk The Companys exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio and outstanding debt While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations the Companys interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in US interest rates Changes in US interest rates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Companys debt Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 26 The Companys investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Companys liquidity requirements The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives The Company typically invests in highly rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss The Companys investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investment portfolio the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve Based on investment positions as of September 28 2019 and September 29 2018 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a 28 billion and 49 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity As of September 28 2019 and September 29 2018 the Company had outstanding floating and fixedrate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of 1021 billion and 1025 billion respectively The Company has entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixedrate payments into floatingrate payments or floatingrate payments into fixedrate payments Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Companys debt as of September 28 2019 and September 29 2018 to increase by 325 million and 399 million on an annualized basis respectively Foreign Currency Risk In general the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the US dollar Accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the US dollar will negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in US dollars There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities certain firmly committed transactions forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries In addition the Company has entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currencydenominated debt issuances The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months However the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures To provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Companys foreign currency derivative positions the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a valueatrisk VAR model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the Companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool Forecasted transactions firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model Based on the results of the model the Company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 452 million as of September 28 2019 compared to a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 592 million as of September 29 2018 Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures Actual future gains and losses associated with the Companys investment portfolio debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 28 2019 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and the Companys actual exposures and positions Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 27 Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Page Consolidated Statements of

buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building between one and five years for machinery and equipment including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements Capitalized costs related to internaluse software are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from three to five years Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was 113 billion 93 billion and 82 billion during 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively Noncash investing activities involving property plant and equipment resulted in a net increasedecrease to accounts payable and other current liabilities of 29 billion and 34 billion during 2019 and 2018 respectively Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 35 NonMarketable Securities The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity securities without readily determinable fair values As such the Companys nonmarketable equity securities are measured at cost less any impairment and are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer Gains and losses on nonmarketable equity securities are recognized in OIE Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted The Company records restricted cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and determines current or noncurrent classification based on the expected duration of the restriction The Company records restricted marketable securities as current or noncurrent marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities Fair Value Measurements The fair values of the Companys money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Companys debt instruments and all other financial instruments which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings are based on quoted market prices or modeldriven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data Note 2 Revenue Recognition Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone Mac iPad Services and other products The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers For most of the Companys Products net sales control transfers when products are shipped For the Companys Services net sales control transfers over time as services are delivered Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services as applicable The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Companys expectations and historical experience For arrangements with multiple performance obligations which represent promises within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices SSPs When available the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs When observable prices are not available SSPs are established that reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis The Companys process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including where applicable prices charged by the Company for similar offerings market trends in the pricing for similar offerings productspecific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone Mac iPad and certain other products The first performance obligation which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain productrelated bundled services which include iCloud Siri and Maps The third performance obligation is the right to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the Companys estimated SSPs Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer which generally occurs when the product is shipped Revenue allocated to the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software including estimated warranty costs are recognized at the time of sale Costs incurred to provide productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred For certain longterm service arrangements the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered For these arrangements the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services Accordingly the Company has not recognized revenue and has elected not to disclose amounts related to these undelivered services Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 36 For the sale of thirdparty products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of thirdparty products including but not limited to evaluating if it can establish the price of the product retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product For thirdparty applications sold through the App Store Mac App Store TV App Store and Watch App Store and certain digital content sold through the Companys other digital content stores the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer Therefore the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities with the collected taxes recorded within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority Deferred Revenue As of September 28 2019 and September 29 2018 the Company had total deferred revenue of 81 billion

Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and certain existing assets and liabilities However the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including but not limited to accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates certain of the Companys subsidiaries whose functional currency is the US dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue and subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the US dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries functional currencies The Company may enter into forward contracts option contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases typically for up to 12 months Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 39 To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates In addition the Company may use nonderivative financial instruments such as its foreign currencydenominated debt as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries In both of these cases the Company designates these instruments as net investment hedges To protect the Companys foreign currencydenominated term

portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses or changes in fair value The Company may designate these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges As of September 28 2019 the Companys hedged term debt and marketable securitiesrelated foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized within 23 years The Company may also enter into nondesignated foreign currency contracts to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies To protect the Companys foreign currencydenominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates the Company may enter into interest rate swaps options or other instruments These instruments may offset a portion of the changes in interest income or expense or changes in fair value The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges As of September 28 2019 the Companys hedged interest rate transactions are expected to be recognized within 8 years Cash Flow Hedges The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are recognized in OIE in the same period as the related income or expense is recognized For options designated as cash flow hedges changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in OIE Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be dedesignated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within a subsequent twomonth time period Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified into OIE in the period of dedesignation Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in OIE unless they are redesignated as hedges of other transactions Net Investment Hedges The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in OIE For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges the Company excludes changes in fair value

current period Fair Value Hedges Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness The amount excluded from the effectiveness testing of fair value hedges was a gain of 777 million for 2019

measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit or market loss The credit risk amounts represent the Companys gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract based on thencurrent currency or interest rates at each respective date The Companys exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Companys derivative instruments it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments Apple Inc 2019 Form 10K 42 The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty To further limit credit risk the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets As of September 28 2019 the net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was 16 billion which was recorded as other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet As of September 29 2018 the net cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements was 10 billion which was recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Companys derivative contracts the Company is allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other As of September 28 2019 and September 29 2018 the potential effects of these rights of setoff associated with the Companys derivative contracts including the effects of collateral would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of 27 billion and 21

the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring thirdparty financing loans or leases to support credit exposure These creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the thirdparty financing company and the end customer As such the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements As of September 28 2019 the Company had no customers that individually represented 10 or more of total trade receivables As of September 29 2018 the Company had one customer that

and Chief Financial Officer does not expect that the Companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud A control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide
