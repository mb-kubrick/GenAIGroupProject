Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific Americas includes both North and South America Europe includes European countries as well as India the Middle East and Africa Greater China includes China mainland Hong Kong and Taiwan Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Companys other reportable segments Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Companys customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region Markets and Distribution The Companys customers are primarily in the consumer small and midsized business education enterprise and government markets The Company sells its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels such as thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers During 2023 the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37 and 63 respectively of total net sales Competition The markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses Many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by imitating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 2 The Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price product and service features including security features relative price and performance product and service quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones personal computers tablets wearables and accessories and services The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and service offerings with large customer bases In addition some of the Companys competitors have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins Certain competitors have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss The Companys services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Companys product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones personal computers tablets wearables and accessories Therefore many components used by the Company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development RD licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services This includes patents designs copyrights trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the US and various foreign countries Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel The Company regularly files patent design copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research development design and marketing and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world Over time the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products and services The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services In addition to Companyowned intellectual property many of the Companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Companys products processes and services While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses The timing of product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction Human Capital The Company believes it has a talented motivated and dedicated team and works to create an inclusive safe and supportive environment for all of its team members As of September 30 2023 the Company had approximately 161000 fulltime equivalent employees Workplace Practices and Policies The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free

of factors whether currently known or unknown including those described below When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time the Companys business reputation results of operations financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected Because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the Companys results of operations and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods This discussion of risk factors contains forwardlooking statements This section should be read in conjunction with Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10K Macroeconomic and Industry Risks The Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations and financial condition The Company has international operations with sales outside the US representing a majority of the Companys total net sales In addition the Companys global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Companys supplier facilities including manufacturing and assembly sites are located outside the US As a result the Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions Adverse macroeconomic conditions including slow growth or recession high unemployment inflation tighter credit higher interest rates and currency fluctuations can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Companys products and services In addition consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy financial market volatility declines in income or asset values and other economic factors In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Companys products and services uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Companys suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners and developers Potential outcomes include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance business operations and insolvency Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Companys trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the Companys ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair values of the Companys financial instruments These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations financial condition and stock price The Companys business can be impacted by political events trade and other international disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions Political events trade and other international disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 5 The Company has a large global business with sales outside the US representing a majority of the Companys total net sales and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland India Japan South Korea Taiwan and Vietnam Restrictions on international trade such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods technology or data can materially adversely affect the Companys operations and supply chain and limit the Companys ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues andor has significant supply chain operations Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions including changing suppliers restructuring business relationships and ceasing to offer thirdparty applications on its platforms Changing the Companys operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive timeconsuming and disruptive to the Companys operations Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures For example tensions between governments including the US and China have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Companys business If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Companys business Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the Companys business Many of the Companys operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Companys suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters In addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks labor disputes public health issues including pandemics such as the COVID19 pandemic and other events beyond the Companys control Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters such as droughts floods hurricanes and wildfires occurring more frequently or with more intense effects Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the Companys service offerings and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas Following an interruption to its business the Company can require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures to resume operations and lose significant sales Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company The Companys operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers While the Companys suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life disruption to the Companys business and harm to the Companys reputation Major public health issues including pandemics such as the COVID19 pandemic have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely affect the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products the imposition of protective public safety measures such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions and disruptions in the Companys operations supply chain and sales and distribution channels resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise Global markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets The Companys products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses The Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services As a result the Company must make significant investments in RD There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 6 The Company currently holds a significant number of patents trademarks and copyrights and has registered and applied to register additional patents trademarks and copyrights In contrast many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and by imitating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Companys intellectual property the Companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships In addition some of the Companys competitors have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins Certain competitors have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall Additionally the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Companys product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions The Companys services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications The Companys business results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Companys ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes the Company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including timely and successful development market acceptance the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production rampup issues the availability of application software for the Companys products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the US Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland India Japan South Korea Taiwan and Vietnam and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations Changes or additions to the Companys supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management While these arrangements can lower operating costs they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided or adversely affect the Companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and outofwarranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations and financial condition Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 7 The Company relies on singlesource outsourcing partners in the US Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia for final assembly of substantially all of the Companys hardware products Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Companys cost or supply of components or finished goods In addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes armed conflict economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted Future operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks Many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations and financial condition For example the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply which adversely affected the Companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all Such disruptions could occur in the future While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the Companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Companys suppliers described in The Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations and financial condition above can also affect the Companys ability to obtain components Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition The Companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all can be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements When the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys business results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations and financial condition The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source The Companys products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Companys business and result in harm to the Companys reputation The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects Sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the Company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties Component defects could make the Companys products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury These risks may increase as the Companys products are introduced into specialized applications including health In addition the Companys service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors As a result from time to time the Companys services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Companys products and services In addition the Company can be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications writeoffs of inventory property plant and equipment or intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Companys products and services and result in harm to the Companys reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 8 The Company is exposed to the risk of writedowns on the value of its inventory and other assets in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk The Company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components The Company reviews longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value Although the Company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable there can be no assurance the Company will not incur writedowns fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days Because the Companys markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments The Company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all The Companys products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties which requires licenses from those third parties In addition because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents the Companys products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others From time to time the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties Based on experience and industry practice the Company believes licenses to such thirdparty intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms However there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all Failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Companys business results of operations and financial condition The Companys future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services There can be no assurance thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Companys products If thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Companys products customers may choose not to buy the Companys products The Company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Companys products compared to competitors platforms such as Android for smartphones and tablets Windows for personal computers and tablets and PlayStation Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services The Companys minority market share in the global smartphone personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors products with larger market share When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the Companys devices can suffer The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products The Companys products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and when thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Companys products Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 9 The Company distributes thirdparty applications for its products through the App Store For the vast majority of applications developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application From time to time the Company has made changes to its App Store including actions taken in response to competition market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements The Company expects to make further business changes in the future including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store such as the European Union EU Digital Markets Act which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024 The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store which have resulted in changes to the Companys business practices and may in the future result in further changes Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms This could reduce the volume of sales and the commission that the Company earns on those sales would decrease If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated the Companys business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Companys customers or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business results of operations and financial condition The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers This includes the right to sell or offer subscriptions to thirdparty content as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Companys own services The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all Some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content Other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the Companys access to or increase the cost of such content The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules The Company also produces its own digital content which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent content and subscribers and may fail to appeal to the Companys customers Some thirdparty digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions If requirements change the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner The Companys success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees including key personnel and the Companys ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture Much of the Companys future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel including its Chief Executive Officer executive team and other highly skilled employees Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in Silicon Valley where most of the Companys key personnel are located In addition to intense competition for talent workforce dynamics are constantly evolving If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively it could materially adversely affect the Companys culture reputation and operational flexibility The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success If the Company is unable to nurture its culture it could materially adversely affect the Companys ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations and financial condition The Company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of which distribute products and services from competitors The Company also sells its products and services and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Companys products offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 10 The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales The financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the Companys products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products The Companys business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents or other events or disruptions System upgrades redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the Companys or its vendors business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Companys business by among other things preventing access to the Companys online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Companys products These events could materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations and financial condition Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personal information could subject the Company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences The Companys business requires it to use and store confidential information including personal information with respect to the Companys customers and employees The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data But these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations and financial condition The Companys business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Companys behalf such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations and financial condition The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations and can among other things impair the Companys ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the Companys stock price materially damage commercial relationships and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the Company Globally attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls avoid detection and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence all of which hinders the Companys ability to identify investigate and recover from incidents In addition attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including personal information affect many companies across various industries the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies As with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking ransomware attacks employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities For example third parties can fraudulently induce the Companys or its vendors employees or customers into disclosing usernames passwords or other sensitive information which can in turn be used for unauthorized access to the Companys or its vendors systems and services To help protect customers and the Company the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Companys products and services While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 11 Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Companys ongoing business present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations and financial condition The Company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greaterthanexpected liabilities and expenses economic political legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses regions or countries inadequate return on capital potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and significant writeoffs Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Companys ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations and financial condition The Companys retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties The Companys retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Companys business results of operations and financial condition including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity Other factors include the Companys ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks The Companys business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations The Company is subject to various claims legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new matters may arise in the future In addition agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party The number of claims legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company and the alleged magnitude of such claims proceedings and government investigations has generally increased over time and may continue to increase The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellularenabled products and new claims may arise in the future including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks For example technology and other patentholding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several US jurisdictions as well as internationally in various countries The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages Regardless of the merit of particular claims defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive timeconsuming and disruptive to the Companys operations In recognition of these considerations the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur These agreements can also significantly increase the Companys cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Companys ability to offer certain products and services Except as described in Part I Item 3 of this Form 10K under the heading Legal Proceedings and in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12 Commitments Contingencies and Supply Concentrations under the heading Contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above managements expectations the Companys results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Further such an outcome can result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company and has from time to time required and can in the future require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Companys ability to offer certain products and services all of which could materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations and financial condition While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 12 The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide which exposes the Company to potential liabilities increased costs and other adverse effects on the Companys business The Companys global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including antitrust privacy data security and data localization consumer protection advertising sales billing and ecommerce financial services and technology product liability intellectual property ownership and infringement digital platforms machine learning and artificial intelligence internet telecommunications and mobile communications media television film and digital content availability of thirdparty software applications and services labor and employment anticorruption import export and trade foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions antimoney laundering foreign ownership and investment tax and environmental health and safety including electronic waste recycling product design and climate change Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Companys business by increasing the Companys costs limiting the Companys ability to offer a product service or feature to customers imposing changes to the design of the Companys products and services impacting customer demand for the Companys products and services and requiring changes to the Companys supply chain and its business New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied These risks and costs may increase as the Companys products and services are introduced into specialized applications including health and financial services The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance the Companys employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Companys policies and procedures If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations it could materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations and financial condition Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Companys business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures For example the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products Although the Company has programs policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation As a result the Companys products could be banned delayed or prohibited from importation which could materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations and financial condition Expectations relating to environmental social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities increased costs reputational harm and other adverse effects on the Companys business Many governments regulators investors employees customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental social and governance considerations relating to businesses including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions human and civil rights and diversity equity and inclusion In addition the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various nonfinancial reports information provided on its website press statements and other communications Responding to these environmental social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties requires investments and depends in part on thirdparty performance or data that is outside the Companys control The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental social and governance goals and initiatives In addition some stakeholders may disagree with the Companys goals and initiatives Any failure or perceived failure by the Company to achieve its goals further its initiatives adhere to its public statements comply with federal state or international environmental social and governance laws and regulations or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations financial condition and stock price The technology industry including in some instances the Company is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which exposes the Company to increasing regulation government investigations legal actions and penalties From time to time the Company has made changes to its App Store including actions taken in response to litigation competition market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements The Company expects to make further business changes in the future including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store such as the EU Digital Markets Act which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024 or similar laws in other jurisdictions Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 13 The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could individually or in the aggregate have a materially adverse impact on the Companys business results of operations and financial condition For example the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business all of which could materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations and financial condition The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store which has resulted in changes to the Companys business practices and may in the future result in further changes Further the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that if resolved against those other companies could materially adversely affect the Companys commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations and financial condition For example the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Companys platforms and applications and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings There can be no assurance the Companys business will not be materially adversely affected individually or in the aggregate by the outcomes of such investigations litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future Changes to the Companys business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Companys products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Companys products and services and result in harm to the Companys reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services and lost sales The Companys business is subject to a variety of US and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of various types of personal information In many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy information provided on its website press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others In addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personal information the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws such as health data financial data and biometric data Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Companys compliance with these obligations If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Companys agreements with healthcare or financial institutions the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements Under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which could materially adversely affect the Companys business reputation results of operations and financial condition Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 14 Financial Risks The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate The Companys profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels For example the gross margins on the Companys products and services vary significantly and can change over time The Companys gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors including continued industrywide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures increased competition the Companys ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services compressed product life cycles supply shortages potential increases in the cost of components outside manufacturing services and developing acquiring and delivering content for the Companys services the Companys ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively shifts in the mix of products and services or in the geographic currency or channel mix including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings fluctuations in foreign exchange rates inflation and other macroeconomic pressures and the introduction of new products or services including new products or services with higher cost structures These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Companys results of operations and financial condition The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales cost of sales and operating expenses Further the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lowerthananticipated demand for the Companys products or services issues with new product or service introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the Companys logistics components supply or manufacturing partners The Companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the US dollar relative to local currencies The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to nonUS dollardenominated sales cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide Gross margins on the Companys products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar adversely affects the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the Companys products In some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the US dollars strengthening which would adversely affect the US dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currencydenominated sales Conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar while generally beneficial to the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit Additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins The Company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio The Companys investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity credit deterioration financial results market and economic conditions political risk sovereign risk interest rate fluctuations or other factors As a result the value and liquidity of the Companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially Therefore although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations and financial condition Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 15 The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance and a significant portion of the Companys trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers The Companys exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited The Company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company In addition the Company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components As of September 30 2023 the Companys vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses The Company is subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new US or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities The Company is subject to taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions including Ireland and Singapore where a number of the Companys subsidiaries are organized Due to economic and political conditions tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other nonincome taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change For example the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules including the introduction of global minimum tax standards The Companys effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the introduction of new taxes and changes in tax laws or their interpretation The application of tax laws may be uncertain require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the US Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations If the Companys effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of the Companys taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the Companys business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected General Risks The price of the Companys stock is subject to volatility The Companys stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future Additionally the Company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have from time to time experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Companys Board of Directors and the Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations the price of the Companys stock may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 1C Cybersecurity Not applicable Apple Inc

segments are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business Item 3 Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games Inc Epic filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of California the District Court against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and Californias unfair competition law based upon the Companys operation of its App Store On September 10 2021 the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epics claim The District Court found that certain provisions of the Companys App Store Review Guidelines violate Californias unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their

pending the appeal Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operating results The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above managements expectations the Companys financial

and estimates that affect the amounts reported Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to income taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions The evaluation of the Companys uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries Although management believes the Companys reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Companys reserves Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax examination Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable the

and operating results Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 25 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks however they may still impact the Companys consolidated financial statements Interest Rate Risk The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in US interest rates and their impact on the Companys investment portfolio and term debt Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Companys investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Companys term debt To protect against interest rate risk the Company may use derivative instruments offset interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Companys investment portfolio and term debt including the effects of any associated derivatives that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30 2023 and September 24 2022 dollars in millions Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase Potential Impact 2023 2022 Investment portfolio 100 basis points all tenors Decline in fair value 3089 4022 Term debt 100 basis points all tenors Increase in annual interest expense 194 201 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Companys exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the US dollar Changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the US dollar will negatively affect the Companys net sales and gross margins as expressed in US dollars Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Companys assets and liabilities To protect against foreign exchange rate risk the Company may use derivative instruments offset exposures or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services However the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost The Company applied a valueatrisk VAR model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the Companys foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates Based on the results of the model the Company estimates with 95 confidence a maximum oneday loss in fair value of 669 million and 10 billion as of September 30 2023 and September 24 2022 respectively Changes in the Companys underlying foreign currency exposures which were excluded from the assessment generally offset changes in the fair values of the Companys foreign currency

10K 33 Note 2 Revenue The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers For most of the Companys Products net sales control transfers when products are shipped For the Companys Services net sales control transfers over time as services are delivered Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services as applicable The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Companys expectations and historical experience For arrangements with multiple performance obligations which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices SSPs When available the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs When observable prices are not available SSPs are established that reflect the Companys best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis The Companys process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including where applicable prices charged by the Company for similar offerings market trends in the pricing for similar offerings productspecific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone Mac iPad and certain other products The first performance obligation which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain productrelated bundled services which include iCloud Siri and Maps The third performance obligation is the right to receive on a whenandifavailable basis future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations the allocation of revenue is based on the Companys estimated SSPs Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer which generally occurs when the product is shipped Revenue allocated to the productrelated bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided For certain longterm service arrangements the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered For these arrangements the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services Accordingly the Company has not recognized revenue and does not disclose amounts related to these undelivered services For the sale of thirdparty products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of thirdparty products including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product For thirdparty applications sold through the App Store the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer Therefore the Company accounts for all thirdparty applicationrelated sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains Apple Inc 2023 Form 10K 34 Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023 2022 and 2021 were as follows

of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones personal computers tablets wearables and accessories Therefore many components

components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new
