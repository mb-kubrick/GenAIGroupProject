a large variety of product types service offerings and delivery channels The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive and we face a broad array of

that provide information technology services or products including onpremises or cloudbased infrastructure and other services 7 companies that design manufacture market or sell consumer electronics telecommunication and electronic devices and 8 companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection price and convenience including fast and reliable fulfillment Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality speed and reliability of our services and tools as well as customers ability and willingness to change business practices Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers greater brand recognition and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses They may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours lockin potential customers with restrictive terms and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping which enhances the ability of new smaller or lesserknown businesses to compete against us Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents domain names trade dress trade secrets proprietary technologies

significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results including components of our financial results cash flows liquidity and stock price These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations In addition the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks We Face Intense Competition Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors across geographies including crossborder competition and in different industries including physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail ecommerce services web and infrastructure computing services electronic devices digital content advertising grocery and transportation and logistics services Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition particularly with our newlylaunched products and services and in our newer geographic regions They may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing Competition continues to intensify including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business In addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices continue to increase our competition The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping which enhances the ability of new smaller or lesser known businesses to compete against us As a result of competition our product and service offerings may not be successful we may fail to gain or may lose business and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management Operational Financial and Other Resources We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions and our expansion increases these factors Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results Our Expansion into New Products Services Technologies and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings These offerings which can present new and difficult technology challenges may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues In addition profitability if any in our newer activities may not meet our expectations and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies products or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide A softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the US or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers demands 6 Table of Contents our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers our ability to offer products on favorable terms manage inventory and fulfill orders the introduction of competitive stores websites products services price decreases or improvements changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet ecommerce electronic devices and web services including outside the US timing effectiveness and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure the success of our geographic service and product line expansions the extent to which we finance and the terms of any such financing for our current operations and future growth the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results variations in the mix of products and services we sell variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery continue to reduce prices worldwide and provide additional benefits to our customers factors affecting our reputation or brand image the extent to which we invest in technology and content fulfillment and other expense categories increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware viruses phishing and other spam emails denial of service attacks data theft computer intrusions outages and similar events and disruptions from natural or manmade disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities labor or trade disputes and similar events Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally In certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed It is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and stores and promote our brand internationally Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including local economic and political conditions government regulation such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products services and content including uncertainty as a result of less Internetfriendly legal systems local laws lack of legal precedent and varying rules regulations and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights business licensing or certification requirements such as for imports exports web services and electronic devices limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection privacy network security encryption payments advertising and restrictions on pricing or discounts 7 Table of Contents lower levels of use of the Internet lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the US lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences different employeeemployer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable US and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties laws and policies of the US and other jurisdictions affecting trade foreign investment loans and taxes and geopolitical events including war and terrorism As international physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail and other services grow competition will intensify including through adoption of evolving business models Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names The inability to hire train retain and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth The Peoples Republic of China PRC and India regulate Amazons and its affiliates businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the Internet IT infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii Internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services For example in order to meet local ownership regulatory licensing and cybersecurity requirements we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services In India the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities For wwwamazonin we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to thirdparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are thirdparty sellers on the wwwamazonin marketplace Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory licensing or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours In addition our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place Violation of any existing or future PRC Indian or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties having licenses revoked or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers Failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity increased costs and impairment charges any of which could materially harm our business As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively In addition failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments We and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers Under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers The inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience In addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or manmade disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues labor or trade disputes and similar events 8 Table of Contents The Seasonality of Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations We expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth When we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could materially reduce profitability We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services In addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand We generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers As a result of holiday sales as of December 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances Our Commercial Agreements Strategic Alliances and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks We provide physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships Under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service We may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other companys sales Therefore when the other companys offerings are not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated Moreover we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services As our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results Our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses impairment of other relationships variability in revenue and income from entering into amending or terminating such agreements or relationships and difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making Integrating and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments We have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies These transactions create risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses problems retaining key personnel additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill including as a result of acquisitions 9 Table of Contents the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes or at all the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration the difficulty of integrating a new companys accounting financial reporting management information and information security human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investees financial performance into our financial results for investments in which an investees financial performance is incorporated into our financial results either in full or in part the dependence on the investees accounting financial reporting and similar systems controls and processes the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest and for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries As a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms if at all In addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations Due to these fluctuations operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances As we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased We also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds Euros and Japanese Yen When the US Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business We depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly Jeffrey P Bezos our President CEO and Chairman We do not have key person life insurance policies We also rely on other highly skilled personnel Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire train retain and manage qualified personnel could harm our business We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches Because we collect process store and transmit large amounts of data including confidential sensitive proprietary and business and personal information failure to prevent or mitigate data loss theft misuse or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors or customers technology products and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss disclosure or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation regulatory action including under privacy or data protection laws and potential liability for us deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services and otherwise harm our business and reputation We use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches and 10 Table of Contents although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent such incidents including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a thirdparty vendor or customer such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services Steps we take to add software and hardware upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been or in the future could be damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or manmade disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions Any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient In addition our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy We Face Significant Inventory Risk In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products spoilage and other factors We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell Demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale In addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties We regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business Furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources Moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights We have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties Such claims whether or not meritorious have in the past and may in the future result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or significant payments for damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 11 Table of Contents Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business model The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A as well as changes in interest rates conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in quarterly variations in operating results fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internetrelated companies in particular changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public changes in the valuation methodology of or performance by other ecommerce or technology companies and transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports news and speculation Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail digital content web services electronic devices artificial intelligence technologies and services and other products and services that we offer or sell These regulations and laws cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution transportation mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection employment trade and protectionist measures web services the provision of online payment services registration licensing and information reporting requirements unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities the design and operation of websites health safety and sanitation standards the characteristics legality and quality of products and services product labeling the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems and other matters It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel data protection and personal privacy apply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet ecommerce digital content web services electronic devices and artificial intelligence technologies and services A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations and the extent nature and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws regulations or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations For example the European Commission announced that it has opened an investigation to assess whether aspects of our operations with marketplace sellers violate EU competition rules Unfavorable regulations laws decisions or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations or inquiries investigations or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines diminish the demand for or availability of our products and services increase our cost of doing business require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business damage our reputation impede our growth or otherwise have a material effect on our operations Claims Litigation Government Investigations and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims litigation reviews investigations and other proceedings including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities involving a wide range of issues including patent and other intellectual property matters taxes labor and employment competition and antitrust privacy and data protection consumer protection commercial disputes goods and services offered by us and by third parties and other matters The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products services and operations have become more complex and available to and used by more people Any of these types of 12 Table of Contents proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs disruption of our operations diversion of management resources negative publicity and other factors The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes Until the final resolution of such matters we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows In addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings including as a result of a settlement could involve licenses sanctions consent decrees or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments preventing us from offering certain products or services requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies damaging our reputation or otherwise having a material effect on our operations We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the US federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions Such changes could come about as a result of economic political and other conditions An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures including revenuebased taxes targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services These include new obligations to collect sales consumption value added or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations For example the European Union certain member states and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers suppliers and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price and changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities In the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain For example the legislation known as the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the US Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by US tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the US Tax Act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced The US Treasury Department the IRS and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the US Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered As future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us Developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks We have significant suppliers including content and technology licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content We do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits Decisions by our current suppliers to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all In addition violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws regulations contractual 13 Table of Contents terms intellectual property rights of others or our Supply Chain Standards as well as products or practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous could expose us to claims damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations Our contracts with US as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business In addition some of these contracts provide for termination by the government at any time without cause We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness death or environmental or property damage and can require product recalls or other actions Third parties who sell products using our services and stores increase our exposure to product liability claims such as when these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims Although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products we may not be able to detect enforce or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements In addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability We Are Subject to PaymentsRelated Risks We accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customers bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we currently are subject to and may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud For certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing In each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us We also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated We are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply Failure to comply with these rules or requirements as well as any breach compromise or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems could result in our being liable for card issuing banks costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected In addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures maintaining or processing data and authentication We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled In addition governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted Under our seller programs we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers descriptions and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful counterfeit pirated or stolen goods selling 14 Table of Contents goods in an unlawful or unethical manner violating the proprietary rights of others or otherwise violating our policies When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers Under our A2Z Guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our thirdparty seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None 15 Table of Contents Item 2 Properties As of December 31 2019 we operated the

statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding guidance industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position made in this Annual Report on Form 10K are forwardlooking We use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements Forwardlooking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer spending world events the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and cloud services the amount that Amazoncom invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products and services sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services the extent to which we owe income or other taxes competition management of growth potential fluctuations in operating results international growth and expansion the outcomes of claims litigation government investigations and other proceedings fulfillment sortation delivery and data center optimization risks of inventory management seasonality the degree to which we enter into maintain and develop commercial agreements proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions payments risks and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity In addition the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks These risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I Risk Factors Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content Generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by thirdparty sellers as service sales We seek to increase unit sales across our stores through increased product selection across numerous product categories We also offer other services such as compute storage and database offerings fulfillment advertising publishing and digital content subscriptions Our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows 1 Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience To increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection producing original content increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs Our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run AWS and a portion of our marketing costs Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our online stores web services electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment and delivery networks and related facilities Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture _______________________ 1 See Results of Operations NonGAAP Financial Measures below for additional information on our nonGAAP free cash flows financial measures 2 Working capital consists of accounts receivable inventory and accounts payable 19 Table of Contents Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle 3 On average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by thirdparty sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content including AWS and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies We believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power the advances of wireless connectivity and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices We are also investing in AWS which offers a broad set of global compute storage database and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees In measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 507 million and 512 million as of December 31 2018 and 2019 Our financial reporting currency is the US Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends For example if the US Dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant Likewise if the US Dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the US economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes In addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates Currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons For additional information about each line item addressed above refer to Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Our Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31 2018 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31 2017 in Item 7 of Part II Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations _______________________ 3 The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days 20 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain Based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below We also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results For additional information see Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions Inventories Inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value This valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future As a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31 2019 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 230 million In addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand If we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the US federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions Tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation changes in the laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions In addition a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the US tax reform legislation commonly known as the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the US Tax Act Finally foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the US Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations The US Tax Act significantly changed how the US taxes corporations The US Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by US tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the US Tax Act significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced The US Treasury Department the IRS and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the US Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered As future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us Developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 21 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies is as follows in millions Year Ended December 31 2018 2019 Cash provided by used in Operating activities 30723 38514 Investing activities 12369 24281 Financing activities 7686 10066 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 413 billion and 550 billion as of December 31 2018 and 2019 Amounts held in foreign currencies were 138 billion and 153 billion as of December 31 2018 and 2019 and were primarily Euros British Pounds and Japanese Yen Cash provided by used in operating activities was 307 billion and 385 billion in 2018 and 2019 Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customers and advertisers offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly The increase in operating cash flow in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash charges such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation Cash provided by used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates Cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures including leasehold improvements incentives received from property and equipment vendors proceeds from asset sales cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities Cash provided by used in investing activities was 124 billion and 243 billion in 2018 and 2019 with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities Cash capital expenditures were 113 billion and 127 billion in 2018 and 2019 which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure the majority of which is to support AWS We made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 22 billion and 25 billion in 2018 and 2019 Cash provided by used in financing activities was 77 billion and 101 billion in 2018 and 2019 Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations and repayments of longterm debt and other and were 85 billion and 123 billion in 2018 and 2019 Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was 106 billion and 137 billion in 2018 and 2019 with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS which investments we expect to continue over time We had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program the Commercial Paper Program or unsecured revolving credit facility the Credit Agreement and 740 million of borrowings outstanding under our 740 million secured revolving credit facility the Credit Facility as of December 31 2019 See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Debt for additional information In 2018 and 2019 we recorded net tax provisions of 12 billion and 24 billion Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to US taxation under the US Tax Act which also repeals US taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign 22 Table of Contents subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the US in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts As of December 31 2019 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 134 billion Tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our US taxable income The US Tax Act enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through 2022 Cash taxes paid net of refunds were 12 billion and 881 million for 2018 and 2019 As of December 31 2019 we had approximately 17 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the US federal research and development credit As we utilize our federal tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis In connection with the European Commissions October 2017 decision against us on state aid Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount consistent with the European Commissions decision of approximately 250 million that we deposited into escrow in March 2018 subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases amounts due to thirdparty sellers in certain jurisdictions debt and standby and trade letters of credit To the extent we process payments for thirdparty sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from Cash and cash equivalents to restricted cash which is classified within Accounts receivable net and other and Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets As of December 31 2018 and 2019 restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 426 million and 321 million See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets Additionally purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 157 billion as of December 31 2019 These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months However any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty See Item 1A of Part I Risk Factors We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain finance and operating lease arrangements enter into financing obligations repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders In addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations We have organized our operations into three segments North America International and AWS These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its

and 2019 We believe that operating income loss is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services The decrease in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased shipping costs and marketing expense partially offset by increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 17 million and 23 million for 2018 and 2019 The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses partially offset by increased marketing expense Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by 258 million and 116 million for 2018 and 2019 The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 49 million and 273 million for 2018 and 2019 25 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses is as follows in millions Year

costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including video and music The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers Shipping costs which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs were 277 billion and 379 billion in 2018 and 2019 We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate we reduce shipping rates we use more expensive shipping methods including faster delivery and we offer additional services We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as Technology and content as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers 26 Table of Contents Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers physical stores and customer service centers and payment processing costs While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment AWS costs are primarily classified as Technology and content Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features Additionally because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher payment processing costs as a percent of net sales The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels and costs from expanding our fulfillment network which includes physical stores We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services We regularly evaluate our facility requirements Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services development design and maintenance of our stores curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores and infrastructure costs Infrastructure costs include servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation and amortization rent utilities and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses Collectively these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure These costs are allocated to segments based on usage The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2020 due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers which will impact each of our segments See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business and Accounting Policies Use of Estimates for additional information on the change in estimated useful life of our servers Marketing Marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities including sales commissions related to AWS We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels such as our sponsored search third party customer referrals social and online advertising television advertising and other initiatives Our marketing costs are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased spending on marketing channels as well as payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 27 Table of Contents General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses Other Operating Expense Income Net Other operating expense income net was 296 million and 201 million during 2018 and 2019 and is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was 440 million and 832 million during 2018 and 2019 We generally invest our excess cash in AAArated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested Interest expense was 14 billion and 16 billion in 2018 and 2019 The increase is primarily related to finance leases Our longterm lease liabilities were 97 billion and 398

Leases and Note 6 Debt for additional information Other Income Expense Net Other income expense net was 183 million and 203 million during 2018 and 2019 The primary components of other income expense net are related to equity securities and warrant valuations and foreign currency Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate intercompany transactions the applicability of special tax regimes changes in how we do business acquisitions investments auditrelated developments changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation foreign currency gains losses changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized Additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss For example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pretax income is lower We recorded a provision for income taxes of 12 billion and 24 billion in 2018 and 2019 Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in US pretax income a decline in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and the onetime provisional tax benefit of the US Tax Act recognized in 2018 Tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our US taxable income The US Tax Act enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through 2022 As of December 31 2019 we had approximately 17 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the US federal research and

risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our longterm debt Our longterm debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements However the fair value of our debt which pays interest at a fixed rate will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest We generally invest our excess cash in AAArated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm

income stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2019 and the related notes collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements In our opinion the consolidated financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Company at December 31 2019 and 2018 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2019 in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles We also have audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States PCAOB the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework and our report dated January 30 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon Adoption of New Accounting Standard As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the Company has changed its method for accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No 201602 Leases Topic 842 Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks Such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that 1 relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and 2 involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matter below providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter The Company is subject to income taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions and as discussed in Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements during the ordinary course of business there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain As a result significant judgment is required in evaluating the Companys tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes The Company uses significant judgment in 1 determining whether a tax positions technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and 2 measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition As of December 31 2019 the Company accrued liabilities of 39 billion for various tax contingencies Auditing the measurement of the Companys tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex involves significant judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings 35 Table of Contents How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the Companys process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained managements process to measure the benefit of its tax positions and the development of the related disclosures We involved our international tax transfer pricing and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Companys tax positions Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and as applicable developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto our procedures included obtaining and examining the Companys analysis including the Companys correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based We used our knowledge of and experience with international transfer pricing and other income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Companys accounting for its tax contingencies We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Companys positions We analyzed the Companys assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of the Companys calculations We have also evaluated the Companys income tax disclosures included in Note 9 in relation to these matters s Ernst Young LLP We have served as the

amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation including the addition of restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the reclassification of longterm capital lease obligations that existed at December 31 2018 from Other longterm liabilities to Longterm lease liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance See Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazoncom Inc and its consolidated entities collectively the Company consisting of its whollyowned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our seller lending financing activities Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated The financial results of Whole Foods Market Inc Whole Foods Market have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28 2017 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes Estimates are used for but not limited to income taxes useful lives of equipment commitments and contingencies valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill stockbased compensation forfeiture rates vendor funding and inventory valuation Actual results could differ materially from those estimates For example in Q4 2019 we completed a useful life study for our servers and are increasing the useful life from three years to four years for servers in January 2020 which based on servers that are included in Property and equipment net as of December 31 2019 will have an anticipated impact to our 2020 operating income of 23 billion Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weightedaverage outstanding common shares Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weightedaverage outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method In periods when we have a net loss stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect 42 Table of Contents The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares in millions Year Ended December 31 2017 2018 2019 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 480 487 494 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 13 13 10 Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 493 500 504 Revenue Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive reduced by estimates for return allowances promotional discounts and rebates Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties including sales and indirect taxes In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows Retail sales We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer which generally occurs upon our delivery to a thirdparty carrier or in the case of an Amazon delivery to the customer Thirdparty seller services We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us We are not the seller of record in these transactions The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a thirdparty carrier or in the case of an Amazon delivery to the customer Subscription services Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including audiobooks digital video digital music ebooks and other nonAWS subscription services Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single standready obligation Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period AWS Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute storage database and other services Revenue is allocated to services using standalone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services based on the quantity of services rendered such as compute or storage capacity delivered ondemand Certain services including compute and database are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term for which revenue is recognized ratably Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term Other Other revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions Return Allowances Return allowances which reduce revenue and cost of sales are estimated using historical experience Liabilities for return allowances are included in Accrued expenses and other and were 468 million 623 million and 712 million as of December 31 2017 2018 and 2019 Additions to the allowance were 18 billion 23 billion and 25 billion and deductions from the allowance were 19 billion 23 billion and 25 billion in 2017 2018 and 2019 Included in Inventories on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling 406 million 519 million and 629 million as of December 31 2017 2018 and 2019 for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products inbound and outbound shipping costs including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including video and music Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers Payment processing and related transaction costs including those associated with seller transactions are classified in Fulfillment on our consolidated statements of operations 43 Table of Contents Vendor Agreements We have agreements with our vendors to receive funds primarily for cooperative marketing efforts promotions incentives and volume rebates We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods including property and equipment or services and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory cost of services or cost of property and equipment Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments fulfillment centers physical stores and customer service centers including costs attributable to buying receiving inspecting and warehousing inventories picking packaging and preparing customer orders for shipment payment processing and related transaction costs including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions responding to inquiries from customers and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services development design and maintenance of our stores curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores and infrastructure costs Infrastructure costs include servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation and amortization rent utilities and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses Collectively these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred Marketing Marketing costs primarily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities including sales commissions related to AWS We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors and other third parties Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were 63 billion 82 billion and 110 billion in 2017 2018 and 2019 General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions including payroll and related expenses facilities and equipment expenses such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent and professional fees and litigation costs StockBased Compensation Compensation cost for all stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock Such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using the accelerated method The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including historical forfeiture experience and employee level Other Operating Expense Income Net Other operating expense income net consists primarily of marketingrelated contractbased and customerrelated intangible asset amortization expense and expenses related to legal settlements 44 Table of Contents Other Income Expense Net Other income expense net consists primarily of adjustments to and gains on equity securities of 18 million 145 million and 231 million in 2017 2018 and 2019 equity warrant valuation gains losses of 109 million 131 million and 11 million in 2017 2018 and 2019 and foreign currency gains losses of 247 million 206 million and 20 million in 2017 2018 and 2019 Income Taxes Income tax expense includes US federal and state and foreign income taxes Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to US taxation under the US Tax Act which also repeals US taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the US in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors We utilize a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions tax contingencies The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date To increase the comparability of fair value measures the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants These valuations require significant judgment For our cash cash equivalents or marketable securities we measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data We did not hold significant amounts of cash cash equivalents restricted cash or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31 2018 and 2019 We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies As of December 31 2018 and 2019 these warrants had a fair value of 440 million and 669 million and are recorded within Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets These assets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents 45 Table of Contents Inventories Inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value This valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers programs Thirdparty sellers maintain ownership of their inventory regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the thirdparty sellers and therefore these products are not included in our inventories We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products During the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm noncancellable commitments These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand If we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs We also have firm noncancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores Accounts Receivable Net and Other Included in Accounts receivable net and other on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers vendors and sellers As of December 31 2018 and 2019 customer receivables net were 94 billion and 126 billion vendor receivables net were 32 billion and 42 billion and seller receivables net were 710 million and 863 million Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory We estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred Receivables are considered impaired and writtenoff when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement The allowance for doubtful accounts was 348 million 495 million and 718 million as of December 31 2017 2018 and 2019 Additions to the allowance were 626 million 878 million and 10 billion and deductions to the allowance were 515 million 731 million and 793 million in 2017 2018 and 2019 Software Development Costs We incur software development costs related to products to be sold leased or marketed to external users internaluse software and our websites Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented All other costs including those related to design or maintenance are expensed as incurred Property and Equipment Net Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction in our costs Property includes buildings and land that we own along with property we have acquired under buildtosuit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment heavy equipment and other fulfillment equipment Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building three years for our servers five years for networking equipment ten years for heavy equipment and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations Leases We categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment net All other leases are categorized as operating leases Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services such as operations and maintenance For leases of property we account for these other services as a component of the lease For substantially all other leases the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated standalone prices 46 Table of Contents Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from Other assets upon lease commencement Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term When we have the option to extend the lease term terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date or purchase the leased asset and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement of the lease Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices market interest rates or the level of sales at a physical store which are expensed as incurred Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straightline basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straightline basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term the lease term The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire longlived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs Financing Obligations We record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under buildtosuit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period If we continue to control the building after the construction period the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation If we do not control the building after the construction period ends the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized and we classify the lease as either operating or finance Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable In testing goodwill for impairment we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform a twostep impairment test We test goodwill for impairment under the twostep impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions We completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1 2019 and determined that goodwill is no t impaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test See Note 5 Acquisitions Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Other Assets Included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets net of accumulated amortization video and music content net of accumulated amortization longterm deferred tax assets certain equity investments marketable securities restricted for longer than one year the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations lease prepayments made prior to lease commencement and equity warrant assets Digital Video and Music Content We obtain video content inclusive of episodic television and movies and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed We reduce the liability as payments are made and we 47 Table of Contents amortize the asset to Cost of sales on an accelerated basis based on estimated usage or viewing patterns or on a straightline basis If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to Cost of sales predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 27 years Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit referred to as a film group in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value The total capitalized costs of video which is primarily released content and music as of December 31 2018 and 2019 were 38 billion and 58 billion Total video and music expense was 67 billion and 78 billion for the year ended December 31 2018 and 2019 Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content Investments We generally invest our excess cash in AAArated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities Such investments are included in Cash and cash equivalents or Marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets Marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over an investee Equitymethod investments are included within Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equitymethod investees amortization of basis differences and related gains or losses if any are classified as Equity method investment activity net of tax on our consolidated statements of operations Equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in Other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations As of December 31 2018 and 2019 these investments had a carrying value of 282 million and 15 billion Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in Marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in Other income expense net on our consolidated statement of operations We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments indicate impairment For debt securities and equitymethod investments we also evaluate whether declines in fair value of our investments below their book value are otherthantemporary This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs Additionally we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis Factors considered include quoted market prices recent financial results and operating trends implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities credit quality of debt instrument issuers other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments duration and severity of the decline in value and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment LongLived Assets Longlived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable For longlived assets used in operations including lease assets impairment losses are only recorded if the assets carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value Longlived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31 2018 and 2019 48 Table of Contents Accrued Expenses and Other Included in Accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations payroll and related expenses unredeemed gift cards customer liabilities current debt acquired digital media content and other operating expenses As of December 31 2018 and 2019 our liabilities for payroll related expenses were 34 billion and 43 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were 28 billion and 33 billion We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships Our total unearned revenue as of December 31 2018 was 79 billion of which 63 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31 2019 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31 2019 was 102 billion Included in Other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was 14 billion and 20 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31 2018 and 2019 Additionally we have performance obligations primarily related to AWS associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements For contracts with original terms that exceed one year those commitments not yet recognized were 298 billion as of December 31 2019 The weighted average remaining life of our longterm contracts is 33 years However the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage which can extend beyond the original contractual term Other LongTerm Liabilities Included in Other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to deferred tax liabilities financing obligations asset retirement obligations tax contingencies and digital video and music content Foreign Currency We have internationallyfocused stores for which the net sales generated as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations are denominated in local functional currencies The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into US Dollars at periodend foreign exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss a separate component of stockholders equity and in the Foreign currency effect on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash on our consolidated statements of cash flows Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in Other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances we recorded gains losses of 202 million 186 million and 95 million in 2017 2018 and 2019 Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In May 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update ASU amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers We adopted this ASU on January 1 2018 for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective approach and increased retained earnings by approximately 650 million The adjustment primarily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift cards which are now recognized over the expected customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote We changed the recognition and classification of Amazon Prime memberships which are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratably over the membership period as service sales Previously Prime memberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocated among product sales and service sales Other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue Certain advertising services are now classified as revenue rather than a reduction in cost of sales and sales of apps inapp content and certain digital media content are presented on a net basis Prior year amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policy The impact of applying this ASU for the year ended December 31 2018 primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and an increase in service sales driven by the reclassification of Prime membership fees of approximately 38 billion Service sales also increased by approximately 30 billion for the year ended December 31 2018 due to the reclassification of certain advertising services 49 Table of Contents In January 2016 the FASB issued an ASU that updates certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments Under this ASU certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements In February 2016 the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases primarily requiring the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than twelve months on our consolidated balance sheets Under the new guidance leases previously described as capital lease obligations and finance lease obligations are now referred to as finance leases and financing obligations respectively We adopted this ASU on January 1 2019 by recording an immaterial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods Prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policies resulting in a balance sheet presentation that is not comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption The adoption of this ASU resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately 21 billion which included the reclassification of finance lease obligations to operating leases of 12 billion As of December 31 2018 amounts related to finance lease obligations and construction liabilities totaled 96 billion of which 15 billion was derecognized for buildings that we do not control during the construction period and 54 billion and 15 billion were reclassified to finance leases and operating leases respectively In October 2016 the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer other than transfers of inventory when the transfer occurs For intercompany transfers of inventory the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately 250 million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances In November 2016 the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows The new guidance requires that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on a retrospective basis with the following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows in millions Year Ended December 31 2017 Previously Reported Adjustments As Revised Operating activities

the accounting for film costs inclusive of episodic television and movie costs The new guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television with that of movies by requiring production costs to be capitalized Previously we only capitalized a portion of the production costs related to our produced episodic television content We adopted this ASU as of January 1 2019 and began capitalizing substantially all of our production costs Adoption of this ASU resulted in approximately 10 billion of incremental capitalized film costs classified in Other Assets as of December

the following Beginning in August 2013 a number of complaints were filed alleging among other things that Amazoncom Inc and several of its subsidiaries failed to compensate hourly workers for time

refunds were 957 million 12 billion and 881 million for 2017 2018 and 2019 The US Tax Act was signed into law on December 22 2017 The US Tax Act significantly revised the US corporate income tax by among other things lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 eliminating certain deductions imposing a mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries introducing new tax regimes and changing how foreign earnings are subject to US tax The US Tax Act also enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through 2022 We reasonably estimated the effects of the US Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31 2017 We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the US Tax Act of approximately 789 million This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the US statutory corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 after taking into account the mandatory onetime tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries The amount of this onetime tax was not material In 2018 we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the US Tax Act 63 Table of Contents The components of the provision for income taxes net are as follows in

provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in US pretax income and the onetime provisional tax benefit of the US Tax Act recognized in 2017 This was partially offset by the reduction to the US federal statutory tax rate in 2018 a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and an increase in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction we review all available evidence including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors In Q2 2017 we 64 Table of Contents recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of 600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in US pretax income a decline in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and the onetime provisional tax benefit of the US Tax Act recognized in 2018 Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to US taxation under the US Tax Act which also repeals US taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our

tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027 Tax Contingencies We are subject to income taxes in the US federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes During the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain We establish reserves for taxrelated uncertainties based on estimates of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the outcome of tax audits The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 65 Table of Contents The reconciliation of

be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS for the calendar year 2007 and thereafter These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods In October 2014 the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid On October 4 2017 the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately 250 million plus interest for the period May 2006 through June 2014 and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount consistent with the European Commissions decision that we deposited into escrow in March 2018 subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals In December 2017 Luxembourg appealed the European Commissions decision In May 2018 we appealed We believe the European Commissions decision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China Germany India Japan Luxembourg and the United Kingdom We are under or may be subject to audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter Changes in state federal and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2019 The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes Note 10 SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments North America International and AWS We allocate to segment results the
