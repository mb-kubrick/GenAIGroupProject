recognition and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses They may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours lockin potential customers with restrictive terms and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping which enhances the ability of new smaller or lesserknown businesses to compete against us Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents domain names trade dress trade secrets proprietary technologies

of Contents Item 1A Risk Factors Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results including components of our financial results cash flows liquidity and stock price These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations In addition to the effects of the COVID19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of Part II Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the risk factors below additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below Business and Industry Risks We Face Intense Competition Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors across geographies including crossborder competition and in different industries including physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail ecommerce services web and infrastructure computing services electronic devices digital content advertising grocery and transportation and logistics services Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition particularly with our newlylaunched products and services and in our newer geographic regions They may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing Competition continues to intensify including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business In addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices continue to increase our competition The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping which enhances the ability of new smaller or lesser known businesses to compete against us As a result of competition our product and service offerings may not be successful we may fail to gain or may lose business and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits Our Expansion into New Products Services Technologies and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings These offerings which can present new and difficult technology challenges may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues In addition profitability if any in our newer activities may not meet our expectations and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies products or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally In certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed It is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and stores and promote our brand internationally Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including local economic and political conditions government regulation such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products services and content including uncertainty as a result of less Internetfriendly legal systems local laws lack of legal precedent and varying rules regulations and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights 6 Table of Contents business licensing or certification requirements such as for imports exports web services and electronic devices limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection data security network security consumer protection payments advertising and restrictions on pricing or discounts lower levels of use of the Internet lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the US lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences different employeeemployer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable US and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties laws and policies of the US and other jurisdictions affecting trade foreign investment loans and taxes and geopolitical events including war and terrorism As international physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail and other services grow competition will intensify including through adoption of evolving business models Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names The inability to hire train retain and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth The Peoples Republic of China PRC and India regulate Amazons and its affiliates businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the Internet IT infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii Internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services For example in order to meet local ownership regulatory licensing and cybersecurity requirements we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services In India the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities For wwwamazonin we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to thirdparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are thirdparty sellers on the wwwamazonin marketplace Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory licensing or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours In addition our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place Violation of any existing or future PRC Indian or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties having licenses revoked or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely 7 Table of Contents The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons including as a result of seasonality promotions product launches or unforeseeable events such as in response to natural or manmade disasters extreme weather or geopolitical events For example we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth When we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could materially reduce profitability We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services In addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand We generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers As a result of holiday sales as of December 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled In addition governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted Under our seller programs we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers descriptions and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful counterfeit pirated or stolen goods selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner violating the proprietary rights of others or otherwise violating our policies When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers Under our A2Z Guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our thirdparty seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties We regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business Furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources Moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights We have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties Such claims whether or not meritorious have in the past and may in the future result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or significant payments for damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 8 Table of Contents Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations Due to these fluctuations operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances As we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased We also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies including Euros British Pounds and Japanese Yen When the US Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa Operating Risks Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management Operational Financial and Other Resources We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions and our expansion increases these factors Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide A softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the US or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers demands our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers our ability to offer products on favorable terms manage inventory and fulfill orders the introduction of competitive stores websites products services price decreases or improvements changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet ecommerce electronic devices and web services including outside the US timing effectiveness and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure the success of our geographic service and product line expansions the extent to which we finance and the terms of any such financing for our current operations and future growth the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results variations in the mix of products and services we sell variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery continue to reduce prices worldwide and provide additional benefits to our customers factors affecting our reputation or brand image the extent to which we invest in technology and content fulfillment and other expense categories 9 Table of Contents increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due the extent to which new and existing technologies or industry trends restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware viruses phishing and other spam emails denial of service attacks data theft computer intrusions outages and similar events and disruptions from natural or manmade disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities labor or trade disputes and similar events We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers Failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity increased costs and impairment charges any of which could materially harm our business As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively In addition failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments We and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers Under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers The inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience In addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or manmade disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues labor or trade disputes and similar events We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches Because we collect process store and transmit large amounts of data including confidential sensitive proprietary and business and personal information failure to prevent or mitigate data loss theft misuse or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors or customers technology products and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss disclosure or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation liability or regulatory action including under laws related to privacy data protection data security network security and consumer protection deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services and otherwise harm our business and reputation We use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a thirdparty vendor or customer such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services Steps we take to add software and hardware upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results 10 Table of Contents Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been or in the future could be damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or manmade disasters extreme weather geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions Any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient In addition our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business We depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly Jeffrey P Bezos our President CEO and Chairman We do not have key person life insurance policies We also rely on other highly skilled personnel Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire train retain and manage qualified personnel could harm our business Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks We have significant suppliers including content and technology licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content We do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all In addition violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws regulations contractual terms intellectual property rights of others or our Supply Chain Standards as well as products or practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous could expose us to claims damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results Our Commercial Agreements Strategic Alliances and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks We provide physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships Under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service We may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other companys sales Therefore when the other companys offerings are not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated Moreover we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services As our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results Our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses impairment of other relationships variability in revenue and income from entering into amending or terminating such agreements or relationships and difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements 11 Table of Contents Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making Integrating and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments We have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies These transactions create risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses problems retaining key personnel additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill including as a result of acquisitions the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes or at all the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration the difficulty of integrating a new companys accounting financial reporting management information and data security human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investees financial performance into our financial results for investments in which an investees financial performance is incorporated into our financial results either in full or in part the dependence on the investees accounting financial reporting and similar systems controls and processes the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest and for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries As a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms if at all In addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results We Face Significant Inventory Risk In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products spoilage and other factors We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell Demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale In addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results We Are Subject to PaymentsRelated Risks We accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customers bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we currently are subject to and may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication 12 Table of Contents processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud For certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing In each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us We also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated We are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply Failure to comply with these rules or requirements as well as any breach compromise or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems could result in our being liable for card issuing banks costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected In addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate

regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business model The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A as well as changes in interest rates conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in quarterly variations in operating results fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internetrelated companies in particular changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public changes in the valuation methodology of or performance by other ecommerce or technology companies and transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports news and speculation Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both Legal and Regulatory Risks Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business

web services electronic devices advertising and artificial 13 Table of Contents intelligence technologies and services A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations and the extent nature and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws regulations or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations For example a number of regulators have opened investigations to assess whether aspects of our operations violate competition rules Unfavorable regulations laws decisions or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations or inquiries investigations or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines diminish the demand for or availability of our products and services increase our cost of doing business require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business damage our reputation impede our growth or otherwise have a material effect on our operations Claims Litigation Government Investigations and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims litigation reviews investigations and other proceedings including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities involving a wide range of issues including patent and other intellectual property matters taxes labor and employment competition and antitrust privacy data protection data security network security consumer protection commercial disputes goods and services offered by us and by third parties and other matters The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products services and operations have become more complex and available to and used by more people Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs disruption of our operations diversion of management resources negative publicity and other factors The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes Until the final resolution of such matters we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows In addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings including as a result of a settlement could involve licenses sanctions consent decrees or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments preventing us from offering certain products or services requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies damaging our reputation or otherwise having a material effect on our operations We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness death or environmental or property damage and can require product recalls or other actions Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims Although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products we may not be able to detect enforce or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements In addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability 14 Table of Contents We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the US federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions Such changes could come about as a result of economic political and other conditions An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures including revenuebased taxes targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services These include new obligations to collect sales consumption value added or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations For example the European Union certain member states and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers suppliers and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation In the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense assets and liabilities We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us Developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations Our contracts with US as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business In addition some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval andor provide

7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ForwardLooking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10K includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 All statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding guidance industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position made in this Annual Report on Form 10K are forwardlooking We use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements Forwardlooking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer spending world events the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and cloud services the amount that Amazoncom invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products and services sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services the extent to which we owe income or other taxes competition management of growth potential fluctuations in operating results international growth and expansion the outcomes of claims litigation government investigations and other proceedings fulfillment sortation delivery and data center optimization risks of inventory management variability in demand the degree to which we enter into maintain and develop commercial agreements proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions payments risks and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity In addition the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID19 pandemic amplify many of these risks These risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I Risk Factors Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content Generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by thirdparty sellers as service sales We seek to increase unit sales across our stores through increased product selection across numerous product categories We also offer other services such as compute storage and database offerings fulfillment advertising publishing and digital content subscriptions Our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience To increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection producing original content increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust See Results of Operations NonGAAP Financial Measures below for additional information on our nonGAAP free cash flows financial measures We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs Our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run AWS and a portion of our marketing costs Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our online stores web services electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related facilities Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle On average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors including our product mix the mix of sales The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days 19 Table of Contents by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by thirdparty sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content including AWS and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies We believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power data storage and analytics improved wireless connectivity and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to improve users experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in AWS which offers a broad set of ondemand technology services including compute storage database analytics and machine learning and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees In measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 512 million and 518 million as of December 31 2019 and 2020 Our financial reporting currency is the US Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends For example if the US Dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant Likewise if the US Dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the US economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes In addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates Currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons For additional information about each line item addressed above refer to Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures Our Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31 2019 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31 2018 in Item 7 of Part II Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Effects of COVID19 The COVID19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses as well as those of our customers suppliers and thirdparty sellers To serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers we have modified numerous aspects of our logistics transportation supply chain purchasing and thirdparty seller processes Beginning in Q1 2020 we made numerous process updates across our operations worldwide and adapted our fulfillment network to implement employee and customer safety measures such as enhanced cleaning and physical distancing personal protective gear disinfectant spraying and temperature checks Since February 2020 we have hired over 400000 fulltime and parttime employees to increase our fulfillment network capacity We incurred approximately 40 billion in COVID19 related costs in Q4 2020 for a total of more than 115 billion during 2020 We will continue to prioritize employee and customer safety and comply with evolving federal state and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees customers and communities 20 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes The SEC has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain Based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below We also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results For additional information see Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures Although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions Inventories Inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value This valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future As a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31 2020 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 270 million In addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand If we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the US federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions Tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain In addition our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic political and other conditions such as the COVID19 pandemic and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our stock price changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation changes in the laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions In addition a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us Developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals 21 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows in millions Year Ended December 31 2019 2020 Cash provided by used in Operating activities 38514 66064 Investing activities 24281 59611 Financing activities 10066 1104 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 550 billion and 844 billion as of December 31 2019 and 2020 Amounts held in foreign currencies were 153 billion and 235 billion as of December 31 2019 and 2020 and were primarily Euros British Pounds and Japanese Yen Cash provided by used in operating activities was 385 billion and 661 billion in 2019 and 2020 Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customers and advertisers offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments on our longterm obligations Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us our receivables from consumers settle quickly The increase in operating cash flow in 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and changes in working capital Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including variability in demand inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates Cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures including leasehold improvements incentives received from property and equipment vendors proceeds from asset sales cash outlays for acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities Cash provided by used in investing activities was 243 billion and 596 billion in 2019 and 2020 with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases maturities and sales of marketable securities Cash capital expenditures were 127 billion and 350 billion in 2019 and 2020 which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure the majority of which is to support AWS which investments we expect to continue over time We made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 25 billion and 23 billion in 2019 and 2020 Cash provided by used in financing activities was 101 billion and 11 billion in 2019 and 2020 Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds of shortterm debt and other and longtermdebt of 23 billion and 173 billion in 2019 and 2020 Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of shortterm debt and other longterm debt finance leases and financing obligations of 123 billion and 184 billion in 2019 and 2020 Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was 137 billion and 116 billion in 2019 and 2020 reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS We had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility the Credit Agreement 725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program the Commercial Paper Program and 338 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility the Credit Facility as of December 31 2020 See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Debt for additional information As of December 31 2020 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were 172 billion We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the US in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts Tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our US taxable income and all remaining federal tax credits which were primarily related to the US federal research and development credit reduced our federal tax liability in 2020 US tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through 2022 Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2018 and 2019 and a partial election for 2020 Cash taxes paid net of refunds were 881 million and 17 billion for 2019 and 2020 We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis rather than on a financial reporting basis In connection with the European Commissions October 2017 decision against us on state aid Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount consistent with the 22 Table of Contents European Commissions decision of approximately 250 million that we deposited into escrow in March 2018 subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals As of December 31 2019 and 2020 restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 321 million and 257 million See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets Additionally purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were 266 billion as of December 31 2020 These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months However any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty See Item 1A of Part I Risk Factors We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain finance and operating lease arrangements enter into financing obligations repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position The COVID19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have caused significant market volatility These disruptions can contribute to defaults in our accounts receivable affect asset valuations resulting in impairment charges and affect the availability of lease and financing credit as well as other segments of the credit markets We have utilized a range of financing methods to fund our operations and capital expenditures and expect to continue to maintain financing flexibility in the current market conditions However due to the rapidly evolving global situation it is not possible to predict whether unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders In addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations We have organized our operations into three segments North America International and AWS These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 Segment Information Effects of COVID19 As reflected in the discussion below the impact of the COVID19 pandemic and actions taken in response to it had varying effects on our 2020 results of operations Higher net sales in the North America and International segments reflect increased demand particularly as people are staying at home including for household staples and other essential and home products partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints Other effects in the North America and International segments include increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales primarily due to the impact of lower productivity increased employee hiring and benefits and costs to maintain safe workplaces We expect the effects of fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints elevated collection risk in our accounts receivable and increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue into all or portions of Q1 2021 However it is not possible to determine the duration and scope of the pandemic including any recurrence the actions taken in response to the pandemic the scale and rate of economic recovery from the pandemic any ongoing effects on consumer demand and spending patterns or other impacts of the pandemic and whether these or other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations

sales growth see Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates below North America sales increased 38 in 2020 compared to the prior year The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers including from our shipping offers and increased demand including for household staples and other essential and home products partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints International sales increased 40 in 2020 compared to the prior year The

13531 Consolidated 14541 22899 Operating income was 145 billion and 229 billion for 2019 and 2020 We believe that operating income loss is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services The increase in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to COVID19 We expect North America operating income to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID19 related costs Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by 23 million and 8 million for 2019 and 2020 The International operating income in 2020 as compared to the operating loss in the prior year is primarily due to increased unit sales including sales by thirdparty sellers and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to COVID19 We expect International operating income to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID19 related costs Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income loss by 116 million and 411 million for 2019 and 2020 The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity including a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure both of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth and reduced prices for our customers Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating

centers and where we are the transportation service provider and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including video and music The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales We expect cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID19 related costs Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers Shipping costs which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs were 379 billion and 611 billion in 2019 and 2020 We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate we use more expensive shipping methods including faster delivery and we offer additional services We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as Technology and content as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers 27 Table of Contents Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers physical stores and customer service centers and payment processing costs While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in Fulfillment AWS costs are primarily classified as Technology and content Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled the extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features Additionally sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels costs from expanding our fulfillment network and the COVID19 related impact of lower productivity increased employee hiring and benefits and costs to maintain safe workplaces We expect fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID19 related costs We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services We regularly evaluate our facility requirements Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services development design and maintenance of our stores curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores and infrastructure costs Infrastructure costs include servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation and amortization rent utilities and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses Collectively these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure These costs are allocated to segments based on usage The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers See Item 8

commissions related to AWS We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels such as our sponsored search third party customer referrals social and online advertising television advertising and other initiatives Our marketing costs are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities partially offset by lower spending on marketing channels as a result of COVID19 While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely 28 Table of Contents General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees Other Operating Expense Income Net Other operating expense income net was 201 million and 75 million during 2019 and 2020 and was primarily related to a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in Q4 2020 offset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was 832 million and 555 million during 2019 and 2020 We generally invest our excess cash in AAArated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested Interest expense was 16 billion in 2019 and 2020 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases Our longterm lease liabilities were 398 billion and 526 billion as of December 31 2019 and 2020 Our longterm debt was 234 billion and 318 billion as of December 31 2019 and 2020 See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 Leases and Note 6 Debt for additional information Other Income Expense Net Other income expense net was 203 million and 24 billion during 2019 and 2020 The primary components of other income expense net are related to equity warrant valuations equity securities valuations and adjustments and foreign currency Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate intercompany transactions the applicability of special tax regimes changes in how we do business acquisitions investments auditrelated developments changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation foreign currency gains losses changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss For example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pretax income is lower In addition we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions and the effects of the COVID19 pandemic on our business make estimates of future income more challenging We recorded a provision for income taxes of 24 billion and 29 billion in 2019 and 2020 See Item 8 of Part II Financial

flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures For example these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions Additionally our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time Therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated

reflect Amazoncoms expectations as of February 2 2021 and are subject to substantial uncertainty Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer spending world events the rate of growth of the Internet online commerce and cloud services as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I Risk Factors This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 2 2021 regarding the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on our operations including those discussed above and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control including the duration and scope of the pandemic including any recurrence actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures our ability to continue operations in affected areas and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers creditors and thirdparty sellers all of which are uncertain This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook will be in line with those experienced during the first quarter of 2021 to date and the additional assumptions set forth below However it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the first quarter of 2021 or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations First Quarter 2021 Guidance Net sales are expected to be between 1000 billion and 1060 billion or to grow between 33 and 40 compared with first quarter 2020 This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 300 basis points from foreign exchange rates Operating income is expected to be between 30 billion and 65 billion compared with 40 billion in first quarter 2020 This guidance assumes approximately 20 billion of costs

income stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2020 and the related notes collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements In our opinion the consolidated financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Company at December 31 2020 and 2019 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2020 in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles We also have audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States PCAOB the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework and our report dated February 2 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks Such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that 1 relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and 2 involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matter below providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter The Company is subject to income taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions and as discussed in Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements during the ordinary course of business there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain As a result significant judgment is required in evaluating the Companys tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes The Company uses significant judgment in 1 determining whether a tax positions technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and 2 measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition As of December 31 2020 the Company accrued liabilities of 28 billion for various tax contingencies Auditing the measurement of the Companys tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex involves significant judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings 36 Table of Contents How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the Companys process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained managements process to measure the benefit of its tax positions and the development of the related disclosures We involved our international tax transfer pricing and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Companys tax positions Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and as applicable developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto our procedures included obtaining and examining the Companys analysis including the Companys correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based We used our knowledge of and experience with international transfer pricing and other income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Companys accounting for its tax contingencies We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Companys positions including recent decisions in relevant court cases We analyzed the Companys assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of the Companys calculations We have also evaluated the Companys income tax disclosures included in Note 9 in relation to these matters s Ernst Young LLP We have served as the Companys auditor since 1996 Seattle Washington February 2 2021 37 Table of Contents AMAZONCOM INC CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS in

Note 10 Segment Information Prior Period Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation Proceeds from shortterm debt and other were reclassified from Proceeds from longterm debt and other and Repayments of shortterm debt and other were reclassified from Repayments of longterm debt and other on our consolidated statements of cash flows Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazoncom Inc and its consolidated entities collectively the Company consisting of its whollyowned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our seller lending financing activities Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes Estimates are used for but not limited to income taxes useful lives of equipment commitments and contingencies valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill stockbased compensation forfeiture rates vendor funding inventory valuation collectability of receivables and valuation and impairment of investments Given the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID19 pandemic these estimates have become more challenging and actual results could differ materially from these estimates We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis and effective January 1 2020 we changed our estimate of the useful life for our servers from three years to four years The longer useful life is due to continuous improvements in our hardware software and data center designs The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31 2020 based on servers that were included in Property and equipment net as of December 31 2019 and those acquired during the year ended December 31 2020 was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of 27 billion and an increase in net income of 20 billion or 406 per basic share and 398 per diluted share 43 Table of Contents Supplemental Cash Flow Information The following table shows supplemental cash flow information in millions Year Ended December 31 2018 2019 2020

Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weightedaverage outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method In periods when we have a net loss stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares in millions Year Ended December 31 2018 2019 2020 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 487 494 500 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 13 10 10 Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 500 504 510 Revenue Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive reduced by estimates for return allowances promotional discounts and rebates Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties including sales and indirect taxes In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows Retail sales We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer which generally occurs upon our delivery to a thirdparty carrier or in the case of an Amazon delivery to the customer Thirdparty seller services We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us We are not the seller of record in these transactions The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a thirdparty carrier or in the case of an Amazon delivery to the customer Subscription services Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video audiobooks digital music ebooks and other nonAWS subscription services Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single standready obligation Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period AWS Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute storage database and other services Revenue is allocated to services using standalone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services based on the quantity of services rendered such as compute or storage capacity delivered ondemand Certain services including compute and database are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term for which revenue is recognized ratably Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term 44 Table of Contents Other Other revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions Return Allowances Return allowances which reduce revenue and cost of sales are estimated using historical experience Liabilities for return allowances are included in Accrued expenses and other and were 623 million 712 million and 859 million as of December 31 2018 2019 and 2020 Additions to the allowance were 23 billion 25 billion and 35 billion and deductions from the allowance were 23 billion 25 billion and 36 billion in 2018 2019 and 2020 Included in

related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including video and music Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers Payment processing and related transaction costs including those associated with seller transactions are classified in Fulfillment on our consolidated statements of operations Vendor Agreements We have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts promotions incentives and volume rebates We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods including property and equipment or services and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory cost of services or cost of property and equipment Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments fulfillment centers physical stores and customer service centers including costs attributable to buying receiving inspecting and warehousing inventories picking packaging and preparing customer orders for shipment payment processing and related transaction costs including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions responding to inquiries from customers and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services development design and maintenance of our stores curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores and infrastructure costs Infrastructure costs include servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation and amortization rent utilities and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses Collectively these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred Marketing Marketing costs primarily consist of

products and services are expensed as incurred and were 82 billion 110 billion and 109 billion in 2018 2019 and 2020 45 Table of Contents General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions including payroll and related expenses facilities and equipment expenses such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent and professional fees and litigation costs StockBased Compensation Compensation cost for all equityclassified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock Such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using the accelerated method The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including historical forfeiture experience and employee level Additionally stockbased compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash These liabilityclassified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration Other Operating Expense Income Net Other operating expense income net consists primarily of a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in Q4 2020 offset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets Other Income Expense Net Other income expense net consists primarily of valuations and adjustments of equity securities of 145 million 231 million and 833 million in 2018 2019 and 2020 equity warrant valuation gains losses of 131 million 11 million and 15 billion in 2018 2019 and 2020 and foreign currency gains losses of 206 million 20 million and 35 million in 2018 2019 and 2020 During the period from January 1 2021 to February 2 2021 we expect to record upward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies of approximately 15 billion In addition for this same period our equity and equity warrant investments in public companies which are subject to volatility based on changes in market prices have experienced gains of approximately 15 billion based on available trading prices Income Taxes Income tax expense includes US federal and state and foreign income taxes Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current US taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the US We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the US in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors The effects of the COVID19 pandemic on our business make estimates of future earnings in relevant jurisdictions more challenging We utilize a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions tax contingencies The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense 46 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date To increase the comparability of fair value measures the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants These valuations require significant judgment We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31 2019 and 2020 We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies As of December 31 2019 and 2020 these warrants had a fair value of 669 million and 30 billion and are recorded within Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in Other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents Inventories Inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value This valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category The inventory valuation allowance representing a writedown of inventory was 16 billion and 23 billion as of December 31 2019 and 2020 We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers programs Thirdparty sellers maintain ownership of their inventory regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the thirdparty sellers and therefore these products are not included in our inventories We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products During the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm noncancellable commitments These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand If we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs We also have firm noncancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores Accounts Receivable Net and Other Included in Accounts receivable net and other on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers vendors and sellers As of December 31 2019 and 2020 customer receivables net were 126 billion and 148 billion vendor receivables net were 42 billion and 48 billion and seller receivables net were 863 million and 381 million Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses including our historical experience of actual losses Receivables are considered impaired and writtenoff when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement The allowance for doubtful accounts was 495 million 718 million and 11 billion as of December 31 2018 2019 and 2020 Additions to the allowance were 878 million 10 billion and 14 billion and deductions to the allowance were 731 million 793 million and 10 billion in 2018 2019 and 2020 47 Table of Contents Software Development Costs We incur software development costs related to products to be sold leased or marketed to external users internaluse software and our websites Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented All other costs including those related to design or maintenance are expensed as incurred Property and Equipment Net Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs Property includes buildings and land that we own along with property we have acquired under buildtosuit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment heavy equipment and other fulfillment equipment Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building three years prior to January 1 2020 and four years subsequent to January 1 2020 for our servers five years for networking equipment ten years for heavy equipment and three to ten years for other fulfillment equipment Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations Leases We categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in Property and equipment net All other leases are categorized as operating leases Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services such as operations and maintenance For leases of property we account for these other services as a component of the lease For substantially all other leases the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated standalone prices Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from Other assets upon lease commencement Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term When we have the option to extend the lease term terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date or purchase the leased asset and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices market interest rates or the level of sales at a physical store which are expensed as incurred Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straightline basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straightline basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term the lease term The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire longlived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs Financing Obligations We record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under buildtosuit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period If we continue to control the building after the construction period the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation If we do not control the building after the construction period ends the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized and we classify the lease as either operating or finance 48 Table of Contents Goodwill and IndefiniteLived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so we perform a quantitative test We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value we recognize an impairment loss for the difference We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions We completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets as of April 1 2020 resulting in no impairments The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test See Note 5 Acquisitions Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Other Assets Included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content net of accumulated amortization acquired intangible assets net of accumulated amortization certain equity investments equity warrant assets longterm deferred tax assets and lease prepayments made prior to lease commencement Digital Video and Music Content We obtain video content inclusive of episodic television and movies and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to Cost of sales on an accelerated basis based on estimated usage or viewing patterns or on a straightline basis If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to Cost of sales predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 25 years Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit referred to as a film group in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value The total capitalized costs of video which is primarily released content and music as of December 31 2019 and 2020 were 58 billion and 68 billion Total video and music expense was 78 billion and 110 billion for the year ended December 31 2019 and 2020 Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content Investments We generally invest our excess cash in AAArated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities Such investments are included in Cash and cash equivalents or Marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets Marketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss Each reporting period we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through Other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in Other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations Each reporting period we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data If the investment is impaired we write it down to its estimated fair value As of December 31 2019 and 2020 these investments had a carrying value of 15 billion and 27 billion 49 Table of Contents Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to

regime is referred to as the ForeignDerived Intangible Income deduction FDII In addition certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current US taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the US The US tax rules also provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through 2022 Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2018 and 2019 and a partial election for 2020 61 Table of Contents

nondeductible stockbased compensation and excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation Our tax provision includes 16 billion 14 billion and 18 billion of excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation for 2018 2019 and 2020 Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in US pretax income a decline in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and the onetime provisional tax benefit of the US Tax Act recognized in 2018 Our provision for income taxes in 2020 was higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in pretax income This was partially offset by the impact of developments in our ongoing global tax controversies on taxes related to our foreign earnings and losses an increase in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and an increase in our foreign income deduction under FDII In addition our Luxembourg operations generated earnings in 2020 and utilized deferred tax assets previously subject to valuation allowances We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the US in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts 62 Table of Contents Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows in millions December 31 2019 2020

assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets including substantially all of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31 2020 Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of December 31 2020 were approximately 134 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual limitations under applicable tax law If not utilized a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2021 All remaining federal tax credits which were primarily related to the US federal research and development credit reduced our federal tax liability in 2020 We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction we review all available evidence including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors The effects of the COVID19 pandemic on our business make estimates of future earnings more challenging Since Q2 2017 we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg There is still significant uncertainty whether our earnings in Luxembourg are sustainable in the future and we will maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a release of the valuation allowance Tax Contingencies We are subject to income taxes in the US federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes During the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain We establish reserves for taxrelated uncertainties based on estimates of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the outcome of tax audits The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 63 Table of Contents

if fully recognized would decrease our effective tax rate The decrease in our tax contingencies in 2020 was primarily a result of developments in our global tax controversies As of December 31 2019 and 2020 we had accrued interest and penalties net of federal income tax benefit related to tax contingencies of 131 million and 83 million Interest and penalties net of federal income tax benefit recognized for the years ended December 31 2018 2019 and 2020 was 20 million 4 million and 48 million We are under examination or may be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS for the calendar year 2013 and thereafter These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods During Q3 2020 we resolved the audits of tax years 2007 through 2012 with the IRS for amounts that were materially consistent with our accrual In October 2014 the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid On October 4 2017 the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately 250 million plus interest for the period May 2006 through June 2014 and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount consistent with the European Commissions decision that we deposited into escrow in March 2018 subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals In December 2017 Luxembourg appealed the European Commissions decision In May 2018 we appealed We believe the European Commissions decision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China Germany India Japan Luxembourg and the United Kingdom We are under or may be subject to audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter Changes in tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years tax filings The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes Note 10 SEGMENT INFORMATION We
