compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world Our current and potential competitors include 1 physical ecommerce and omnichannel retailers publishers vendors distributors manufacturers and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses 2 publishers producers and distributors of physical digital and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels 3 web search engines comparison shopping websites social networks web portals and other online and

reliable fulfillment Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality speed and reliability of our services and tools as well as customers ability and willingness to change business practices Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers greater brand recognition and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses They may secure better terms from suppliers adopt more aggressive pricing pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours lockin potential customers with restrictive terms and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping which enhances the ability of new smaller or lesserknown businesses to compete against us Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change

carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results including components of our financial results cash flows liquidity and stock price These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations In addition to the factors discussed in Item 7 of Part II Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the risk factors below global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances developments or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers including thirdparty sellers which could indirectly have a material adverse effect on us Business and Industry Risks We Face Intense Competition Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors across geographies including crossborder competition and in different industries including physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail ecommerce services web and infrastructure computing services electronic devices digital content advertising grocery and transportation and logistics services Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition particularly with our newlylaunched products and services and in our newer geographic regions They may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing Competition continues to intensify including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and wellfunded competitors and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business In addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning digital content and electronic devices continue to increase our competition The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping which enhances the ability of new smaller or lesser known businesses to compete against us As a result of competition our product and service offerings may not be successful we may fail to gain or may lose business and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits Our Expansion into New Products Services Technologies and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings These offerings which can present new and difficult technology challenges may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience or are otherwise impacted by service disruptions delays setbacks or failures or quality issues In addition profitability or other intended benefits if any in our newer activities may not meet our expectations and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them which investments are often significant Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies products or services could result in the 6 Table of Contents value of those investments being written down or written off In addition our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies which could harm our business or damage our reputation Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally In certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed It is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and stores and promote our brand internationally Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including local economic and political conditions government regulation such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs and restrictions around the import and export of certain products technologies and components nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products services and content including uncertainty as a result of less internetfriendly legal systems local laws lack of legal precedent and varying rules regulations and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights business licensing or certification requirements such as for imports exports web services and electronic devices limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow laws and regulations regarding privacy data use data protection data security data localization network security consumer protection payments advertising and restrictions on pricing or discounts lower levels of use of the internet lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the US lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences different employeeemployer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable US and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties laws and policies of the US and other jurisdictions affecting trade foreign investment loans and taxes and geopolitical events including war and terrorism As international physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail cloud services and other services grow competition will intensify including through adoption of evolving business models Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names The inability to hire train retain and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth The Peoples Republic of China PRC and India regulate Amazons and its affiliates businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet IT infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services For example in order to meet local ownership regulatory licensing and cybersecurity requirements we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services In India the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities For wwwamazonin we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to thirdparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a thirdparty seller on the wwwamazonin marketplace Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in 7 Table of Contents their regulatory licensing or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours In addition our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place Violation of any existing or future PRC Indian or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties having licenses revoked or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely In addition because Chinabased sellers account for significant portions of our thirdparty seller services and advertising revenues and Chinabased suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods regulatory and trade restrictions data protection and cybersecurity laws economic factors geopolitical events security issues or other factors negatively impacting Chinabased sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons including as a result of seasonality promotions product launches or unforeseeable events such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary fears or rising inflation natural or humancaused disasters including public health crises or extreme weather including as a result of climate change or geopolitical events For example we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth When we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could materially reduce profitability We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services In addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand As a result of holiday sales as of December 31 of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly Typically there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and thirdparty seller sales Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled In addition governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted Under our seller programs we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers descriptions and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful counterfeit pirated or stolen goods selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner violating the proprietary rights of others or otherwise violating our policies When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers Under our Atoz Guarantee we may reimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our thirdparty seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties We regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business Furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights We may be 8 Table of Contents unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources Moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights We have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties Such claims whether or not meritorious have in the past and may in the future result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or significant payments for damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims In addition our and our customers use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims including those based on unauthorized use of thirdparty technology or content Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations Due to these fluctuations operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances As we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased We also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds Canadian Dollars Euros and Japanese Yen When the US Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa Operating Risks Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management Operational Financial and Other Resources We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions and our expansion increases these factors Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected Our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by among other things general economic business and geopolitical conditions worldwide A softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the US or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers demands our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers our ability to offer products on favorable terms manage inventory and fulfill orders the introduction of competitive stores websites products services price decreases or improvements 9 Table of Contents changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet ecommerce electronic devices and web services including outside the US timing effectiveness and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure the success of our geographic service and product line expansions the extent to which we finance and the terms of any such financing for our current operations and future growth the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results variations in the mix of products and services we sell variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery continue to reduce prices worldwide and provide additional benefits to our customers factors affecting our reputation or brand image including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments whether related to sustainability customers employees or other topics and public perceptions regarding social or ethical issues related to our development and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies products and services the extent to which we invest in technology and infrastructure fulfillment and other expense categories availability of and increases in the prices of transportation including fuel resources such as land water and energy commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products and technology infrastructure products including as a result of inflationary pressures constrained labor markets which increase our payroll costs the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due the extent to which new and existing technologies or industry trends restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware viruses phishing and other spam emails denial of service attacks data theft computer intrusions outages and similar events the extent to which we fail to maintain our unique culture of innovation customer obsession and longterm thinking which has been critical to our growth and success disruptions from natural or humancaused disasters including public health crises or extreme weather including as a result of climate change geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks armed hostilities and political conflicts including those involving China labor or trade disputes including restrictive governmental actions impacting us our customers and our thirdparty sellers and suppliers in China or other foreign countries and similar events and potential negative impacts of climate change including increased operating costs due to more frequent extreme weather events or climaterelated changes such as rising temperatures and water scarcity increased investment requirements associated with the transition to a lowcarbon economy decreased demand for our products and services as a result of changes in customer behavior increased compliance costs due to more extensive and global regulations and thirdparty requirements and reputational damage resulting from perceptions of our environmental impact We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers Failures to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity service interruptions increased costs and impairment charges any of which could materially harm our business As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively 10 Table of Contents In addition failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by increasing the distance products are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery We and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers For example productivity across our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire train and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like Under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network Our failure to adequately predict seller demand for storage or to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems staffing limitations or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience In addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or humancaused disasters including public health crises or extreme weather including as a result of climate change geopolitical events and security issues labor or trade disputes and similar events We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches Because we collect process store and transmit large amounts of data including confidential classified sensitive proprietary and business and personal information failure to prevent or mitigate data loss theft misuse unauthorized access or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors or customers technology products and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss disclosure or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation liability or regulatory action including under laws related to privacy data use data protection data security network security and consumer protection deter customers or sellers from using our stores products and services and otherwise harm our business and reputation We use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a thirdparty vendor or customer such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services Steps we take to add software and hardware upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been or in the future could be damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or humancaused disasters including public health crises or extreme weather including as a result of climate change geopolitical events and security issues including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities computer viruses physical or electronic breakins operational failures including from energy shortages and similar events or disruptions Any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient In addition our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business We depend on our senior management and other key personnel including our President and CEO We do not have key person life insurance policies We also rely on other highly skilled personnel Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate as well as senior management has historically been intense For example we experience 11 Table of Contents significant competition in the technology industry particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff In addition changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies policies which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees the failure to successfully transition key roles or the inability to hire train retain and manage qualified personnel could harm our business We also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores fulfillment network and data centers and carry out our other operations Failure to successfully hire train manage and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations increase payroll and other costs and harm our business and reputation In addition changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees independent contractors and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs decrease our operational flexibility and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time These organizational efforts if successful decrease our operational flexibility which could adversely affect our operating efficiency In addition our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks We have significant suppliers including content and technology licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content We do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural or humancaused disasters including public health crises or geopolitical events or for other reasons may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all For example we rely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products including products related to artificial intelligence infrastructure such as graphics processing units Constraints on the availability of these products could adversely affect our ability to develop and operate artificial intelligence technologies products or services In addition violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws regulations contractual terms intellectual property rights of others or our Supply Chain Standards as well as products or practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous could expose us to claims damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results Our Commercial Agreements Strategic Alliances and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks We provide physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail cloud services and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships Under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service We may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other companys sales Therefore when the other companys offerings are not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated Moreover we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services As our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results Our present and future commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships create additional risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses impairment of other relationships variability in revenue and income from entering into amending or terminating such agreements or relationships and difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements 12 Table of Contents Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making Integrating and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments We have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies These transactions involve risks such as disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses problems retaining key personnel additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill including as a result of acquisitions the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations the difficulty of completing such transactions including obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing conditions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes or at all the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration the difficulty of integrating a new companys accounting financial reporting management information and data security human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investees financial performance into our financial results for investments in which an investees financial performance is incorporated into our financial results either in full or in part or investments for which we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information the dependence on the investees accounting financial reporting and similar systems controls and processes the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest and for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries As a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms if at all In addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results We Face Significant Inventory Risk In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in customer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products spoilage and other factors We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell Demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale In addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product or offering a new service it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results We Are Subject to PaymentsRelated Risks We accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customers bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment 13 Table of Contents upon delivery For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we currently are subject to and may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud For certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing In each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us We also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated We are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply Failure to comply with these rules or requirements as well as any breach compromise or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems could result in our being liable for card issuing banks costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating results could be adversely affected In addition we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing regulatory inspection bonding and capital maintenance the use handling and segregation of transferred funds consumer disclosures maintaining or processing data and authentication We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments money laundering international money transfers privacy data use data protection data security data localization network security consumer protection and electronic fund transfers If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business model The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A as well as changes in interest rates conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in quarterly variations in operating results fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internetrelated companies in particular changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public changes in the valuation methodology of or performance by other ecommerce or technology companies and transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports news and speculation Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both Legal and Regulatory Risks Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet physical ecommerce and omnichannel retail digital content web services electronic devices advertising artificial intelligence technologies and services and other products and services that we offer or sell These regulations and laws cover taxation privacy data use data protection data security data localization network security consumer protection pricing content copyrights distribution transportation mobile communications electronic device certification

provision of online payment services registration licensing and information reporting requirements unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities the design and operation of websites health safety and sanitation standards the characteristics legality and quality of products and services product labeling the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems healthcare and other matters It is not clear how 14 Table of Contents existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel privacy data use data protection data security data localization network security and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the internet ecommerce digital content web services electronic devices advertising and artificial intelligence technologies and services A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations and the extent nature and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews investigations and other proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws regulations or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations For example we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations infringe competition rules including aspects of Amazons operation of its stores including its fulfillment network Amazons acquisitions and certain aspects of AWSs offering of cloud services We strongly dispute these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these investigations Similarly we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and regulations governing the collection use and disclosure of data the interpretation of which continues to evolve leading to uncertainty about how regulators will view our privacy practices In addition regulators and lawmakers are increasingly focused on controlling additional aspects of the operations of technology companies and companies they have characterized to be online gatekeepers through the application of existing regulations and laws and the adoption of new regulations and laws which increases our compliance costs and limits the operation of our business Unfavorable regulations laws decisions or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations or inquiries investigations or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines diminish the demand for or availability of our products and services increase our cost of doing business require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business damage our reputation impede our growth or otherwise have a material effect on our operations The media political and regulatory scrutiny we face which may continue to increase amplifies these risks Claims Litigation Government Investigations and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims litigation reviews investigations and other proceedings including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities involving a wide range of issues including patent and other intellectual property matters taxes labor and employment including the characterization of delivery drivers competition and antitrust privacy data use data protection data security data localization network security consumer protection commercial disputes goods and services offered by us and by third parties including artificial intelligence technologies and services and other matters The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach as our products services and operations have become more complex and available to and used by more people and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a preemptive basis For example we are litigating a number of matters alleging price fixing monopolization and consumer protection claims including those brought by state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs disruption of our operations diversion of management resources negative publicity and other factors The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes Until the final resolution of such matters we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows In addition it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings including as a result of a settlement could involve licenses sanctions consent decrees or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments preventing us from offering certain products or services requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies damaging our reputation or otherwise having a material effect on our operations We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness death or environmental or property damage and can require product recalls or other actions Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims Additionally under our Atoz Guarantee we may reimburse customers for certain product liability claims up to certain limits in these situations and as our thirdparty seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results Although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products we may not be able to detect enforce or collect sufficient damages for 15 Table of Contents breaches of such agreements In addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the US federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions Such changes could come about as a result of economic political and other conditions An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures including revenuebased taxes targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales consumption value added or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations For example nonUS jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented In addition the European Union and other countries including those in which we operate have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes which may increase our tax expense in future years Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers suppliers and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes changes in foreign exchange rates changes in our stock price changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation In the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense assets and liabilities We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us Developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities and judicial administrative and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations For example the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the US We are contesting this position however if this matter is adversely resolved we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations Our contracts with US as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business In addition some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval andor provide for termination by the government at any time without cause Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 1C Cybersecurity We have processes in place for assessing identifying and managing material risks from potential unauthorized occurrences on or through our electronic information systems that could adversely affect the confidentiality integrity or availability of our information systems or the information residing on those systems These include a wide variety of 16 Table of Contents mechanisms controls technologies methods systems and other processes that are designed to prevent detect or mitigate data loss theft misuse unauthorized access or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting the data The data include confidential proprietary and business and personal information that we collect process store and transmit as part of our business including on behalf of third parties We also use systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security incident at a thirdparty vendor or customer Additionally we use processes to oversee and identify material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with our use of thirdparty technology and systems including technology and systems we use for encryption and authentication employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions As part of our risk management process we conduct application security assessments vulnerability management penetration testing security audits and ongoing risk assessments We also maintain a variety of incident response plans that are utilized when incidents are detected We require employees with access to information systems including all corporate employees to undertake data protection and cybersecurity training and compliance programs annually We have a unified and centrallycoordinated team led by our chief security officer that is responsible for implementing and maintaining centralized cybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon in close coordination with senior leadership and other teams across Amazon Reporting to our chief security officer are a number of experienced chief information security officers responsible for various parts of our business including AWS each of whom is supported by a team of trained cybersecurity professionals In addition to our extensive inhouse cybersecurity capabilities at times we also engage assessors consultants auditors or other third parties to assist with assessing identifying and managing cybersecurity risks Our cybersecurity risks and associated mitigations are evaluated by senior leadership including as part of our enterprise risk assessments that are reviewed by the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors Such risks and mitigations are also subject to oversight by the Security Committee of our Board of Directors Additional information about cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in Item 1A of Part I Risk Factors under the heading We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches which should be read in conjunction with the information above The Security Committee which is comprised of independent directors oversees our policies and procedures for protecting our cybersecurity infrastructure and for compliance with applicable data protection and security regulations and related risks The Security Committee receives reports regarding such risks from management including our chief security officer and reports to the Board at least annually The Security Committee also oversees the Boards response to any significant cybersecurity incidents Our chief security officer who has extensive cybersecurity knowledge and skills gained from over 15 years of work experience on the security team at Amazon and an extensive career in the technology and cybersecurity industries as a senior executive in the federal government heads the team responsible for implementing and maintaining cybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon and reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer 17 Table of Contents Item 2 Properties As of December 31 2023 we operated the following facilities in thousands Description of Use Leased

identify forwardlooking statements Forwardlooking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending inflation interest rates regional labor market constraints world events the rate of growth of the internet online commerce cloud services and new and emerging technologies the amount that Amazoncom invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products and services sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services the extent to which we owe income or other taxes competition management of growth potential fluctuations in operating results international growth and expansion the outcomes of claims litigation government investigations and other proceedings fulfillment sortation delivery and data center optimization risks of inventory management variability in demand the degree to which we enter into maintain and develop commercial agreements proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions payments risks and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity In addition global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances developments or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks These risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from managements expectations are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I Risk Factors Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content Generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by thirdparty sellers as service sales We seek to increase unit sales across our stores through increased product selection across numerous product categories We also offer other services such as compute storage and database offerings fulfillment advertising publishing and digital content subscriptions Our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience To increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection producing original content increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust See Results of Operations NonGAAP Financial Measures below for additional information on our nonGAAP free cash flows financial measures We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs Our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run AWS and a portion of our marketing costs Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our online stores web services electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment network Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture We seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due Because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores our receivables from consumers settle quickly We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings supply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by thirdparty sellers the mix 20 Table of Contents of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment and other terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers We expect spending in technology and infrastructure will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and infrastructure including AWS and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies We believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power data storage and analytics improved wireless connectivity and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue to improve users experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in AWS which offers a broad set of ondemand technology services including compute storage database analytics and machine learning and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ridehailing services We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees In measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 106 billion and 108 billion as of December 31 2022 and 2023 Our financial reporting currency is the US Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends For example if the US Dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant Likewise if the US Dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the US economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes In addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates Currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons For additional information about each line item addressed above refer to Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures Our Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31 2022 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31 2021 in Item 7 of Part II Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company Based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below We also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results For additional information see Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Description of Business Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures Although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions Inventories Inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value This valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product 21 Table of Contents vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future As a measure of sensitivity for every 1 of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31 2023 we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately 355 million In addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand If we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the US federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions Tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change with or without notice due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain In addition our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors such as changes in our business operations acquisitions investments entry into new businesses and geographies intercompany transactions the relative amount of our foreign earnings including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits the applicability of special tax regimes changes in foreign exchange rates changes in our stock price changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation changes in the laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions In addition a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us Developments in an audit investigation or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs as well as for prior and subsequent periods We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of audits investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows in millions Year Ended December 31 2022 2023 Cash provided by used in Operating activities 46752 84946 Investing activities 37601 49833 Financing activities 9718 15879 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances which at fair value were 700 billion and 868 billion as of December 31 2022 and 2023 Amounts held in foreign currencies were 183 billion and 235 billion as of December 31 2022 and 2023 Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds Canadian Dollars Euros Indian Rupees and Japanese Yen Cash provided by used in operating activities was 468 billion and 849 billion in 2022 and 2023 Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customers and advertisers offset by cash payments we make for products and services employee compensation payment processing and related transaction costs operating leases and interest payments Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales The increase in operating cash flow in 2023 compared to the prior year was due to an increase in net income loss excluding noncash expenses and changes in working capital Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables including variability in demand inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipts and payments customer and vendor payment terms and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates Cash provided by used in investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures including leasehold improvements incentives received from property and equipment vendors proceeds from asset sales cash outlays for 22 Table of Contents acquisitions investments in other companies and intellectual property rights and purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities Cash provided by used in investing activities was 376 billion and 498 billion in 2022 and 2023 with the variability caused primarily by purchases sales and maturities of marketable securities and cash capital expenditures Cash capital expenditures were 583 billion and 481 billion in 2022 and 2023 which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure the majority of which is to support AWS business growth and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network which investments we expect to increase in 2024 We made cash payments net of acquired cash related to acquisition and other investment activity of 83 billion and 58 billion in 2022 and 2023 We funded the acquisitions of MGM Holdings Inc in 2022 and 1Life Healthcare Inc One Medical in 2023 with cash on hand In 2023 we invested 125 billion in a note from Anthropic PBC which is convertible into equity We have an agreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an additional 275 billion in a second convertible note Cash provided by used in financing activities was 97 billion and 159 billion in 2022 and 2023 Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from shortterm debt and other and longtermdebt of 627 billion and 181

obligations of 530 billion and 340 billion in 2022 and 2023 Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was 675 million and 642 million in 2022 and 2023 We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs we had 682 million of borrowings outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility and the entire amount of the term loan has been repaid as of December 31 2023 See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Debt for additional information As of December 31 2023 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were 47 billion We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the US in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts Our US taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses US tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property primarily equipment These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026 Our federal tax provision included a partial accelerated depreciation deduction election for 2021 and a full election for 2022 and 2023 Additionally effective January 1 2022 research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for US tax purposes which delays the deductibility of these expenses Cash paid for US federal and state and foreign income taxes net of refunds totaled 60 billion and 112 billion for 2022 and 2023 As of December 31 2022 and 2023 restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 365 million and 503 million See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 Debt and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets Additionally we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders including for inventory and capital expenditures that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months However any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty See Item 1A of Part I Risk Factors We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain finance and operating lease arrangements enter into financing obligations repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders In addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all In addition economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility which along with any increases in our borrowing levels could increase our future borrowing costs 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations We have organized our operations into three segments North America International and AWS These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10 Segment Information Overview Macroeconomic factors including inflation increased interest rates significant capital market and supply chain volatility and global economic and geopolitical developments have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify In addition changes in fuel utility and food costs interest rates and economic outlook may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns We also expect the current macroeconomic environment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our AWS revenue growth rates We expect some or all of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q1 2024 Net Sales Net sales include product and service sales Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross Service sales primarily represent thirdparty seller fees which includes commissions and any related

income was 122 billion and 369 billion for 2022 and 2023 We believe that operating income is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services The North America operating income in 2023 as compared to the operating loss in the prior year is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs and increased technology and infrastructure costs The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2023 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales partially offset by increased fulfillment and shipping costs and increased technology and infrastructure costs Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating loss by 246 million in 2023 The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2023 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased sales partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure both of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS business growth Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating income by 220 million in 2023 25 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses is as follows in millions

consumer products inbound and outbound shipping costs including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including video and music The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2023 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies and lower transportation rates Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by 254 million in 2023 Shipping costs were 835 billion and 895 billion in 2022 and 2023 Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate we use more expensive shipping methods and we offer additional services We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better terms with our suppliers and achieving better operating efficiencies We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as Technology and infrastructure as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers physical stores and customer service centers and payment processing costs While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in Fulfillment AWS costs are primarily classified as Technology and infrastructure Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and 26 Table of Contents fulfilled the extent to which thirdparty sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features Additionally sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2023 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies Changes in foreign exchange rates increased fulfillment costs by 52 million in 2023 We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services We regularly evaluate our facility requirements Technology and Infrastructure Technology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services development design and maintenance of our stores curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores and infrastructure costs Infrastructure costs include servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation and amortization rent utilities and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses Collectively these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ridehailing services We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure These costs are allocated to segments based on usage The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in absolute dollars in 2023 compared to the prior year is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities including sales commissions related to AWS We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels such as our sponsored search social and online advertising thirdparty customer referrals television advertising and other initiatives Our marketing costs are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2023 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely General and Administrative General and administrative costs were 119 billion and 118 billion during 2022 and 2023 and were primarily related to payroll and related expenses and professional fees Other Operating Expense Income Net Other operating expense income net was 13 billion and 767 million during 2022 and 2023 and was primarily related to asset impairments for physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities and physical store closures in 2023 and the amortization of intangible assets 27 Table of Contents Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was 989 million and 29 billion during 2022 and 2023 primarily due to an increase in prevailing rates We generally invest our excess cash in AAArated money market funds and investment grade short to intermediateterm marketable debt securities Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested Interest expense was 24 billion and 32 billion in 2022 and 2023 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 Leases and Note 6

and 938 million during 2022 and 2023 The primary components of other income expense net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments equity warrant valuations and foreign currency Included in other income expense net in 2022 and 2023 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain loss of 127 billion and 797 million from our equity investment in Rivian Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate intercompany transactions the applicability of special tax regimes changes in how we do business acquisitions investments developments in tax controversies changes in our stock price changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation foreign currency gains losses changes in statutes regulations case law and administrative practices principles and interpretations related to tax including changes to the global tax framework competition and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss For example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pretax income is lower In addition we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions We recorded a provision benefit for income taxes of 32 billion and 71 billion in 2022 and 2023 See Item 8 of Part II Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 9 Income Taxes for

free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures For example these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions Additionally our mix of

the three years in the period ended December 31 2023 and the related notes collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements In our opinion the consolidated financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Company at December 31 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2023 in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles We also have audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States PCAOB the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2023 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework and our report dated February 1 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks Such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that 1 relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and 2 involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matter below providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates 35 Table of Contents Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements the Company is subject to income taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain As a result significant judgment is required in evaluating the Companys tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes The Company uses significant judgment in 1 determining whether a tax positions technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and 2 measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition As of December 31 2023 the Company reported accrued liabilities of 52 billion for various tax contingencies Auditing the recognition and measurement of the Companys tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment Managements evaluation of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings and may be impacted by regulatory changes and judicial and examination activity How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the Companys process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained the measurement of the benefit of its tax positions both initially and on an ongoing basis and the development of the related disclosures We involved our international tax transfer pricing and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Companys tax positions Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and

equipment or services and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory cost of services or cost of property and equipment Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated we record a portion of the rebate

and related expenses facilities and equipment expenses such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent and professional fees StockBased Compensation Compensation cost for all equityclassified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock Such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using the accelerated method Under this method approximately 50 of the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stockbased compensation awards The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures If an award is forfeited early in its life the adjustment to compensation expense is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including historical forfeiture experience by grant year and employee level Additionally stockbased compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash These liabilityclassified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration Other Operating Expense Income Net Other operating expense income net consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets and

income expense net in 2022 and 2023 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain loss of 127 billion and 797 million from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive Inc Rivian Our investment in Rivians preferred stock was accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments prior to Rivians initial public offering in November 2021 which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock As of December 31 2023 we held 158 million shares of Rivians Class A common stock representing an approximate 16 ownership interest and an approximate 15 voting interest We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles and jointlyowned intellectual property and one of our employees serving on Rivians board of directors We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian which is included in Marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets and had a fair value of 29 billion and 37 billion as of December 31 2022 and December 31 2023 The investment was subject

liabilities 2424 2624 Total liabilities 4077 5904 Income Taxes Income tax expense includes US federal and state and foreign income taxes Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current US taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the US We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside of the US in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors We utilize a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions income tax contingencies The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes We include interest and penalties related to our income tax contingencies in income tax expense 46 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date To increase the comparability of fair value measures the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants These valuations require significant judgment We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31 2022 and 2023 We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies As of December 31 2022 and 2023 these warrants had a fair value of 21 billion and 22 billion and are recorded within Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in Other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations These warrants are classified as Level 2 and 3 assets Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents Inventories Inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout method and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value This valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category The inventory valuation allowance representing a writedown of inventory was 28 billion and 30 billion as of December 31 2022 and 2023 We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers programs Thirdparty sellers maintain ownership of their inventory regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the thirdparty sellers and therefore these products are not included in our inventories We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products During the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components We have certain noncancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand If we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs We also have firm noncancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market

finance leases are recorded in Property and equipment net All other leases are categorized as operating leases Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services such as operations and maintenance For leases of property we account for these other services as a component of the lease For substantially all other leases the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated standalone prices Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments reduced by landlord incentives plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from Other assets upon lease commencement Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term When we have the option to extend the lease term terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date or purchase the leased asset and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices market interest rates or the level of sales at a physical store which are expensed as incurred Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straightline basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straightline basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term the lease term The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire longlived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs Financing Obligations We record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under buildtosuit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period If we continue to control the building after the construction period the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation If we do not control the building after the construction period ends the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized and we classify the lease as operating 48 Table of Contents Goodwill and IndefiniteLived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so we perform a quantitative test We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value we recognize an impairment loss for the difference We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions We completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets as of April 1 2023 resulting in no impairments The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test See Note 5 Acquisitions Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets Other Assets Included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content net of accumulated amortization longterm deferred tax assets acquired intangible assets net of accumulated amortization equity warrant assets and certain equity investments satellite network launch services deposits and affordable housing loans We recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements such as cash or certain tax credits will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions These incentives are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses Digital Video and Music Content We obtain video content inclusive of episodic television and movies and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to Cost of sales on an accelerated basis based on estimated usage or viewing patterns or on a straightline basis If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to Cost of sales predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 35 years We review usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit referred to as a film group in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value The total capitalized costs of video which is primarily released content and music as of December 31 2022 and 2023 were 167 billion and 174 billion Total video and music expense was 166 billion and 189 billion for the year ended December 31 2022 and 2023 Total video and music expense includes licensing and production

accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments with adjustments recognized in Other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations Each reporting period we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the investee securities and other publicly available data If the investment is impaired we write it down to its estimated fair value As of December 31 2022 and 2023 these investments had a carrying value of 715 million and 754 million Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting or at fair value if we elect the fair value option if the investment gives us the

for which we have elected the fair value option are included in Marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in Other income expense net on our consolidated statements of operations LongLived Assets Longlived assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable For longlived assets used in operations including lease assets impairment losses are only recorded if the assets carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value Longlived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31 2022 and 2023 Accrued

highdeductible thirdparty insurance coverage for catastrophic losses we effectively selfinsure for exposure primarily related to workers compensation employee health care benefits general and product liability and automobile liability including liability resulting from thirdparty transportation service providers We estimate selfinsurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience frequency and costs of claims projected claims development inflation and other actuarial assumptions Changes in the number or costs of claims healthcare costs judgment and settlement amounts associated legal expenses and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates In the fourth quarter of 2022 we increased our reserves for general product and automobile liabilities by 13 billion primarily driven by changes in our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims which was primarily recorded in Cost of sales on our consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment Increases to our reserves driven by changes in estimates were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended

million and 519 million of tax shortfalls from stockbased compensation for 2022 and 2023 2 US companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income This regime is referred to as the ForeignDerived Intangible Income deduction and is dependent on the amount of our US taxable income We generated an income tax benefit in 2022 as compared to a provision for income taxes in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in pretax income and an increase in the foreign income deduction This was partially offset by a reduction in excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation and a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline in the favorable effects of corporate restructuring transactions The foreign income deduction benefit recognized in 2022 reflects a change in our application of tax regulations related to the computation of qualifying foreign income and includes a tax benefit of approximately 655 million related to years prior to 2022 65 Table of Contents We recorded a provision for income taxes in 2023 as compared to an income tax benefit in 2022 primarily due to an increase in pretax income a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline in the favorable effects of corporate restructuring transactions and an increase in tax shortfalls from stockbased compensation This was partially offset by an increase in federal research and development credits which included approximately 600 million of tax benefit recorded in 2023 related to a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated with our 2022 US federal RD credit We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely

capital gains as well as tax credits Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets including substantially all of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31 2023 Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of December 31 2023 were approximately 102 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual limitations under applicable tax law If not utilized a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2024 Income Tax Contingencies We are subject to income taxes in the US federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes During the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain We establish reserves for taxrelated uncertainties based on estimates of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the outcome of tax audits The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 66 Table of Contents The reconciliation of our income tax contingencies is as follows in millions December 31 2021 2022 2023 Gross tax contingencies January 1 2820 3242 4002

income tax contingencies of which 33 billion if fully recognized would decrease our effective tax rate As of December 31 2022 and 2023 we had accrued interest and penalties net of federal income tax benefit related to tax contingencies of 103 million and 194 million Interest and penalties net of federal income tax benefit recognized for the years ended December 31 2021 2022 and 2023 were 28 million 7 million and 91 million We are under examination or may be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China France Germany India Japan Luxembourg and the United Kingdom We are under or may be subject to audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income In September 2022 the Luxembourg tax authority LTA denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the US in 2021 When we are assessed by the LTA we will need to remit taxes related to this matter We believe the LTAs position is without merit we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter and we expect to recoup taxes paid The Indian tax authority ITA has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the US We will need to remit taxes related to this matter until it is resolved which payments could be significant in the aggregate We believe the ITAs position is without merit we are defending our position vigorously in the Indian courts and we expect to recoup taxes paid If this matter is adversely resolved we could recognize significant additional tax expense including for taxes previously paid In October 2014 the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid On October 4 2017 the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately 250 million plus interest for the period May 2006 through June 2014 and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount consistent with the European Commissions decision which we deposited into escrow in March 2018 subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals In December 2017 Luxembourg appealed the European Commissions decision In May 2018 we appealed On May 12 2021 the European Union General Court annulled the European Commissions state aid decision In July 2021 the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice In December 2023 the European Court of Justice affirmed the European Union General Courts decision Changes in tax laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies Due to various factors including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial administrative and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years tax filings The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes 67 Table of Contents Note 10 SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three
