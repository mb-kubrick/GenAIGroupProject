Alphabet the company we us our and similar terms include Alphabet Inc and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise Alphabet Google and other trademarks of ours appearing in this report are our property This report contains additional trade names and trademarks of other companies We do not intend our use or display of other companies trade names or trademarks to imply an endorsement or sponsorship of us by such companies or any relationship with any of these companies PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS Overview As our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders letter Google is not a conventional company We do not intend to become one That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots like artificial intelligence AI research and quantum computing We continue this work under the leadership of Sundar Pichai who has served as CEO of Google since 2015 and as CEO of Alphabet since 2019 Alphabet is a collection of businesses the largest of which is Google We report Google in two segments Google Services and Google Cloud we also report all nonGoogle businesses collectively as Other Bets Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business We take a longterm view and manage the portfolio of Other Bets with the discipline and rigor needed to deliver longterm returns Alphabets structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence Access and technology for everyone The Internet is one of the worlds most powerful equalizers it propels ideas people and businesses large and small Our mission to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998 Since then we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done We are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge health happiness and success Every year there are trillions of searches on Google and 15 of the searches we see every day are new We continue to invest deeply in AI and other technologies to ensure the most helpful search experience possible YouTube provides people with entertainment information and opportunities to learn something new And Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices providing intelligent help throughout a persons day no matter where they are We are continually innovating and building new product features that will help our users partners customers and communities We have invested more than 100 billion in RD over the last five years In addition with the onset of 4 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc the pandemic we have focused in particular on features that help people in their daily lives and that support businesses working to serve their customers For example we have added live busyness trends in Google Maps that help users instantly spot when a neighborhood or part of town is near or at its busiest We have also helped businesses navigate uncertainty during an uneven economic recovery and we have worked to address the complex challenge of distributing critical information about COVID19 vaccines to billions of people around the world Importantly we have made authoritative content a key focus area across both Google Search and YouTube to help users find trusted public health information Other Bets also remain focused on innovation through technology that can positively affect peoples lives For instance Waymo is working toward our goal of making transportation safer and easier for everyone and Verily is developing tools and platforms to improve health outcomes Moonshots Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done making only incremental changes This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time especially in technology where change tends to be revolutionary not evolutionary People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments As we said in the original founders letter we will not shy away from highrisk highreward projects that we believe in as they are the key to our longterm success The power of AI Across the company investments in AI and machine learning are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations and have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more helpful For example in May of 2021 we introduced Multitask Unified Model or MUM which has the potential to transform how Google helps with complex tasks MUM is trained across 75 different languages which means that it can learn from sources written in one language and help bring that information to people in another It is also multimodal so it understands information across text and images and in the future can expand to more modalities like video and audio We are currently experimenting with MUMs capabilities to make searching more natural and intuitive and even enable entirely new ways to search DeepMind also made a significant AIpowered breakthrough solving a 50yearold protein folding challenge which will help the world better understand one of lifes fundamental building blocks and will enable researchers to tackle new and difficult problems from fighting diseases to environmental sustainability DeepMind has since shared its new AlphaFold protein structure database which doubled the number of highaccuracy human protein structures available to researchers Google For reporting purposes Google comprises two segments Google Services and Google Cloud Google Services Serving our users We have always been a company committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people Our product innovations have made our services widely used and our brand one of the most recognized in the world Google Services core products and platforms include ads Android Chrome hardware Gmail Google Drive Google Maps Google Photos Google Play Search and YouTube each with broad and growing adoption by users around the world Our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago Rather than the ten blue links in our early search results users can now get direct answers to their questions using their computer mobile device or their own voice making it quicker easier and more natural to find what they are looking for This drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube With the continued adoption of mobile people are consuming more digital content by watching more videos playing more games listening to more music reading more books and using more apps than ever before Working with content creators and partners we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find great digital content Fueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and hardware That is why we continue to invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system Chrome browser and Chrome operating system as 5 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc well as growing our family of hardware devices We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make peoples lives easier by combining the best of our AI software and hardware This potential is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products such as Pixel 5a 5G and Pixel 6 phones the Fitbit Charge 5 Chromecast with Google TV and the new Google Nest Cams and Nest Doorbell Creating products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run The key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy security and user choice We protect user privacy and security with products that are secure by default and private by design and that keep users in control of their data Our privacypreserving technologies safeguard individual privacy and enhance data protection As the Internet evolves so does our approach to privacy and security We continue to enhance our antimalware features in Chrome and drive improvements such as autodelete controls that automatically delete web and app searches after 18 months And we continue to keep users and their passwords safe through advances like our builtin password manager How we make money We have built worldclass advertising technologies for advertisers agencies and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies Google Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search other properties YouTube and Google Network partners properties Google Network properties We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with advertisers Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple textbased ads Brand advertising helps enhance users awareness of and affinity for advertisers products and services through videos text images and other interactive ads that run across various devices We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brandbuilding marketing campaigns We have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways including filtering out invalid traffic removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year and closely monitoring the sites apps and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content We continue to look to the future and are making longterm investments that we expect to grow revenues beyond advertising including revenues from Google Play hardware and YouTube nonadvertising Google Play generates revenues from sales of apps and inapp purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store Hardware generates revenues from sales of Fitbit wearable devices Google Nest home products Pixel phones and other devices YouTube nonadvertising generates revenues from YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services Google Cloud Google was a company built in the cloud We continue to invest in infrastructure security data management analytics and AI We see significant opportunity in helping businesses utilize these strengths with features like data migration modern development environments and machine learning tools to provide enterpriseready cloud services including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build test and deploy applications on its highly scalable and reliable infrastructure Google Workspace collaboration tools which include apps like Gmail Docs Drive Calendar Meet and more are designed with realtime collaboration and machine intelligence to help people work smarter Because more and more of todays digital experiences are being built in the cloud Google Cloud products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently Google Cloud Platform generates revenues from infrastructure platform and other services 6 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Google Workspace generates revenues from cloudbased collaboration tools for enterprises such as Gmail Docs Drive Calendar and Meet Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a year Other Bets Across Alphabet we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries Alphabets investment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes emerging businesses at various stages of development ranging from those in the RD phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization and our goal is for them to become thriving successful businesses in the medium to long term While these earlystage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus scale and pace of investments Competition Our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business including from General purpose search engines and information services such as Baidu Microsofts Bing Naver Seznam Yahoo and Yandex Vertical search engines and ecommerce providers such as Amazon and eBay ecommerce Bookings Kayak travel queries Microsofts LinkedIn job queries and WebMD health queries Some users will navigate directly to such content websites and apps rather than go through Google Social networks offered by ByteDance Meta Snap and Twitter Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals rather than seeking information through traditional search engines Other online advertising platforms and networks such as Amazon AppNexus Criteo and Meta that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads our primary auctionbased advertising platform Other forms of advertising such as billboards magazines newspapers radio and television Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media both online and offline Companies that design manufacture and market consumer hardware products including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms such as Amazon Apple and Microsoft Digital assistant providers such as Amazon and Apple Providers of enterprise cloud services such as Alibaba Amazon Microsoft and Salesforce Providers of digital video services such as Amazon Apple ATT ByteDance Disney Hulu Meta and Netflix Other digital content and application platform providers such as Amazon and Apple Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products such as Meta Microsoft Salesforce and Zoom Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses Specifically for advertising competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining users for whom other products and services are literally one click away largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising as well as the general usefulness security and availability of our products and services advertisers primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads and ultimately customers and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels and content providers primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising and the terms of our agreements with them For additional information about competition see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K 7 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet Sustainability is one of our core values at Google and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do We have been a leader on sustainability and climate change since Googles founding over 20 years ago These are some of our key achievements over the past two decades In 2007 we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations In 2017 we became the first major company to match 100 of our annual electricity use with renewable energy which we have achieved for four consecutive years In 2020 we issued 575 billion in sustainability bondsthe largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in history at the time The net proceeds from the issuance are used to fund environmentally and socially responsible projects in the following eight areas energy efficiency clean energy green buildings clean transportation circular economy and design affordable housing commitment to racial equity and support for small businesses and COVID19 crisis response As of December 31 2020 we have allocated 347 billion of the net proceeds as outlined in our

emissions annually To accelerate the transition to a circular economy we are working to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations products and supply chains and to enable others to do the same We are also working to empower everyone with technology by committing to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by the end of 2022 through our core products To benefit the people and places where we operate we have set goals to replenish more water than we consume by 2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate We will focus on three areas enhancing our stewardship of water resources across Google office campuses and data centers replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and ecosystems in waterstressed communities and sharing technology and tools that help everyone predict prevent and recover from water stress We remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability and we will continue to lead and encourage others

employees vendors and temporary staff alike Government Regulation We are subject to numerous United States US federal state and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters Like other companies in the technology industry we face heightened scrutiny from both US and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain Our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could individually or in the aggregate increase our cost of doing business make our products and services less useful limit our ability to pursue certain business models cause us to change our business practices affect our

results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described below which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results and affect the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock Risks Specific to our Company We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising and reduced spending by advertisers a loss of partners or new and existing technologies that block ads online andor affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business We generated more than 80 of total revenues from the display of ads online in 2021 Many of our advertisers companies that distribute our products and services digital publishers and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value such as increased numbers of users or customers new sales leads increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternatives Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices as well as changes to other companies advertising andor data privacy practices have in the past and may in the future affect the advertising that we are able to provide which could harm our business In addition technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of thirdparty digital advertising Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results In addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns Adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected and may in the future affect the demand for advertising resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising which could harm our financial condition and operating results We face intense competition If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users customers and other partners we may not remain competitive which could harm our business and operating results Our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive Our businesses face changing technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of rival products and services To compete successfully we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative relevant and useful products services and technologies in a timely manner As our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services We must continue to invest significant resources in RD including through acquisitions in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services We have many competitors in different industries Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging startups Some competitors have longer operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions continuing to invest heavily in RD and in talent aggressively initiating intellectual property claims whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete aggressively for users advertisers customers and content providers Further discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny thereby affording them competitive advantages Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us Our operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of our users advertisers publishers customers and content providers As technologies continue to develop our competitors may be able to offer experiences that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive If our competitors are more successful than we are in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users advertisers publishers customers and content providers our operating results could be harmed Our ongoing investment in new businesses products services and technologies is inherently risky and could divert management attention and harm our financial condition and operating results 10 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies The investments that we are making across Google Services Google Cloud and Other Bets reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users advertisers publishers customers and content providers Our investments in Google Services Google Cloud and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and in pursuing new strategies we may incur unanticipated liabilities These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations and with respect to Other Bets the use of alternative investment governance or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives Within Google Services we continue to invest heavily in hardware including our smartphones home devices and wearables which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively Within Google Cloud we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterpriseready cloud services including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent particularly to support and scale our salesforce At the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives Within Other Bets we are investing significantly in the areas of health life sciences and transportation among others These investment areas face intense competition from large experienced and wellfunded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability In addition new and evolving products and services including those that use AI and machine learning raise ethical technological legal regulatory and other challenges which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation financial condition and operating results Our revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition Changes in device mix geographic mix ongoing product and policy changes product mix and property mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate We may also experience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products services and technologies or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services among other factors In addition we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields including products and services such as hardware Google Cloud and subscription products as well as significant investments in Other Bets all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance For additional information see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands as well as affect our ability to compete Our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products services and technologies For example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet Also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations Moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable 11 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets We also face risks associated with our trademarks For example there is a risk that the word Google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search Some courts have ruled that Google is a protectable trademark but it is possible that other courts particularly those outside of the US may reach a different determination If this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word Google to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brand Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete Also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results Our business depends on strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users advertisers customers content providers and other partners Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Services Google Cloud and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users advertisers customers content providers and other partners Our brands have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a number of factors including among others reputational issues thirdparty content shared on our platforms data privacy and security issues and developments and product or technical performance failures For example if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services andor products or objectionable practices by advertisers or otherwise to adequately address user concerns our users may lose confidence in our brands Furthermore failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business financial condition and operating results Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality trustworthy innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our financial condition operating results and prospects We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our internetbased services We rely on other companies to manufacture many of our finished products to design certain of our components and parts to participate in the distribution of our products and services and to design manufacture or assemble certain components and parts in our technical infrastructure Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them We have experienced andor may in the future experience supply shortages andor price increases that could negatively affect our operations driven by raw material component or part availability manufacturing capacity labor shortages industry allocations logistics capacity tariffs trade disputes and barriers natural disasters or pandemics the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention and increased storm severity and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers In addition some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and products are available from only one or limited sources and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption In addition a significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay product availability We may enter into longterm contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions We may be liable for materials and products that are not consumed due to market acceptance technological change obsolescences quality product recalls and warranty issues For instance because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volumebased pricing or minimum purchase requirements if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and negatively affect our financial results Furthermore certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply 12 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Our products and services have had and in the future may have quality issues resulting from design manufacturing or operations Sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective it could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and where applicable our company policies such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct regarding workplace and employment practices data security environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions canceled orders harm to key relationships and damage to our reputation Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims Interruption to interference with or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services which could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results In addition problems with the design or implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system could harm our business and operations The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems Our systems are vulnerable to damage interference or interruption from modifications or upgrades terrorist attacks natural disasters or pandemics the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention and increased storm severity power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses ransomware attacks computer denial of service attacks phishing schemes or other attempts to harm or access our systems Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters Our data centers are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism and in some cases to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators Some of our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic closure of a facility or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service In addition our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past and may contain in the future errors or vulnerabilities which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems In addition we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results We are in the process of a multiyear implementation of a new ERP system which is designed to accurately maintain our financial records enhance the flow of financial information improve data management and provide timely information to our management team As the phased implementation continues we may experience delays increased costs and other difficulties Failure to successfully design and implement the ERP system as planned could harm our business financial condition and operating results Additionally if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business our financial condition and operating results Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income and we plan to continue to grow internationally International revenues accounted for approximately 54 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the following restrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the US import and export requirements tariffs and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from offering products or providing services to a particular market or that could limit our ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular market and may increase our operating costs longer payment cycles in some countries increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges including the transfer of personal data between the EU and the United Kingdom and new customer requirements in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate 13 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc anticorruption laws such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties uncertainty regarding liability for services and content including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent and different employeeemployer relationships existence of works councils and labor unions and other challenges caused by distance language and cultural differences making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions Because we conduct business in currencies other than US dollars but report our financial results in US dollars we have faced and will continue to face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results Risks Related to our Industry People access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces our business could be harmed People access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers mobile phones smartphones laptops and tablets video game consoles voiceactivated speakers wearables automobiles and televisionstreaming devices Our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices In addition search queries are increasingly being undertaken via voiceactivated speakers apps social media or other platforms which could harm our business It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers suppliers distributors developers and users or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms could harm our business financial condition and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities Data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could damage our reputation cause us to incur significant liability and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services Software bugs or defects security breaches and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users and customers ability to use our products and services harming our business operations and reputation Concerns about including the adequacy of our practices with regard to the collection use governance disclosure or security of personal information or other dataprivacyrelated matters even if unfounded could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change Our products and services involve the storage handling and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information Software bugs theft misuse defects vulnerabilities in our products and services and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information which could result in litigation and other potential liability including regulatory fines and penalties as well as reputational harm Additionally our products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies and thus our technologies and software have contained and are likely in the future to contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities We have in the past discovered and may in the future discover some errors in our software code only after we have released the code Systems and control failures security breaches failure to comply with our privacy policies andor inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure seriously harm our reputation brand and business and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs theft misuse and security vulnerabilities or breaches We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis Cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time We have seen and will continue to see industrywide vulnerabilities such as the Log4j vulnerability reported in December 2021 which could affect our or other parties systems We expect to continue to experience such 14 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc incidents or vulnerabilities in the future Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack We may experience future security issues whether due to employee error or malfeasance or system errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties systems While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the time they occur and may remedy them quickly there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal financial and reputational harm including government inquiries and enforcement actions litigation and negative publicity Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target even taking all reasonable precautions including those required by law we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures Further if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate datasecurity practices or fail to comply with our terms and policies or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach our users information may be improperly accessed used or disclosed If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners or service providers security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would be harmed we could lose users and customers our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks including legal claims which may include classaction litigation and regulatory action fines and penalties Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations While we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities including dedicated worldwide incident response teams our response process particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic may not be adequate may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident As a result we may suffer significant legal reputational or financial exposure which could harm our business financial condition and operating results For additional information see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under Risks Related to Laws and Regulations below Our ongoing investments in safety security and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data In addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks we are making significant investments in safety security and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties including investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services As a result of these efforts we have in the past discovered and may in the future discover incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties However we may not have discovered and may in the future not discover all such incidents or activity whether as a result of our data limitations including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services the scale of activity on our platform or other factors including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third parties Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies the existence of false or undesirable user accounts election interference improper ad purchases activities that threaten peoples safety on or offline or instances of spamming scraping or spreading disinformation While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may remedy them quickly there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal financial and reputational harm including government inquiries and enforcement actions litigation and negative publicity We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement harm our reputation and brands require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations and adversely affect our business and financial results Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in monetary penalties and damages divert managements time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight Problematic content on our platforms including lowquality usergenerated content web spam content farms and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services We like others in the industry face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent While we invest significantly in efforts to promote highquality and relevant results and to detect and prevent lowquality content and 15 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc invalid traffic we have been unable and may continue to be unable to adequately detect and prevent all such abuses or promote uniformly highquality content Many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engines assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them Such efforts have affected and may continue to affect the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false misleading or undesirable content Although Englishlanguage web spam in our search results has been reduced and web spam in most other languages is limited we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings We continuously combat web spam in our search results including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spamlike less useful web content to rank highly We also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms We also face other challenges from lowquality and irrelevant content websites including content farms which are websites that generate large quantities of lowquality content to help them improve their search rankings We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from lowquality websites We also face other challenges on our platforms including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference activities that threaten the safety andor wellbeing of our users on or offline and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation If we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote highquality content it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms harming our financial condition or operating results It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory action which could result in monetary penalties and damages and divert managements time and attention Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users Internet access providers may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively Currently this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace including incumbent telephone companies cable companies mobile communications companies and governmentowned service providers Some of these providers have taken or have stated that they may take measures that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings or by providing our competitors preferential access Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers however substantial uncertainty exists in the US and elsewhere regarding such protections For example in 2018 the US Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules which could permit internet access providers to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services In addition in some jurisdictions our products and services have been subject to governmentinitiated restrictions or blockages These could harm existing key relationships including with our users customers advertisers andor content providers and impair our ability to attract new ones damage our reputation and increase costs thereby negatively affecting our business Risks Related to Laws Regulations and Policies We face increased regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in regulatory conditions laws and policies governing a wide range of topics that may negatively affect our business We and other companies in the technology industry face increased regulatory scrutiny enforcement action and other proceedings For instance the US Department of Justice joined by a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google on October 20 2020 alleging that Google violated US antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising Similarly on December 16 2020 a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated US antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology Various other regulatory agencies in the US and around the world including competition enforcers consumer protection agencies data protection authorities grand juries interagency consultative groups and a range of other governmental bodies have and continue to review and in some cases challenge our products and services and their compliance with laws and regulations around the world We continue to cooperate with these investigations and defend litigation where appropriate Various laws regulations investigations enforcement lawsuits and regulatory actions have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties injunctive relief ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations changes to our products and services alterations to our business models and operations and collateral litigation all of which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results 16 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Changes in international and local social political economic tax and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies have in the past and may in the future increase our cost of doing business and limit our ability to pursue certain business models offer products or services in certain jurisdictions or cause us to change our business practices We have in the past had to alter or stop offering certain products and services as a result of laws or regulations that made them unfeasible and new laws or regulations could result in our having to terminate alter or withdraw products and services in the future Additional costs of doing business new limitations or changes to our business model or practices could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results We are subject to regulations laws and policies that govern a wide range of topics including those related to matters beyond our core products and services For instance new regulations laws policies and international accords relating to environmental and social matters including sustainability climate change human capital and diversity are being developed and formalized in Europe the US and elsewhere which may entail specific targetdriven frameworks andor disclosure requirements We have implemented robust environmental and social programs adopted reporting frameworks and principles and announced a number of goals and initiatives including those related to environmental sustainability and diversity The implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments and our goals with all of their contingencies dependencies and in certain cases reliance on thirdparty verification andor performance are complex and ambitious and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve them Additionally there can be no assurance that our current programs reporting frameworks and principles will be in compliance with any new environmental and social laws and regulations that may be promulgated in the US and elsewhere and the costs of changing any of our current practices to comply with any new legal and regulatory requirements in the US and elsewhere may be substantial Furthermore industry and market practices may further develop to become even more robust than what is required under any new laws and regulations and we may have to expend significant efforts and resources to keep up with market trends and stay competitive among our peers A variety of new and existing laws andor interpretations could harm our business We are subject to numerous US and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters New laws and regulations or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices have made and may continue to make our products and services less useful limit our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions require us to incur substantial costs expose us to civil or criminal liability or cause us to change our business practices These laws and regulations are evolving and involve matters central to our business including among others Laws and regulations around the world focused on large technology platforms including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union and proposed antitrust legislation on selfpreferencing and mergers and acquisitions in the US which may limit certain business practices and in some cases create the risk of significant penalties Privacy laws such as the GDPR CCPA CPRA Virginia CDPA and ColoPA as defined and discussed further below Data protection laws passed by many states within the US and by certain countries regarding notification to data subjects andor regulators when there is a security breach of personal data Consumer protection laws including EUs New Deal for Consumers which could result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations New laws further restricting the collection processing andor sharing of advertisingrelated data Copyright or similar laws around the world including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market EUCD and EU member state transpositions These and similar laws that have been adopted or proposed introduce new licensing regimes that could affect our ability to operate The EUCD and similar laws could also increase the liability of some contentsharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users Some of these laws as well as followon administrative or judicial actions have also created or may create a new property right in news publications that limits the ability of some online services to link to interact with or present such content They may also require individual or collective compensation negotiations with news agencies and publishers for the use of such content which may result in payment obligations that significantly exceed the value that such content provides to Google and its users potentially harming our services commercial operations and business results Data localization laws which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored andor processed within that country 17 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Various US and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate the ability of online services to collect information from minors including the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the United Kingdoms AgeAppropriate Design Code Various laws with regard to content moderation and removal and related disclosure obligations such as the Network Enforcement Act in Germany and the European Unions pending Digital Services Act which may affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant fines if such laws are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices or when we may not proactively discover such content due to the scale of thirdparty content and the limitations of existing technologies Other countries including Singapore Australia and the United Kingdom have implemented or are considering similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content Various legislative litigation and regulatory activity regarding our Google Play billing policies and business model which could result in monetary penalties damages andor prohibition Various legislative and regulatory activity requiring disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms which may make it easier for websites to artificially promote lowquality deceptive or harmful content on services like Google Search and YouTube potentially harming the quality of our services In addition the applicability and scope of these laws as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain and could harm our business For example We rely on statutory safe harbors as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the US and the ECommerce Directive in Europe against liability for various linking caching and hosting activities Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us There are legislative proposals in both the US and EU that could reduce our safe harbor protection Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU on May 13 2014 on the right to be forgotten which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens The introduction of new businesses products services and technologies our activities in certain jurisdictions or other actions we take have subjected us and will likely continue to subject us to additional laws and regulations Our investment in a variety of new fields such as healthcare and payment services has expanded and will continue to expand the scope of regulations that apply to our business The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future Any failure on our part to comply with laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties We are subject to claims suits government investigations other proceedings and consent decrees that may harm our business financial condition and operating results We are subject to claims suits government investigations other proceedings and consent decrees involving competition intellectual property data privacy and security consumer protection tax labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products and services including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings we also are subject to a variety of claims including product warranty product liability and consumer protection claims related to product defects among other litigation We may also be subject to claims involving health and safety hazardous materials usage other environmental effects or service disruptions or failures Any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources negative publicity and other factors Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant judgment The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in and may in the future result in additional substantial fines penalties injunctions and other sanctions that could harm our business financial condition and operating results We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content Our products and services let users exchange information advertise products and services conduct business and engage in various online activities We also place advertisements displayed on other companies websites and we offer thirdparty products services andor content The law relating to the liability of online service providers for others activities on their services is still somewhat unsettled around the world Claims have been brought against us and we 18 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc expect will continue to be brought against us for defamation negligence breaches of contract copyright and trademark infringement unfair competition unlawful activity torts fraud or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services We may be subject to claims by virtue of our involvement in hosting transmitting marketing branding or providing access to content created by third parties Defense of such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources may result in monetary liabilities or penalties and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner Privacy and data protection regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas Any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results Authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and limits on encryption of user data Adverse legal rulings legislation or regulation have resulted in and may continue to result in fines and orders requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide services harming our business operations Complying with these evolving laws could result in substantial costs and harm the quality of our products and services negatively affecting our business and may be particularly challenging during certain times such as a natural disaster or pandemic Amongst others we are and will be subject to the following laws and regulations The General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users or customers or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU Ensuring compliance with the range of obligations created by the GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs Despite our efforts governmental authorities or others have asserted and may continue to assert that our business practices fail to comply with its requirements If our operations are found to violate the GDPR requirements we may incur substantial fines have to change our business practices and face reputational harm any of which could have an adverse effect on our business Serious breaches of the GDPR can result in administrative fines of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenues Fines of up to 2 of annual worldwide revenues can be levied for other specified violations Various state privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 CCPA which came into effect in January of 2020 the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA which will go into effect in 2023 the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act Virginia CDPA which will go into effect in 2023 and the Colorado Privacy Act ColoPA which will go into effect in 2023 all of which give new data privacy rights to their respective residents including in California a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices and impose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data SB327 in California which regulates the security of data in connection with internet connected devices Further we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive personal data The EUUS and the SwissUS Privacy Shield frameworks that previously allowed US companies that selfcertify to the US Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from the EU and Switzerland have been invalidated by the CJEU The CJEU upheld Standard Contractual Clauses SCCs as a valid transfer mechanism provided they meet certain requirements On June 4 2021 the European Commission published new SCCs for this purpose and we may have to adapt our existing contractual arrangements to meet these new requirements The validity of data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal regulatory and political developments in both Europe and the US such as recent recommendations from the European Data Protection Board decisions from supervisory authorities recent proposals for reform of the data transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data outside the United Kingdom and potential invalidation of other data transfer mechanisms which together with increased enforcement action from supervisory authorities in relation to crossborder transfers of personal data could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area andor the United Kingdom These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation including developments which create some uncertainty and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or harm the operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business For example in the EU several supervisory authorities have issued new guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directives requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies including limitations on the use of data across messaging products and specific requirements for enabling users to accept or reject cookies and have in some cases brought and may seek to bring in the future enforcement action in relation to those requirements In the US certain types of cookies may be deemed sales of personal information 19 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc within the CCPA and other state laws such that certain disclosure requirements and limitations apply to the use of such cookies In addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and carries the potential of service interruptions in those countries We face and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend result in significant damage awards or other costs including indemnification awards and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future We like other internet technology and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights In addition patentholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us As we have grown the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products services and technologies We have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others Other parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in US and international courts and the US International Trade Commission ITC for exclusion and ceaseanddesist orders which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the US or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements if licenses are available at all or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services They may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products services or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business Many of our agreements with our customers and partners including certain suppliers require us to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business Moreover intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers when obtainable may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims Furthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities including those associated with intellectual property claims Regardless of their merits intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle To the extent such claims are successful they may harm our business including our product and service offerings financial condition or operating results Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance longterm stockholder value and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves We engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares Further our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices increase their volatility reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders ability to influence corporate matters Our Class B stock has 10 votes per share our Class A stock has one vote per share and our Class C stock has no voting rights As of December 31 2021 Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 859 of our outstanding Class B stock which represented approximately 514 of the voting power of our outstanding common stock Through their stock ownership Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future In addition because our Class C stock carries no voting rights except as required by applicable law the issuance of the Class C stock including in future stockbased acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs could continue Larry and Sergeys current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also 20 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc affect Larry and Sergeys relative voting power This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable Provisions in Alphabets certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management These provisions include the following Our certificate of incorporation provides for a triclass capital stock structure As a result of this structure Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation death or removal of a director Our stockholders may not act by written consent which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders meeting Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirers own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company Our Board of Directors may issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock which makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us As a Delaware corporation we are also subject to certain Delaware antitakeover provisions Under Delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the Board of Directors has approved the transaction Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us General Risks The continuing effects of COVID19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant and may have an adverse effect on our business operations and our future financial performance Since COVID19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization our business operations and financial performance have been and may continue to be affected by the macroeconomic impacts resulting from the efforts to control the spread of COVID19 As a result of the scale of the ongoing pandemic including the introduction of new variants of COVID19 and vaccination and other efforts to control the spread our revenue growth rate and expenses as a percentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rates and our future operating results may fall below expectations Additionally we may experience a significant and prolonged shift in user behavior such as a shift in interests to less commercial topics As a result of the pandemic our workforce shifted to operating in a primarily remote working environment which continues to create inherent productivity connectivity and oversight challenges The effects of the ongoing pandemic are dynamic and uneven As we prepare to return our workforce in more locations back to the office we may experience increased costs andor disruption as we experiment with hybrid work models in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture Our operating results may fluctuate which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations Our operating results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many outside of our control including the cyclicality and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events As a result comparing our operating results including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues on a periodtoperiod basis may not be meaningful and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance Consequently our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations 21 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures could result in operating difficulties dilution and other consequences that may harm our business financial condition and operating results Acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures Some of the areas where we face risks include diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis if at all from governmental authorities or conditions placed upon approval that could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction failure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology implementation or remediation of controls procedures and policies at the acquired company integration of the acquired companys accounting human resource including cultural integration and retention of employees and other administrative

activities of the acquired company before the acquisition including patent and trademark infringement claims data privacy and security issues violations of laws commercial disputes tax liabilities warranty claims product liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities and litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairment of goodwill andor purchased longlived assets and restructuring charges any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results Also the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize In connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities which may harm our financial condition or operating results If we were to lose the services of key personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy Our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team For instance Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction All of our executive officers and key employees are atwill employees and we do not maintain any keyperson life insurance policies The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business We rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture we may not be able to grow effectively Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals Our ability to compete effectively and our future success depends on our continuing to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees In addition our compensation arrangements such as our equity award programs may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire mobilize or retain some of our global talent 22 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc In addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork As our organization grows and evolves we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our corporate culture and work environments to everchanging circumstances such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture We are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and in some instances our financial statements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over time The fair value of our investments may in the future be and certain investments have been in the past negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration or losses performance and financial results of the underlying entities foreign exchange rates changes in interest rates including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates the effect of new or changing regulations the stock market in general or other factors We measure certain of our nonmarketable equity and debt securities certain other instruments including stockbased compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination at fair value on a nonrecurring basis The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs requires management judgment and estimation and may change over time We adjust the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities to fair value for observable transactions of identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments All gains and losses on nonmarketable equity securities are recognized in other income expense which increases the volatility of our other income expense The unrealized gains and losses we record from fair value remeasurements of our nonmarketable equity securities in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately experience on such investments As a result of these factors the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents as well as our marketable and nonmarketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results We could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities Our future income taxes could be negatively affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program decreases in our stock price for shares paid as employee compensation changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including changes in the interpretation of existing laws as well as certain discrete items In addition we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities As a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions including in Europe on various taxrelated assertions such as transferpricing adjustments or permanentestablishment claims Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and could require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business It may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries resulting in the diversion of managements time and attention In addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made Furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that impair our financial results Various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering digital services taxes which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD continues to advance proposals relating to its initiative for modernizing international tax rules with the goal of having different countries implement a modernized and aligned international tax framework but there can be no guarantee that this will occur In addition in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the global spread of COVID19 legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may propose changes to their tax rules These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent 23 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc changes The effect of these potential new rules on us our longterm tax planning and our effective tax rate could be material The trading price for our Class A stock and nonvoting Class C stock may continue to be volatile The trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile In addition to the factors discussed in this report the trading price of our Class A stock and Class C stock have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including among others the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock regardless of our actual operating performance ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable ITEM 2 PROPERTIES Our headquarters are located in Mountain View California We also own and lease office and building space in the

financial condition and results of operations together with Note about ForwardLooking Statements Part I Item 1 Business Part I Item 1A Risk Factors and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K We have omitted discussion of 2019 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Item 7 of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10K Understanding Alphabets Financial Results Alphabet is a collection of businesses the largest of which is Google We report Google in two segments Google Services and Google Cloud we also report all nonGoogle businesses collectively as Other Bets Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business For further details on our segments see Part I Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect The following longterm trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results Users behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception contributing to revenue growth and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business Users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats Our users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities such as smartphones wearables and smart home devices and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business We are increasingly generating advertising revenues from different channels including mobile and newer advertising formats The margins on advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search Additionally as the market for a particular device type or modality matures our revenues may be affected For example growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors including increased market saturation in developed countries which can affect our mobile advertising revenue growth rates We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues TAC rate to be affected by changes in device mix geographic mix partner mix partner agreement terms the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points product mix the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels and revenue share terms We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our margins As online advertising evolves we continue to expand our product offerings which may affect our monetization As interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve these changing needs Over time we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate For example we have seen an increase in revenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play which monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads As users in developing economies increasingly come online our revenues from international markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues The shift to online as well as the advent of the multidevice world has brought opportunities outside of the US including in emerging markets such as India We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets This has led to a trend of increased revenues from emerging markets We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets particularly as lowcost mobile devices become more available This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets 28 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc International revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US dollar While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings The portion of revenues that we derive from nonadvertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins Nonadvertising revenues have grown over time We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud Google Play hardware products and YouTube subscriptions We currently derive nonadvertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and inapp purchases digital content products and hardware and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages and as such revenues from these businesses could be volatile In addition the margins on these revenues vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures We continue to make significant RD investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services Google Cloud and Other Bets We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets which includes servers and network equipment to support the longterm growth of our business In addition acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives For example in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit Inc for 21 billion which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions laws and public policies which could affect our business practices and financial results Changes in social political economic tax and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices As these global trends continue our cost of doing business may increase and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the US Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General the Digital Markets Act in Europe and various legislative proposals in the US focused on large technology platforms Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I Item 1 Business Seasonality and other Our advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage advertising expenditures and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality Additionally our nonadvertising revenues including those generated from Google Cloud Google Play hardware and YouTube may be affected by fluctuations driven by changes in pricing digital content releases fee structures new product and service launches other market dynamics as well as seasonality Revenues and Monetization Metrics Google Services Google Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising Google advertising as well as revenues from other sources Google other revenues Google Advertising Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following Google Search other which includes revenues generated on Google search properties including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Googlecom as their default search in browsers toolbars etc and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail Google Maps and Google Play YouTube ads which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties and 29 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Google Network which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob AdSense and Google Ad Manager We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues paid clicks and costperclick pertain to traffic on Google Search other properties while impressions and costperimpressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners properties Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by endusers on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail Google Maps and Google Play Costperclick is defined as clickdriven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob AdSense and Google Ad Manager Costperimpression is defined as impressionbased and clickbased revenues divided by our total number of impressions and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users As our business evolves we periodically review refine and update our methodologies for monitoring gathering and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity Our advertising revenue growth as well as the change in paid clicks and costperclick on Google Search other properties and the change in impressions and costperimpression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors including advertiser competition for keywords changes in advertising quality formats delivery or policy changes in device mix changes in foreign currency exchange rates fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs general economic conditions including the effect of COVID19 seasonality and traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels Google Other Google other revenues are comprised of the following Google Play which includes sales of apps and inapp purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store Devices and Services which includes sales of hardware including Fitbit wearable devices Google Nest home products and Pixel phones YouTube nonadvertising which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other products and services Google Cloud Google Cloud revenues are comprised of the following Google Cloud Platform which includes fees for infrastructure platform and other services Google Workspace which includes fees for cloudbased collaboration tools for enterprises such as Gmail Docs Drive Calendar and Meet and other enterprise services Other Bets Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services 30 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc For further details on how we recognize revenue see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components cost of revenues and operating expenses Our operating expenses include costs related to RD sales and marketing and general and administrative functions Certain of these expenses including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues TAC includes Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services Our distribution partners include browser providers mobile carriers original equipment manufacturers and software developers Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties Other cost of revenues includes Content acquisition costs which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee Expenses associated with our data centers including bandwidth compensation expenses depreciation energy and other equipment costs as well as other operations costs such as content review as well as customer and product support costs Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search other properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business which we categorize as either RD sales and marketing or general and administrative The main components of our RD expenses are compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for RD related to our existing and new products and services depreciation and professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing sales support and certain customer service functions and spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services The main components of our

driven by Google Services and Google Cloud The adverse effect of COVID19 on 2020 advertising revenues also contributed to the yearoveryear growth Cost of revenues was 1109 billion an increase of 31 primarily driven by increases in TAC and content acquisition costs An overall increase in data centers and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment Operating expenses were 680 billion an increase of 20 primarily driven by headcount growth increases in advertising and

Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information The Effect of COVID19 on our Financial Results We began to observe the effect of COVID19 on our financial results in March 2020 when despite an increase in users search activity our advertising revenues declined compared to the prior year This was due to a shift of user search activity to less commercial topics and reduced spending by our advertisers For the quarter ended June 30 2020 our advertising revenues declined due to the continued effects of COVID19 and the related reductions in global economic activity but we observed a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics This was followed by increased spending by our advertisers which continued throughout the second half of 2020 Additionally over the course of 2020 we experienced variability in our margins as many of our expenses are less variable in nature andor may not correlate to changes in revenues Market volatility contributed to fluctuations in the valuation of our equity investments Further our assessment of the credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the macroeconomic environment during the period was reflected in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable Throughout 2021 we remained focused on innovating and investing in the services we offer to consumers and businesses to support our longterm growth The impact of COVID19 on 2020 financial results affected yearoveryear growth trends The COVID19 pandemic continues to evolve be unpredictable and affect our

this Annual Report on Form 10K Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons We use nonGAAP constant currency revenues and nonGAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decisionmaking and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a yearonyear basis Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods These results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with GAAP Results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP 35 Table of Contents Alphabet

110939 Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 464 431 Cost of revenues increased 262 billion from 2020 to 2021 The increase was due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of 134 billion and 128 billion respectively The increase in TAC from 2020 to 2021 was due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network partners primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC The TAC rate decreased from 223 to 218 from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search other properties The TAC rate on Google Search other properties revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from 2020 to 2021 The increase in other cost of revenues from 2020 to 2021 was driven by increases in content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube data center and other operations costs and hardware costs The increase in data center and 36 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment beginning in the first quarter

development expenses as a percentage of revenues 151 123 RD expenses increased 40 billion from 2020 to 2021 The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses of 35 billion largely resulting from an 11 increase in headcount and an increase in professional service fees of 516 million This increase was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense of 450 million

billion from 2020 to 2021 primarily driven by an increase in advertising and promotional activities of 25 billion and an increase in compensation expenses of 22 billion The increase in advertising and promotional activities was driven by both increased spending in the current period and a reduction in spending in 2020 due to COVID19 The increase in compensation expenses was largely due to a 14

administrative expenses 11052 13510 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 61 52 General and administrative expenses increased 25 billion from 2020 to 2021 The increase was primarily driven by a 17 billion increase in charges relating to legal matters and a 664 million increase in compensation expenses largely resulting from a 14 increase in headcount These increases were partially offset by a reduction in expense of 808 million related to a decline in allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable as 2020 reflected a higher allowance related to the economic

government bonds corporate debt securities mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities and marketable equity securities Sources Uses of Cash and Related Trends Our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the longterm growth of the business

Activities Our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search other properties Google Network properties and YouTube ads Additionally we generate cash through sales of apps and inapp purchases digital content products and hardware and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscriptionbased products Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners for compensation and related costs and for content acquisition costs In addition uses of cash from operating activities include hardware inventory costs income taxes and other general corporate expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to the net effect of an increase in cash received from revenues and cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of our investments in marketable and nonmarketable securities Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and nonmarketable securities purchases of property and equipment and payments for acquisitions Net cash used in investing activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in maturities and sales of marketable securities an increase in purchases of property and equipment offset by a decrease in purchases of nonmarketable securities Cash Used in Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated entities Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of common and capital stock net payments related to stockbased award activities and repayments of debt Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to repayment of debt and an increase in cash payments for repurchases of common and capital stock Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements We expect existing

investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 39 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Capital Expenditures and Leases We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products Capital Expenditures Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories technical infrastructure which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing storage and networking requirements for ongoing business activities including machine learning collectively referred to as our information technology assets and data center land and building construction and office facilities ground up development projects and related building improvements Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service for our intended use The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years For example our data center construction projects are generally multiyear projects with multiple phases where we acquire qualified land and buildings construct buildings and secure and install information technology assets During the years ended December 31 2020 and 2021 we spent 223 billion and 246 billion on capital expenditures respectively Depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use Land is not depreciated For the years ended December 31 2020 and 2021 our depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were 129 billion and 116 billion respectively Leases For the years ended December 31 2020 and 2021 we recognized total operating lease assets of 28

ended December 31 2020 and 2021 our operating lease expenses including variable lease costs were 29 billion and 34 billion respectively Finance lease costs were not material for the years ended December 31 2020 and 2021 See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further information on leases Financing We have a shortterm debt financing program of up to 100 billion through the issuance of commercial paper which increased from 50 billion in September 2021 Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes As of December 31 2021 we had no commercial paper outstanding As of December 31 2021 we had 100 billion of revolving credit facilities with no amounts outstanding In April 2021 we terminated the existing revolving credit facilities which were scheduled to expire in July 2023 and entered into two new revolving credit facilities in the amounts of 40 billion and 60 billion which will expire in April 2022 and April 2026 respectively The interest rates for the new credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals No amounts have been borrowed under the new credit facilities As of December 31 2021 we have senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of 128 billion with shortterm and longterm future interest payments of 231 million and 40 billion respectively See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further information on our debt Share Repurchase Program In April 2021 the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to 500 billion of its Class C stock In July 2021 the Alphabet board approved an amendment to the April 2021 authorization permitting the company to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions including the relative trading 40 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares In accordance with the authorizations of the Board of Directors of Alphabet during 2021 we repurchased and subsequently retired 203 million aggregate shares for 503 billion Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired 12 million shares were Class A stock repurchased for 34 billion As of December 31 2021 174 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases under the amended authorization The repurchases are being executed from time to time subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions including through Rule 10b51 plans The repurchase program does not have an expiration date See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K European Commission Fines In 2017 2018 and 2019 the EC announced decisions that certain actions taken by Google infringed European competition law and imposed fines of 24 billion 27 billion as of June 27 2017 43 billion 51 billion as of June 30 2018 and 15 billion 17 billion as of March 20 2019 respectively While each EC decision is under appeal we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fines Taxes As of December 31 2021 we had shortterm and longterm income taxes payable of 784 million and 57 billion related to a onetime transition tax payable incurred as a result of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act As permitted by the Tax Act we will pay the transition tax in annual interestfree installments through 2025 We also have taxes payable of 35 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31 2021 Purchase Commitments We regularly enter into significant noncancelable contractual obligations primarily related to data center operations and buildouts information technology assets office buildings purchases of inventory and network capacity arrangements As of December 31 2021 such purchase commitments which do not qualify for recognition on our Consolidated Balance Sheets amount to 137 billion of which 119 billion is shortterm These amounts represent the noncancelable portion of agreements or the minimum cancellation fee For those agreements with variable terms we do not estimate the noncancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities andor pricing as of December 31 2021 Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP In doing so we have to make estimates and assumptions Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations Accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the audit and compliance committee of our Board of Directors See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements Fair Value Measurements of NonMarketable Equity Securities We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisting primarily of our nonmarketable equity securities These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative and are measured at cost less impairment subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer These adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities which may require the use of unobservable inputs Pricing adjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best information available which may include cash flow projections or other available market data Nonmarketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment based on qualitative factors including the companies financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources among others When indicators of impairment exist we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs including discount rates investee revenues and costs and comparable market data of private and public companies among others When our assessment indicates that an impairment exists we write down the investment to its fair value 41 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc We also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments ie performance fees We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and may require the use of unobservable inputs Property and Equipment We assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations changes in the planned use and utilization of assets or technological advancements that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the assets Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the US and foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes Recording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations including evaluation of comparable and resolved tax exposures applicability of tax laws and likelihood of settlement We evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically considering changes in facts and circumstances such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties In addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes Loss Contingencies We are regularly subject to claims suits regulatory and government investigations and other proceedings involving competition intellectual property privacy tax and related compliance labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms personal injury consumer protection and other matters Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K We evaluate on a regular basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters Until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material Change in Accounting Estimate In January 2021 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment In doing so we determined we should adjust the estimated useful life This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2021 and is detailed further in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity investment risks Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies International revenues as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar British pound Canadian dollar Euro and Japanese yen For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trends in 42 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 could be experienced in the near term We use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary These forward contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts If an adverse 10 foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets liabilities and commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date it would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approxima tely 497 million and 285 million as of December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended December 31 2020 and 2021 We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts including collars an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options to protect forecasted US dollarequivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates When the US dollar strengthens gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings When the US dollar weakens losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings These hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur I f the US dollar weakened by 10 as of December 31 2020 and 2021 the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately 912 million and 13 billion lower as of December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations If the US dollar weakened by 10 the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment CTA within AOCI related to our net investment hedge would have been approximately 10 billion lower as of both December 31 2020 and 2021 The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries Interest Rate Risk Our Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that w ill allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity We invest primarily in debt securities including those of the US government and its agencies corporate debt securities mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governments By policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense net We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold less any expected credit losses We use valueatrisk VaR analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable debt security portfolio The VaR is the expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates We use a variancecovariance VaR model with 95 confidence interval The estimated oneday loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31 2020 and 2021 are shown below in millions As of December 31 12Month Average As of December 31 2020 2021 2020 2021 Risk Category Interest Rate 144 139 145 148 43 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of December 31 2020 and 2021 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation Equity Investment Risk Our marketable and nonmarketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our nonmarketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages We record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility and represent 59 billion and 78 billion of our investments as of December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively A hypothetical adverse price change of 10 on our December 31 2021 balance which could be experienced in the near term would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by 780 million From time to time we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities Our nonmarketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment referred to as the measurement alternative The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date These investments especially those that are in the early stages are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a decline in financial condition which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings acquisitions private sales or other market events As of December 31 2020 and 2021 the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities which were accounted for under the measurement alternative was 189 billion and 276 billion respectively Valuations of our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant impairment charge relating to our nonmarketable equity securities Changes in valuation of nonmarketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities Additionally observable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses on our nonmarketable equity securities The effect of COVID19 on our impairment assessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the effect The carrying values of our equity method investments which totaled approximately 14 billion and 15 billion as of December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes However these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover For further information about our equity investments see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003 In 2015 we implemented a holding company reorganization and as a result Alphabet Inc Alphabet became the successor issuer to Google Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated Use of Estimates Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties including the effects of COVID19 On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to the allowance for credit losses fair values of financial instruments intangible assets and goodwill useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment income taxes and contingent liabilities among others We base our estimates on assumptions both historical and forward looking that are believed to be reasonable and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities In January 2021 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from three years to five years This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2021 Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31 2020 and those acquired during the year ended December 31 2021 the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of 26 billion and an increase in net income of 20 billion or 302 per basic share and 298 per diluted share for the year ended December 31 2021 Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues Advertising Revenues We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on Google Search and other properties including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Googlecom as their default search in browsers toolbars etc and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail Google Maps and Google Play YouTube properties and Google Network properties including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob AdSense and Google Ad Manager Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform among others We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement such as a click a view or a purchase For brand advertising we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed or a user views the ad For ads placed on Google Network properties we evaluate whether we are the principal ie report revenues on a gross basis or agent ie report revenues on a net basis Generally we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis that is the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues Where we are the principal we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing 54 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Google Cloud Revenues Google Cloud revenues consist of revenues from Google Cloud Platform which includes fees for infrastructure platform and other services Google Workspace which includes fees for cloudbased collaboration tools for enterprises such as Gmail Docs Drive Calendar and Meet and other enterprise services Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a year Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services based on the quantity of services consumed Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services Google Other Revenues Google other revenues consist of revenues from Google Play which includes sales of apps and inapp purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store hardware which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices Google Nest home products and Pixel phones YouTube nonadvertising which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other products and services As it relates to Google other revenues the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and inapp purchases through the Google Play store We report revenues from these transactions on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users for which we earn a service fee Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations For such arrangements we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin Customer Incentives and Credits Certain customers receive cashbased incentives or credits which are accounted for as variable consideration We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration Sales Commissions We expense sales commissions when incurred and when the amortization period the period of the expected benefit is one year or less We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues TAC includes Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services Our distribution partners include browser providers mobile carriers original equipment manufacturers and software developers Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties Other cost of revenues includes Content acquisition costs which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee 55 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Expenses associated with our data centers including bandwidth compensation expenses depreciation energy and other equipment costs as well as other operations costs such as content review as well as customer and product support costs Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell Software Development Costs We expense software development costs including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold leased or marketed to external users before technological feasibility is reached Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products As a result development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud based applications used to deliver our services We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented Stockbased Compensation Stockbased compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units RSUs RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date We recognize RSU expense using the straightline attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur For RSUs shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees As a result fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding and the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paidin capital Additionally stockbased compensation also includes other stockbased awards such as performance stock units PSUs that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets PSUs and certain Other Bet awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period Certain Other Bet awards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement The fair value of Other Bet awards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet Advertising and Promotional Expenses We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred For the years ended December 31 2019 2020 and 2021 advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately 68 billion 54 billion and 79 billion respectively Performance Fees Performance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and may require the use of unobservable inputs Performance fees are recorded as a component of other income expense net Fair Value Measurements Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants As such fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a threetier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets Level 2 Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data Where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates and credit ratings Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities 56 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents marketable securities derivative financial instruments and certain nonmarketable debt securities Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include nonmarketable equity securities Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed if required We measure certain other instruments including stockbased compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models Financial Instruments Our financial instruments include cash cash equivalents marketable and nonmarketable securities derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable Credit Risks We are subject to credit risk from cash equivalents marketable securities derivative financial instruments including foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness credit limits and use of collateral management Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend We generally do not require collateral from our customers Cash Equivalents We invest excess cash primarily in government bonds corporate debt securities mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities time deposits and money market funds Marketable Securities We classify all marketable debt securities that have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as availableforsale After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives as well as our liquidity requirements we may sell these debt securities prior to their stated maturities As we view these securities as available to support current operations we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets We carry these securities at fair value and report the unrealized gains and losses net of taxes as a component of stockholders equity except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses which are recorded in other income expense net For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense net We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income expense net Our investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses including unrealized recognized in other income expense net We classify our marketable equity securities subject to longterm lockup restrictions beyond twelve months as other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets NonMarketable Securities We account for nonmarketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method Our nonmarketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative Under the measurement alternative the carrying value is measured at cost less any impairment plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of other income expense net Nonmarketable debt securities are classified as availableforsale securities 57 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Nonmarketable securities that do not have stated contractual maturity dates are classified as other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Derivative Financial Instruments See Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments Accounts Receivable Our payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or services offered The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant For certain products or services and customers we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations We also consider customerspecific information current market conditions such as the effects caused by COVID19 and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions The allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable was 789 million and 550 million as of December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively Other Our financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also have commercial arrangements For these transactions judgment is required to assess the substance of the arrangements such as the market value of similar transactions or the fair value of the investment based on standalone transactions and whether the agreements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP Impairment of Investments We periodically review our debt and nonmarketable equity securities for impairment For debt securities in an unrealized loss position we determine whether a credit loss exists The credit loss is estimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other income expense net not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI If we have an intent to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of other income expense net For nonmarketable equity securities including equity method investments we consider whether impairment indicators exist by evaluating the companies financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources among other indicators If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired we write down the investment to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of other income expense net We prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach Inventory Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value Cost is computed using the firstin firstout method Variable Interest Entities We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity VIE We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP Periodically we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary 58 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Property and Equipment Property and equipment includes the following categories land and buildings information technology assets construction in progress leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures Land and buildings include land offices data centers and related building improvements Information technology assets include servers and network equipment We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation We compute depreciation using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which we regularly evaluate We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years We depreciate information technology assets generally over periods of four to five years generally four years for servers and five years for network equipment We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use Depreciation for equipment buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use Land is not depreciated Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception Our lease agreements generally contain lease and nonlease components Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed Nonlease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities We combine fixed payments for nonlease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities Certain lease agreements contain variable payments which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index payments contingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements and payments for maintenance and utilities Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in economic environments where the leased asset is located Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option We generally use the base noncancelable lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the longterm portion is included in operating lease liabilities Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment net Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or longterm debt Operating lease expense excluding variable lease costs is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term LongLived Assets Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets We review property and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value Impairments were not material for the periods presented We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination We evaluate our reporting units periodically as well as when changes in our operating segments occur For changes in reporting units we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired Goodwill impairments were no t material for the periods presented Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis generally over periods ranging from one to twelve years 59 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that based on technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority In addition we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision Business Combinations We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill Acquisitionrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred Foreign Currency We translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to US dollars using monthend exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average rates for the annual period derived from monthend exchange rates for revenues costs and expenses We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders equity We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency

Backlog and Deferred Revenues As of December 31 2021 we had 510 billion of remaining performance obligations revenue backlog primarily related to Google Cloud a nd expect to recognize approximately half of this amount as revenues over the next 24 months with the remaining thereafter Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recog nized as revenues The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such as revenues Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts We record deferred revenues when cash payments are

accounted for as availableforsale within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense net The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts Unrealized net gains losses related to debt securities still held where we

nonmarketable equity securities gains and losses on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity method Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets Our nonmarketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values The carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment referred to as the measurement alternative Nonmarketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility rights and obligations of the securities we hold The fair value of nonmarketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3 Gains and losses on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities Gains and losses reflected in other income expense net for marketable and nonmarketable equity securities are

Financial Instruments We enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations The primary risk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows earnings and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy We present our collar contracts an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options at net fair values where both the purchased and written options are with the same counterparty For other derivative contracts we present at gross fair values We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income expense net or revenues or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI as discussed below We enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty Further we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability Cash and noncash collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under

certain parties including advertisers Google Network partners customers of Google Cloud offerings lessors and service providers with respect to certain matters We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim In addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement Additionally we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position However to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period As of December 31 2021 we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible Legal Matters Antitrust Investigations On November 30 2010 the ECs Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrustrelated complaints against us On June 27 2017 the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law The EC decision imposed a 24 billion 27 billion as of June 27 2017 fine On September 11 2017 we appealed the EC decision to the General Court and on September 27 2017 we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the ECs decision We recognized a charge of 27 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017 On November 10 2021 the General Court rejected our appeal and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20 2022 On July 18 2018 the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Googles Androidrelated distribution agreements infringed European competition law The EC decision imposed a 43 billion 51 billion as of June 30 2018 fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue On October 9 2018 we appealed the EC decision On October 29 2018 we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices We recognized a charge of 51 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018 On March 20 2019 the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law The EC decision imposed a fine of 15 billion 17 billion as of March 20 2019 and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners agreements which we implemented prior to the decision On June 4 2019 we appealed the EC decision We recognized a charge of 17 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019 While each EC decision is under appeal we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fines 76 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition matters by regulatory authorities in the US Europe and other jurisdictions In August 2019 we began receiving civil investigative demands from the US Department of Justice DOJ requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20 2020 alleging that Google violated US antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising Separately on December 16 2020 a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated US antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology On June 22 2021 the EC opened a formal investigation into Googles advertising technology business practices On July 7 2021 a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Googles operation of Android and Google Play violated US antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws We believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously The DOJ and state Attorneys General continue their investigations into certain aspects of our business We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the US the EC and other regulators around the world Patent and Intellectual Property Claims We have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe others intellectual property rights Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services As a result we may have to change our business practices and develop noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business In addition the US International Trade Commission ITC has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the US Because the US is an important market a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important products into the US or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products Furthermore many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property infringement claims which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims In addition our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business In 2010 Oracle America Inc Oracle brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California alleging that Googles Android operating system infringes Oracles copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces Java APIs After trial final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8 2016 and the court decided posttrial motions in favor of Google Oracle appealed and on March 27 2018 the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages On May 29 2018 we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit and on August 28 2018 the Federal Circuit denied the petition On January 24 2019 we filed a petition to the US Supreme Court to review the case On April 29 2019 the Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition On September 27 2019 the Solicitor General recommended denying our petition and we provided our response on October 16 2019 On November 15 2019 the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in our case on October 7 2020 On April 5 2021 the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuits ruling and found that Googles use of the Java APIs was a fair use as a matter of law The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Federal Circuit for further proceedings in conformity with the Supreme Court opinion On May 14 2021 the Federal Circuit entered an order affirming the district courts final judgment in favor of Google On June 21 2021 the Federal Circuit issued a mandate returning the case to the district court and the case is now concluded Other We are also regularly subject to claims suits regulatory and government investigations other proceedings and consent decrees involving competition intellectual property privacy tax and related compliance labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms personal injury consumer protection and other matters For example we have a number of privacy

or other adverse consequences all of which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results 77 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the reasonably possible loss We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments as appropriate Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters With respect to our outstanding matters based on our current knowledge we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows However the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred NonIncome Taxes We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to nonincome tax matters The subject matter of nonincome tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits We accrue nonincome taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the reasonably possible loss Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations For information regarding income tax contingencies see Note 14 Note 11 Stockholders Equity Preferred Stock Our Board of Directors has authorized 100 million shares of preferred stock 0001 par value issuable in series As of December 31 2020 and 2021 no shares were issued or outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock Our Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical except with respect to voting Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share Class C capital stock has no voting rights except as required by applicable law Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock Share Repurchases In April 2021 the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to 500 billion of its Class C stock In July 2021 the Alphabet board approved an amendment to the April 2021 authorization permitting the company to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares As of December 31 2021 174 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases under the amended authorization In accordance with the authorizations of the Board of Directors of Alphabet during the years ended December 31 2020 and 2021 we repurchased and subsequently retired 215 million and 203 million aggregate shares for 311 billion and 503 billion respectively Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during 2021 12 million shares were Class A stock for 34 billion Stock Split Effected in Form of Stock Dividend Stock Split On February 1 2022 the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20forone stock split in the form of a onetime special stock dividend on each share of the Companys Class A Class B and Class C stock The Stock Split is subject to stockholder approval of an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A Class B and Class C stock to accommodate the Stock Split 78 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc If approval is obtained each of the Companys stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1 2022 the Record Date will receive after the close of business on July 15 2022 a dividend of 19 additional shares of the same class of stock for every share held by such stockholder as of the Record Date Note 12 Net Income Per Share We compute net income per share of Class A Class B and Class C stock using the twoclass method Basic net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of shares outstanding during the period Diluted net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares The rights including the liquidation and dividend rights of the holders of our Class A Class B and Class C stock are identical except with respect to voting Furthermore there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation as well as Delaware law which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A Class B and Class C stock Specifically Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights powers or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment In addition our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors As a result the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A Class B and Class C stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis In the years ended December 31 2019 2020 and 2021 the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A Class B and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc The following

taxes 11 11 10 Effective tax rate 133 162 162 Our effective tax rate for 2019 was affected significantly by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate because substantially all of the income from foreign operations was earned by an Irish subsidiary As of December 31 2019 we have simplified our corporate legal entity structure and now license intellectual property from the US that was previously licensed from Bermuda resulting in an increase in the portion of our income earned in the US On July 27 2015 the US Tax Court in an opinion in Altera Corp v Commissioner invalidated the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring relatedparty participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stockbased compensation costs The US Tax Court issued the final decision on December 28 2015 As a result of that decision we recorded a tax benefit related to the anticipated reimbursement of cost share payment for previously shared stockbased compensation costs On June 7 2019 the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the 2015 Tax Court decision in Altera Corp v Commissioner and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring relatedparty participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stockbased compensation costs As a result of the Ninth Circuit court decision our cumulative net tax benefit of 418 million related to previously shared stockbased compensation costs was reversed in the year ended December 31 2019 In 2020 there was an increase in valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized relating to certain of our Other Bets 82 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows in millions As of December 31 2020 2021 Deferred tax assets Accrued employee benefits 580 549 Accruals and reserves not currently deductible 1049 1816 Tax credits 3723 5179 Net operating losses 1085 1790 Operating leases 2620 2503 Intangible assets 1525 2034 Other 981 925 Total deferred tax assets 11563 14796

leases 2354 2228 Other 1580 946 Total deferred tax liabilities 9217 11640 Net deferred tax assets liabilities 2477 3973 As of December 31 2021 our federal state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately 56 billion 46 billion and 17 billion respectively If not utilized the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2023 foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 It is more likely than not that certain net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance against them The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions As of December 31 2021 our California RD carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately 50 billion that can be carried over indefinitely We believe the state tax credit is not likely to be realized As of December 31 2021 our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were approximately 700 million and will begin to expire in 2025 We use the flowthrough method of accounting for investment tax credits We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized As of December 31 2021 we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets certain federal net operating losses certain state tax credits net deferred tax assets relating to certain Other Bets and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized We continue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly 83 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Uncertain Tax Positions The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits in millions Year Ended December 31 2019 2020 2021 Beginning gross unrecognized tax benefits 4652 3377 3837 Increases related to prior year tax positions 938 372 529 Decreases related to prior year tax positions

total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was 34 billion 38 billion and 52 billion as of December 31 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively of which 23 billion 26 billion and 37 billion if recognized would affect our effective tax rate respectively As of December 31 2020 and 2021 we accrued 222 million and 270 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes respectively We file income tax returns in the US federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions Our two major tax jurisdictions are the US federal and Ireland We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented The tax years 2014 through 2020 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations However the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs Although the timing of resolution settlement and closure of audits is not certain it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain US federal state and non US tax positions could decrease by approximately 20 billion in the next 12 months Positions that may be resolved include various US and nonUS matters Note 15 Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as Google Services Google Cloud and Other Bets Google Services

Contents Alphabet Inc ITEM 9 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10K Based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of December 31 2021 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating results In 2019 we began a multiyear implementation of a new global ERP system which will replace much of our existing core financial systems The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records enhance the flow of financial information improve data management and provide timely information to our management team The implementation is expected to continue in phases over the next few years We completed the implementation of certain of our subledgers which included changes to our processes procedures and internal controls over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2021 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting However as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues we will change our processes and procedures which in turn could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting As such changes occur we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting As a result of COVID19 our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for the quarter ended December 31 2021 While we continue to evolve our work model in response to the uneven effects of the ongoing pandemic around the world we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting continue to be eff ective We have continued to reevaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide reasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and in a timely manner Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a15f of the Exchange Act Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework Based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31 2021 Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2021 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives In addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures
