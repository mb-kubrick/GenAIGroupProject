context indicates otherwise Alphabet Google and other trademarks of ours appearing in this report are our property We do not intend our use or display of other companies trade names or trademarks to imply an endorsement or sponsorship of us by such companies or any relationship with any of these companies PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS Overview As our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders letter Google is not a conventional company We do not intend to become one That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and since 2016 an AIfirst company We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai Alphabet is a collection of businesses the largest of which is Google We report Google in two segments Google Services and Google Cloud and all nonGoogle businesses collectively as Other Bets Alphabets structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence Access and Technology for Everyone The Internet is one of the worlds most powerful equalizers it propels ideas people and businesses large and small Our mission to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998 Since then we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done We are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge health happiness and success Google Search helps people find information and make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways with trillions of searches on Google every year YouTube provides people with entertainment information and opportunities to learn something new Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices providing intelligent help throughout a persons day no matter where they are Google Cloud helps customers solve todays business challenges improve productivity reduce costs and unlock new growth engines We are continually innovating and building new products and features that will help our users partners customers and communities and have invested more than 150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts Making AI Helpful for Everyone AI is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across the world and for our business At Google we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a decade and making them available to our users Our journey began in 2001 when machine learning was first incorporated into Google Search to suggest better spellings to users searching the web Today AI in our products is 4 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc used by billions of people globally through features like autocomplete suggestions in Google Search translation across 133 languages in Google Translate and organization searching and editing in Google Photos Large language models LLMs are an exciting aspect of our work in AI based on deep learning architectures such as the Transformer a neural network architecture that we introduced in 2017 that helped with language understanding This led to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers or BERT in 2019 that helped Search understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before Google was a company built in the cloud and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AIoptimized infrastructure mature AI platform and worldclass models and assistive agents We believe AI can solve some of the hardest societal scientific and engineering challenges of our time For example in 2020 Google DeepMinds AlphaFold system solved a 50yearold protein folding challenge Since then we have opensourced to the scientific community 200 million of AlphaFolds protein structures which are used to work on everything from accelerating new malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plasticeating enzymes As another example AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful information predicting climaterelated events and optimizing climate action Using advanced AI and geospatial analysis Google Research has developed flood forecasting models that can provide early warning and realtime flooding information to communities and individuals As AI continues to improve rapidly we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we deliver on our mission to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful With a bold and responsible approach we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone Deliver the Most Advanced Safe and Responsible AI We aim to build the most advanced safe and responsible AI with models that are developed trained and rigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure In December 2023 we launched Gemini our most capable and general model It was built from the ground up to be multimodal which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand operate across and combine different types of information including text code audio images and video Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini as well as other AI models we have previously developed and announced across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users advertisers partners customers and developers We believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible That means developing AI in a way that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges guided by our AI Principles We published these in 2018 as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use users safety and avoidance of harms above business considerations While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible we believe it is possible and in fact critical to embrace that tension productively Enable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud AI is not only a powerful enabler it is also a major platform shift Globally businesses from startups to large enterprises and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation That is why we are focused on making it easy and scalable for others to innovate and grow with AI That means providing the most advanced computing infrastructure and expanding access to Googles latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our own products Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train tune augment and deploy applications using generative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations Duet AI for Google Cloud provides prepackaged AI agents that assist developers to write test document and operate software Improve Knowledge Learning Creativity and Productivity Things that we now consider routine like spell check mobile check deposit or Google Search Google Translate and Google Maps all use AI As AI continues to improve rapidly we are focused on giving helpful features to our users as we continue to deliver on our mission to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful While we have been integrating AI into our products for years we are now embedding the power of generative AI to continue helping our users express themselves and get things done For example Duet AI in Google Workspace helps users write organize visualize accelerate workflows and have richer meetings Bard allows users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities coding support and app integration Dream Screen a new experimental feature in YouTube allows for the creation of AIgenerated video or image backgrounds to Shorts by typing an idea into a prompt 5 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc We also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses and we make that even easier with AI With Performance Max advertisers simply tell us their campaign goals and share their creative assets and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across all of Googles properties to meet their budget Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes helping them easily create uniquelytailored imagery featuring their products for free Additionally we are experimenting with Search and Shopping ads that are directly integrated into the AIpowered snapshot and conversational mode in Search Generative Experience Build the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices Over the years our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on top of it Our latest Pixel devices were built around AI bringing the best AIassistive experiences to our users such as Best Take Magic Editor and Audio Magic Eraser As we look ahead we are designing our Android and Chrome operating systems with new AIforward user experiences Moonshots Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done making only incremental changes This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time especially in technology where change tends to be revolutionary not evolutionary People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser Our early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to future developments We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term most notably for the application of AI to our products and services as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing As we said in the original founders letter we will not shy away from highrisk highreward projects that we believe in as they are the key to our longterm success Privacy and Security We make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products users and customers even if there are nearterm financial consequences We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default strictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design and building easytouse settings that put people in control We are continually enhancing these efforts over time whether by enabling users to autodelete their data giving them tools such as My Ad Center to control their ad experience or advancing antimalware antiphishing and password security features Google For reporting purposes Google comprises two segments Google Services and Google Cloud Google Services Serving Our Users We have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people worldwide Our product innovations are what make our services widely used and our brand one of the most recognized in the world Google Services core products and platforms include ads Android Chrome devices Gmail Google Drive Google Maps Google Photos Google Play Search and YouTube with broad and growing adoption by users around the world Our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago While Google Search started as a way to find web pages organized into ten blue links we have driven technical advancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic multimodal experience We first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search making it easier to navigate on smaller screens As new types of content surfaced on the internet Universal Search made it possible to search multiple content types like news images videos and more to deliver rich relevant results The introduction of new search modalities like voice and visual search made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive ways We took that a step further with multisearch which lets people search with text and images at the same time Large language models like BERT and Multitask Unified Models or MUMs have made it possible to express more natural language queries vastly improving the quality of results Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people to find what they are looking for This drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube People are consuming many forms of digital content including watching videos streaming TV playing games listening to music 6 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc reading books and using apps Working with content creators and partners we continue to build new ways for people around the world to create and find great digital content Fueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices That is why we continue to invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system Chrome browser and Chrome operating system as well as growing our family of devices We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make peoples lives easier by combining the best of our AI software and hardware This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices such as the new Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro and the Pixel Watch 2 Creating products and services that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the longterm How We Make Money We have built worldclass advertising technologies for advertisers agencies and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies AI has been foundational to our advertising business for more than a decade Products like Performance Max and Product Studio use the full power of our AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities Google Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on Google Search other properties YouTube and Google Network partners properties Google Network properties We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with advertisers Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple textbased ads Brand advertising helps enhance users awareness of and affinity for advertisers products and services through videos text images and other interactive ads that run across various devices We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brandbuilding marketing campaigns We have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways including filtering out invalid traffic removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year and closely monitoring the sites apps and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content In addition Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising including consumer subscriptions which primarily include revenues from YouTube services such as YouTube TV YouTube Music and Premium and NFL Sunday Ticket as well as Google One platforms which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and inapp purchases and devices which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices Google Cloud Through our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumptionbased fees and subscriptions for infrastructure platform collaboration tools and other cloud services Customers use five key capabilities from Google Cloud AIoptimized Infrastructure provides open reliable and scalable compute networking and storage to enable customers to run workloads anywhere on our Cloud at the edge or in their data centers It can be used to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train

applications using generative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations Duet AI for Google Cloud provides prepackaged AI agents that assist developers to write test document and operate software Other Bets Across Alphabet we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries from improving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change Alphabets investment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development ranging from those in the RD phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization Our goal is for them to become thriving successful businesses Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors While these earlystage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcarerelated services and internet services Competition Our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business including among others from general purpose search engines and information services vertical search engines and ecommerce providers for queries related to travel jobs and health which users may navigate directly to rather than go through Google online advertising platforms and networks other forms of advertising such as billboards magazines newspapers radio and television as our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media both online and offline digital content and application platform providers providers of enterprise cloud services developers and providers of AI products and services companies that design manufacture and market consumer hardware products including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms providers of digital video services social networks which users may rely on for product or service referrals rather than seeking information through traditional search engines providers of workspace communication and connectivity products and digital assistant providers Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses For example for advertising competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining users for whom other products and services are literally one click away largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising as well as the general usefulness security and availability of our products and services advertisers primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads and ultimately customers and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels and content providers primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising and the terms of our agreements with them 8 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc For additional information about competition see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10K Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet Sustainability is one of our core values at Google and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do We have been a leader on sustainability and climate change since Googles founding more than 25 years ago Our sustainability work is focused on empowering individuals to take action working together with our partners and customers and working to reduce our carbon footprint across our operations and supply chain In 2020 we shared our aspiration to help individuals cities and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030 This is an ambitious vision that we have set to push us to contribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain In 2021 we set an ambitious goal to achieve netzero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030 To accomplish this we aim to reduce 50 of our combined Scope 1 Scope 2 marketbased and Scope 3 absolute emissions versus our 2019 baseline before 2030 and plan to invest in naturebased and technologybased carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions We have formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target One of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy Since 2017 we have matched 100 of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an annual basis However because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind across the regions where we operateand because of the variable supply of these resourceswe still need to rely on carbonemitting energy sources that power local grids That is why we set a goal to run on 247 carbonfree energy CFE on every grid where we operate by 2030 Achieving netzero emissions and 247 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals We also know that our path to netzero emissions will not be easy or linear Some of our plans may take years to deliver results particularly where they involve building new largescale infrastructure with long lead times So as our business continues to evolve we expect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target To benefit the people and places where we operate we have set goals to replenish 120 of the freshwater volume we consume on average across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the quality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate We also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations products and supply chains Our circularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start keeping materials in use for as long as possible and promoting healthy materialsfor our data centers workplaces and products More

healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work and we communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees When necessary we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not have appropriate inhouse expertise or resources often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations content moderation customer support and physical security We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when we need to cover shortterm leaves when we have spikes in business needs or when we need to quickly incubate special projects We choose our partners and staffing agencies carefully and review their compliance with Googles Supplier Code of Conduct We continually make improvements to promote a respectful and positive working environment for everyone employees vendors and temporary staff alike Government Regulation We are subject to numerous United States US federal state and local as well as foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects and the scope of this coverage continues to broaden with continuing new legal and regulatory developments in the US and internationally Like other companies in the technology industry we face increasingly heightened scrutiny from both US and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain Particularly with regard to AI climate change and sustainability competition consumer protection content moderation data privacy and security news publications and reporting on human capital and diversity we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and regulations as well as related enforcement actions and investigations being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the world Our compliance with these

subject to various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described below which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results and affect the trading price of our Class A and Class C stock Risks Specific to our Company We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising Reduced spending by advertisers a loss of partners or new and existing technologies that block ads online andor affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business We generated more than 75 of total revenues from online advertising in 2023 Many of our advertisers companies that distribute our products and services digital publishers and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value such as increased numbers of users or customers new sales leads increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternatives Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices such as our initiatives to phase out thirdparty cookies as well as changes to other companies advertising andor data privacy practices have in the past and may in the future affect the advertising that we are able to provide In addition technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of thirdparty digital advertising Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results In addition expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions Adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected and may in the future affect the demand for advertising resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising which could harm our financial condition and operating results We face intense competition If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users customers and other partners we may not remain competitive which could harm our business financial condition and operating results Our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive Our businesses face changing technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of rival products and services To compete successfully we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative relevant and useful products services and technologies in a timely manner As our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and RD including through acquisitions in order to enhance our technology products and services We have many competitors in different industries Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging startups Some competitors have longer operating histories and wellestablished relationships in various sectors They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic arrangements continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure RD and in talent initiating intellectual property and competition claims whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete for users advertisers customers and content providers Further discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny thereby affording them competitive advantages Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before we do We are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company This includes generative AI and continuing to integrate AI capabilities into our products and services AI technology and services are highly competitive rapidly evolving and require significant investment including development and operational costs to meet the changing needs and expectations of our existing users and attract new users Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for our products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of thirdparty equipment and technical infrastructure Additionally other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or more costeffective to deploy Other companies may also have or in the future may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use or sell our own AI products and services Our financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the evolving needs and desires of our users advertisers publishers customers and content providers As new and existing technologies continue to develop competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are or 11 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours These technologies could reduce usage of our products and services and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products and services Competitors success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users advertisers publishers customers and content providers could harm our financial condition and operating results Our ongoing investment in new businesses products services and technologies is inherently risky and could divert management attention and harm our business financial condition and operating results We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies in a wide range of industries beyond online advertising The investments that we are making across our businesses such as building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are helpful to users advertisers publishers customers and content providers Our investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and in pursuing new strategies we may incur unanticipated liabilities Innovations in our products and services could also result in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue trends These endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations different monetization models and the use of alternative investment governance or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives Within Google Services we continue to invest heavily in devices including our smartphones home devices and wearables which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors increased market saturation in developed countries short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in performance characteristics and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses There can be no assurance we will be able to provide devices that compete effectively Within Google Cloud we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterpriseready cloud services including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to support these tools and technologies We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services invest in cybersecurity and hire talent particularly to support and scale our sales force At the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services Pricing and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives Further our business with public sector customers may present additional risks including regulatory compliance risks For instance we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal financial andor reputational risks Evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments build new products and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements Within Other Bets we are investing significantly in the areas of health life sciences and transportation among others These investment areas face intense competition from large experienced and wellfunded competitors and our offerings many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies may not be successful or be able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability In addition new and evolving products and services including those that use AI raise ethical technological legal regulatory and other challenges which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation financial condition and operating results Our revenue growth rate could decline over time and we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin in the future Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors including changes in the devices and modalities used to access our products and services changes in geographic mix deceleration or declines in advertiser spending competition customer usage and demand for our products decreases in our pricing of our products and services ongoing product and policy changes and shifts to lower priced products and services In addition we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors such as an increase in the mix of lowermargin products and services in particular from the continued expansion of our business into new fields including products and services such as our devices Google Cloud and consumer subscription products as well as significant investments in Other Bets all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising In particular margins on our devices have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales We may also experience 12 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations increasing competition and increasing costs for many aspects of our business Further certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue We may also not be able to execute our efforts to reengineer our cost base successfully or in a timely manner Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance For additional information see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands as well as affect our ability to compete Our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products services and technologies For example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet Also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations Moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets We also face risks associated with our trademarks For example there is a risk that the word Google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search Some courts have ruled that Google is a protectable trademark but it is possible that other courts particularly those outside of the US may reach a different determination If this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word Google to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brand Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete Also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results Our business depends on strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users advertisers customers content providers and other partners Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Services Google Cloud and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users advertisers customers content providers and other partners Our brands have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a number of factors including among others reputational issues thirdparty content shared on our platforms data privacy and security issues and developments and product or technical performance failures For example if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services andor products or objectionable practices by advertisers or otherwise to adequately address user concerns our users may lose confidence in our brands Furthermore failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality trustworthy innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business financial condition and operating results We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our services We rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices and servers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to assemble the devices and equipment We also rely on other companies to participate in the supply of components and distribution of our products and services Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage fail to meet their 13 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them We have experienced andor may in the future experience supply shortages price increases quality issues andor longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations driven by raw material component availability manufacturing capacity labor shortages industry allocations logistics capacity inflation foreign currency exchange rates tariffs sanctions and export controls trade disputes and barriers forced labor concerns sustainability sourcing requirements geopolitical tensions armed conflicts natural disasters or pandemics the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns associated with wildfire prevention and increased storm severity power loss and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers Some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our devices are available from only one or limited sources and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption A significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability We may enter into longterm contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand technological change changed consumer preferences quality product recalls and warranty issues For instance because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volumebased pricing or minimum purchase requirements if the volume of sales of our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our financial condition and operating results Furthermore certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply Our devices have had and in the future may have quality issues resulting from design manufacturing or operations Sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective or require a recall it could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and where applicable our company policies and practices such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct regarding workplace and employment practices data security environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions canceled orders harm to key relationships and damage to our reputation Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims Interruption to interference with or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services which could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems Our systems are vulnerable to damage interference or interruption from modifications or upgrades terrorist attacks statesponsored attacks natural disasters or pandemics geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts export controls and

schemes or other attempts to harm or access our systems Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters Our data centers are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism and in some cases to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area Some of our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic closure of a facility or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service In addition our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past and may contain in the future errors or vulnerabilities which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems Any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from effectively offering products and providing services which could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business financial condition and operating results 14 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income and we plan to continue to grow internationally International revenues accounted for approximately 53 of our consolidated revenues in 2023 In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the following restrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the US sanctions import and export controls other market access barriers political unrest geopolitical tensions changes in regimes or armed conflict such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine any of which may affect our business continuity increase our operating costs limit demand for our products and services limit our ability to source components or final products or prevent or impede us from operating in certain jurisdictions complying with local laws or offering products or services longer payment cycles in some countries increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to litigation new regulatory costs and challenges including new customer requirements uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent anticorruption laws such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties and different employeeemployer relationships existence of works councils and differing labor practices and other challenges caused by distance language local expertise and cultural differences increasing the complexity of doing business in multiple jurisdictions Because we conduct business in currencies other than US dollars but report our financial results in US dollars we have faced and will continue to face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results We are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and in some instances our financial statements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies The fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be and certain investments have been in the past negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration or losses performance and financial results of the underlying entities foreign exchange rates changes in interest rates including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates the effect of new or changing regulations the stock market in general or other factors We measure certain of our nonmarketable equity and debt securities certain other instruments including stockbased compensation awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination at fair value on a nonrecurring basis which is inherently subjective and requires management judgment and estimation All gains and losses on nonmarketable equity securities are recognized in OIE which increases the volatility of our OIE The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value remeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such investments As a result of these factors the value of our investments could decline which could harm our financial condition and operating results Risks Related to our Industry People access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our

only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices In addition search queries may be undertaken via voiceactivated search apps 15 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc social media or other platforms which could harm our business It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers suppliers distributors developers and users or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms could harm our business financial condition and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure Our evolving AIrelated efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content inaccuracies discrimination intellectual property infringement or misappropriation defamation data privacy cybersecurity and other issues As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm regulatory action legal liability including under new and proposed legislation and regulations new applications of existing data protection privacy intellectual property and other laws and brand or reputational harm Some uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society In order to implement AI responsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant resources to develop test and maintain our products and services but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AIrelated issues deficiencies andor failures before they arise Unintended consequences uses or customization of our AI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights privacy employment or other social concerns which may result in claims lawsuits brand or reputational harm and increased regulatory scrutiny any of which could harm our business financial

potential users or customers from using our products and services Computer viruses software bugs or defects security breaches and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users and customers ability to use our products and services harming our business and reputation Concerns about including the adequacy of our practices with regard to the collection use governance disclosure or security of personal data or other dataprivacyrelated matters even if unfounded could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change Our products and services involve the storage handling and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information Software bugs theft misuse defects vulnerabilities in our products and services and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities including regulatory fines and penalties as well as reputational harm Additionally our products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies and thus our technologies and software have contained and are likely in the future to contain undetected errors bugs andor vulnerabilities We continue to add new features involving AI to our offerings and internal systems and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our and the markets understanding of AIcentric security risks and protection methods continue to develop We have in the past discovered and may in the future discover some errors in our software code only after we have released the code Systems and control failures security breaches failure to comply with our privacy policies andor inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure seriously harm our reputation brand and business and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs theft misuse and security vulnerabilities or breaches We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis Cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time We have seen and will continue to see industrywide software supply chain vulnerabilities which could affect our or other parties systems We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack In addition we face the risk of cyber attacks by nationstates and statesponsored actors These attacks may target us or our customers particularly our public sector customers including federal state and local governments Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine may increase these risks We may experience security issues whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties systems While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the 16 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc time they occur and may remedy them quickly there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal financial and reputational harm including government inquiries enforcement actions litigation and negative publicity There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target even taking all reasonable precautions including those required by law we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures Further if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate datasecurity practices fail to comply with our terms and policies or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners or service providers security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would be harmed we could lose users and customers our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks including legal claims which may include classaction litigation and regulatory actions fines and penalties Any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results While we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities including dedicated worldwide incident response teams our response process particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic may not be adequate may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident As a result we may suffer significant legal reputational or financial exposure which could harm our business financial condition and operating results For additional information see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under Risks Related to Laws Regulations and

mitigate cyber attacks we are making significant investments in safety security and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties including investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services As a result of these efforts we have in the past discovered and may in the future discover incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties However we may not have discovered and may in the future not discover all such incidents or activity whether as a result of our data limitations including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services the scale of activity on our platform or other factors including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third parties Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies the existence of false or undesirable user accounts election interference improper ad purchases activities that threaten peoples safety on or

publicity There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement harm our reputation and brands require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations and adversely affect our business and financial results Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in monetary penalties and damages divert managements time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight Problematic content on our platforms including lowquality usergenerated content web spam content farms and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services which could harm our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services We like others in the industry face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent While we invest significantly in efforts to promote highquality and relevant results and to detect and prevent lowquality content and invalid traffic we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote 17 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc uniformly highquality content Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of abuse for bad actors Many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engines assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them Such efforts have affected and may continue to affect the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false misleading or undesirable content Although Englishlanguage web spam in our search results has been reduced and web spam in most other languages is limited we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful and our users may have negative experiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended which may affect our users decisions in continuing to use our platforms We also face other challenges from lowquality and irrelevant content websites including content farms which are websites that generate large quantities of lowquality content to help them improve their search rankings We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from lowquality websites but we may not always be successful We also face other challenges on our platforms including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference activities that threaten the safety andor wellbeing of our users on or offline and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation If we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote highquality content it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms harming our financial condition and operating results It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions

access providers may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively Currently this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace including incumbent telephone companies cable companies mobile communications companies and governmentowned service providers Some of these providers have taken or have stated that they may take measures that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings or by providing our competitors preferential access Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers however substantial uncertainty exists in the US and elsewhere regarding such protections For example in 2018 the US Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules which could permit internet access providers to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services In addition in some jurisdictions our products and services have been subject to governmentinitiated restrictions or blockages These could harm existing key relationships including with our users customers advertisers andor content providers and impair our ability to attract new ones harm our reputation and increase costs thereby negatively affecting our business Risks Related to Laws Regulations and Policies We are subject to a variety of new existing and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business We are subject to numerous US and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects and our introduction of new businesses products services and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws and regulations In recent years governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy particularly in the areas of data privacy and security competition environmental social and governance ESG requirements AI and online content The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future New or changing laws and regulations or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices have resulted in and may continue to result in less useful products and services altered business practices limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services substantial costs and civil or criminal liability Examples include laws and regulations

under consideration in a range of jurisdictions AI Laws and regulations focused on the development use and provision of AI technologies and other digital products and services which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions For example while legislative text has yet to be finalized and formally approved provisional political agreement on a proposed EU AI Act was reached between colegislators in December 2023 including that specific transparency and other requirements would be introduced for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are based In addition the White Houses Executive Order on the Safe Secure and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence devises a framework for the US government among other things to regulate private sector use and development of certain foundation models Data privacy collection and processing Laws and regulations further restricting the collection processing andor sharing of user or

transfers including data localization laws Copyright and other intellectual property Copyright and related laws including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions which may introduce new licensing regimes increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers which may result in other regulatory actions Content moderation Various laws covering content moderation and removal and related disclosure obligations such as the EUs Digital Services Act Floridas Senate Bill 7072 and Texas House Bill 20 and laws and proposed legislation in Singapore Australia and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with lowquality deceptive or harmful content Consumer protection Consumer protection laws including the EUs New Deal for Consumers which could result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations In addition the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations as interpreted by courts regulators or administrative bodies remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business For example we rely on statutory safe harbors like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the US and the ECommerce Directive in Europe to protect against liability for various linking caching ranking recommending and hosting activities Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the US EU and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms Our development use and commercialization of AI products and services including our implementation of AI in our offerings and internal systems could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability including under specific legislation regulating AI as well as new applications of existing data protection cybersecurity privacy intellectual property and other laws We are and may continue to be subject to claims lawsuits regulatory and government investigations enforcement

antitrust laws related to Google Plays billing practices The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024 and the range of potential remedies vary widely We plan to appeal In addition the US Department of Justice various US states and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business including our advertising technologies and practices the operation and distribution of Google Search and the operation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store Other regulatory agencies in the US and around the world including competition enforcers consumer protection agencies and data protection authorities have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations We are

our business models and operations including divestiture and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences all of which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results Any of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs diversion of management resources negative publicity and other harms to our business Estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex factspecific and speculative process that requires significant judgment and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or exceed our estimates The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in and may in the future result in additional substantial fines penalties injunctions and other sanctions that could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results For additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject see Legal Proceedings in Part I Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Privacy data protection and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas Any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results Authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection data usage and encryption of user data Adverse legal rulings legislation or regulation have resulted in and may continue to result in fines and orders requiring that we change our practices which have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services harming our business reputation financial condition and operating results These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation and compliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business Examples of these laws include The General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations which apply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom respectively or related to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers respectively or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK respectively Various comprehensive US state and foreign privacy laws which give new data privacy rights to their respective residents including in California a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices and impose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data State laws governing the processing of biometric information such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act and the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act which impose obligations on businesses that collect or disclose consumer biometric information Various federal state and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to children and minors including the collection and processing of children and minors data These include the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the United Kingdom AgeAppropriate Design Code all of which address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on online services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children The California Internet of Things Security Law which regulates the security of data used in connection with internetconnected devices The EUs Digital Markets Act which will require inscope companies to obtain user consent for combining data across certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies among other changes 20 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Further we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive personal data as well as ongoing enforcement actions from supervisory authorities related to crossborder transfers of personal data The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we currently rely upon remains subject to legal regulatory and political developments in both Europe and the US which may require us to adapt our existing arrangements We face and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend result in significant damage awards or other costs including indemnification awards and limit our ability to use certain technologies We like other internet technology and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights including patent copyright trade secrets and trademarks Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in US and international courts and the US International Trade Commission ITC for exclusion and ceaseanddesist orders In addition patentholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us As we continue to expand our business the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products services and technologies Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements if licenses are available at all or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the US or elsewhere including by preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services in certain jurisdictions They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business Many of our agreements with our customers and partners including certain suppliers require us to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and harm our business Moreover intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers when obtainable may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims Furthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities including those associated with intellectual property claims Regardless of their merits intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle To the extent such claims are successful they could harm our business including our product and service offerings financial condition and operating results Expectations relating to ESG considerations could expose us to potential liabilities increased costs and reputational harm We are subject to laws regulations and other measures that govern a wide range of topics including those related to matters beyond our core products and services For instance new laws regulations policies and international accords relating to ESG matters including sustainability climate change human capital and diversity are being developed and formalized in Europe the US and elsewhere which may entail specific targetdriven frameworks andor disclosure requirements We have implemented robust ESG programs adopted reporting frameworks and principles and announced a number of goals and initiatives The implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments and our goals with all of their contingencies dependencies and in certain cases reliance on thirdparty verification andor performance are complex and ambitious and may change We cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all and projects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate Any failure or perceived failure by us to adhere to our public statements comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results We could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions Our effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including changes in the interpretation of existing laws Further if we are 21 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers employees and partners as the withholding agent we could become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities As a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions such as transferpricing adjustments or permanentestablishment claims Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could harm our financial condition and operating results require adverse changes to our business practices or subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries In addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty Although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made Furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results For example various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenuebased taxes such as digital services taxes and other targeted taxes which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15 O ur effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years as a result of these changes Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance longterm stockholder value and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves We engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares Further our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices increase their volatility reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders ability to influence corporate matters Our Class B stock has 10 votes per share our Class A stock has one vote per share and our Class C stock has no voting rights As of December 31 2023 Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 865 of our outstanding Class B stock which represented approximately 515 of the voting power of our outstanding common stock Through their stock ownership Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future In addition because our Class C stock carries no voting rights except as required by applicable law the issuance of the Class C stock including in future stockbased acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs could continue Larry and Sergeys current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect Larry and Sergeys relative voting power This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable Provisions in Alphabets certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management These provisions include the following Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation death or removal of a director Our stockholders may not act by written consent which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders meeting Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates 22 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirers own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company Our Board of Directors may issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock which makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us As a Delaware corporation we are also subject to certain Delaware antitakeover provisions Under Delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the Board of Directors has approved the transaction Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us The trading price for our Class A stock and nonvoting Class C stock may continue to be volatile The trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile In addition to the factors discussed in this report the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including among others the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world These broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock regardless of our actual operating performance General Risks Our operating results may fluctuate which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations Our operating results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many outside of our control including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events As a result comparing our operating results including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues on a periodtoperiod basis may not be meaningful and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance Consequently our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations Acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures could result in operating difficulties dilution and other consequences that could harm our business financial condition and operating results Acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures Some of the areas where we face risks include diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic arrangements failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis if at all from governmental authorities or conditions placed upon approval that could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations technologies services and personnel including cultural integration and retention of employees and further develop the acquired business or technology implementation of controls or remediation of control deficiencies procedures and policies at the acquired company integration of the acquired companys accounting and other administrative systems and the coordination of product engineering and sales and marketing functions transition of operations users and customers onto our existing platforms in the case of foreign acquisitions the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic currency political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries failure to accomplish commercial strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments joint ventures and other strategic arrangements failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity 23 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition including patent and trademark infringement claims data privacy and security issues violations of laws commercial disputes tax liabilities warranty claims product liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities and litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally Our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairment of goodwill andor purchased longlived assets and restructuring charges any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results Also the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements may not materialize In connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities which could harm our financial condition and operating results We rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel hire qualified personnel or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture we may not be able to grow or operate effectively Our performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as well as members of our senior management team For instance Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction Our ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense and certain of our competitors have directly targeted and may continue to target our employees In addition our compensation arrangements such as our equity award programs may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire mobilize or retain some of our global talent All of our executive officers and key employees are atwill employees and we do not maintain any keyperson life insurance policies In addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork As our organization grows and evolves we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to everchanging circumstances such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture Under our hybrid work models we may experience increased costs andor disruption in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable ITEM 1C CYBERSECURITY We maintain a comprehensive process for identifying assessing

1A Risk Factors and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K The following section generally discusses 2023 results compared to 2022 results Discussion of 2022 results compared to 2021 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10K Understanding Alphabets Financial Results Alphabet is a collection of businesses the largest of which is Google We report Google in two segments Google Services and Google Cloud we also report all nonGoogle businesses collectively as Other Bets For additional information on our segments see Part I Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect The following longterm trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results Users behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves The continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during the COVID19 pandemic In addition we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers which may affect our revenues Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins Our users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities such as smartphones wearables connected TVs and smart home devices and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business We benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels including mobile and newer advertising formats The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search Additionally as the market for a particular device type or modality matures our advertising revenues may be affected For example changing dynamics within the global smartphone market such as increased market saturation in developed countries can affect our mobile advertising revenues We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues TAC rate to be affected by changes in device mix geographic mix partner agreement terms partner mix the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points product mix the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels and revenue share terms We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins As online advertising evolves we continue to expand our product offerings which may affect our monetization As interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves we continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs which may affect our monetization For example revenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads We also expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products such as AI in Search that could affect our monetization trends When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then on monetization As users in developing economies increasingly come online our revenues from international markets continue to increase and may require continued investments In addition movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues 29 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc The shift to online as well as the advent of the multidevice world has brought opportunities outside of the US including in emerging markets such as India We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets This has led to a trend of increased revenues from emerging markets We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets particularly as lowcost mobile devices become more available This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets International revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US dollar While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings The revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins Revenues from cloud consumer subscriptions platforms and devices which may have differing characteristics than our advertising revenues have grown over time and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products and services The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising revenues For example sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures We continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new innovative offerings improve our existing offerings and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our businesses We also expect to increase relative to 2023 our investment in our technical infrastructure including servers network equipment and data centers to support the growth of our business and our longterm initiatives in particular in support of AI products and services In addition acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment and we are subject to claims lawsuits investigations and other forms of potential legal liability which could affect our business practices and financial results Changes in social political economic tax and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters including investigations lawsuits and regulatory actions have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices As these global trends continue our cost of doing business may increase our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited and we may need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the US Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General legislative proposals and pending litigation in the US EU and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various legislative proposals in the US focused on large technology platforms For additional information see Item 1A Risk Factors and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success We expect to

with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools sales of other products and services such as apps and inapp purchases and devices and fees received for consumer subscriptionbased products For additional information on how we recognize revenue see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K In addition to the longterm trends and their financial effect on our business discussed above fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of general factors including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 30 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc changes in pricing such as those resulting from changes in fee structures discounts and customer incentives general economic conditions and various external dynamics including geopolitical events regulations and other measures and their effect on advertiser consumer and enterprise spending new product and service launches and seasonality Additionally fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising Google advertising revenues from other sources Google subscriptions platforms and devices revenues Google Cloud and Other Bets revenues have been and may continue to be affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues as described below Google Services Google Services revenues consist of Google advertising as well as Google subscriptions platforms and devices revenues Google Advertising Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following Google Search other which includes revenues generated on Google search properties including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Googlecom as their default search in browsers toolbars etc and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail Google Maps and Google Play YouTube ads which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties and Google Network which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob AdSense and Google Ad Manager We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues paid clicks and costperclick pertain to traffic on Google Search other properties while impressions and costperimpression pertain to traffic on our Google Network properties Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by endusers on Google search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail Google Maps and Google Play Costperclick is defined as clickdriven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in AdMob AdSense and Google Ad Manager Costperimpression is defined as impressionbased and clickbased revenues divided by our total number of impressions and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users As our business evolves we periodically review refine and update our methodologies for monitoring gathering and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity Fluctuations in our advertising revenues as well as the change in paid clicks and costperclick on Google Search other properties and the change in impressions and costperimpression on Google Network properties and the correlation between these items have been and may continue to be affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above such as advertiser competition for keywords changes in advertising quality formats delivery or policy changes in device mix seasonal fluctuations in internet usage advertising expenditures and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality and traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels 31 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Google

enterprise services Fluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above such as customer usage Other Bets Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcarerelated services and internet services Costs and Expenses Our cost structure has two components cost of revenues and operating expenses Our operating expenses include costs related to RD sales and marketing and general and administrative functions Certain of our costs and expenses including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue Additionally fluctuations in compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount in particular due to annual stockbased compensation SBC awards that generally vest over four years Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues TAC includes amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services Our distribution partners include browser providers mobile carriers original equipment manufacturers and software developers and amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties Other cost of revenues primarily includes compensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and customer and product support content acquisition costs which are

depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure and inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell 32 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search other properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners Operating Expenses Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business

in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding periodtoperiod comparisons We use nonGAAP constant currency revenues constant currency revenues and nonGAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decisionmaking and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements FX Effect as well as hedging activities which are recognized at the consolidated level We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a yearonyear basis Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both

billion and 19 billion respectively The increase in TAC from 2022 to 2023 was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC The TAC rate decreased from 218 to 214 from 2022 to 2023 primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google Search other properties The TAC rate on Google Search other revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from 2022 to 2023 The increase in other cost of revenues from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs largely for YouTube and compensation expenses which included 479 million of charges related to employee severance associated with the reduction in our workforce Additionally other cost of revenues benefited from a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and network equipment The increase in other cost of revenues of 119

see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K In addition we regularly enter into multiyear noncancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes such as renewable energy certificates These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP In doing so we have to make estimates and assumptions Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations Accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors For a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Fair Value Measurements of NonMarketable Equity Securities We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisting primarily of our nonmarketable equity securities These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method the measurement alternative and are measured at cost less impairment subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer These adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities which may require the use of unobservable inputs Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of estimates using the best information available which may include cash flow projections or other available market data Nonmarketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment based on qualitative factors including the companies financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources among others When indicators of impairment exist we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs including discount rates investee revenues and costs and comparable market data of private and public companies among others 43 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc When the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists we write down the investment to its current fair value We also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments ie performance fees We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs Property and Equipment We assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations changes in the planned use and utilization of assets or technological advancements that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the assets Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the US and foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes Recording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations including evaluation of comparable and resolved tax exposures applicability of tax laws and likelihood of settlement We evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically considering changes in facts and circumstances such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties In addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes Loss Contingencies We are regularly subject to claims lawsuits regulatory and government investigations other proceedings and consent orders involving competition intellectual property privacy data security tax and related compliance labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms personal injury consumer protection and other matters Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K We evaluate on a regular basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters Until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material Change in Accounting Estimate In January 2023 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023 For additional information see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K 44 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity investment risks Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies International revenues as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar As discussed below we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar British pound Canadian dollar Euro and Japanese yen For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 could be experienced We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary These forward and option contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OIE which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts If an adverse 10 foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets liabilities and commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date it would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approxima tely 136 million and 503 million as of December 31 2022 and 2023 respectively after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended December 31 2022 and 2023 We use foreign currency forward and option contracts including collars an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options to protect forecasted US dollarequivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates When the US dollar strengthens gains from foreign currency forward and option contacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings When the US dollar weakens losses from foreign currency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings These hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur I f the US dollar weakened by 10 as of December 31 2022 and 2023 the amount recorded in AOCI related to our cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately 13 billion and 15 billion lower as of December 31 2022 and 2023 respectively The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations If the US dollar weakened by 10 the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment CTA within AOCI related to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately 903 million and 946 million lower as of December 31 2022 and 2023 respectively The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries Interest Rate Risk Our Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that w ill allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity We invest primarily in debt securities including government bonds corporate debt securities mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities money market and other funds time deposits and interest rate derivatives By policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OIE We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold less any expected credit losses 45 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc We use valueatrisk VaR analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable debt security portfolio The VaR is the expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates We use a variancecovariance VaR model with 95 confidence interval The estimated oneday loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31 2022 and 2023 are shown below in millions As of December 31 12Month Average As of December 31 2022 2023 2022 2023 Risk category interest rate 256 296 198 271 Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of December 31 2022 and 2023 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation Equity Investment Risk Our marketable and nonmarketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our nonmarketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages We record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility and represent 52 billion and 60 billion of our investments as of December 31 2022 and 2023 respectively A hypothetical adverse price change of 10 on our December 31 2023 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by 597 million From time to time we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities Our nonmarketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment referred to as the measurement alternative The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date These investments especially those that are in the early stages are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a decline in financial condition which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies Valuations of our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses In addition global economic conditions could result in additional volatility The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings acquisitions private sales or other market events Changes in the valuation of nonmarketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities As of December 31 2022 and 2023 the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities which were accounted for under the measurement alternative was 285 billion and 288 billion respectively The carrying values of our equity method investments which totaled approximately 17 billion as of December 31 2022 and 2023 generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes However these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover For additional information about our equity investments see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this

A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate s Ernst Young LLP San Jose California January 30 2024 50 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Alphabet Inc CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS in millions except par value

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Alphabet Inc NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003 In 2015 we implemented a holding company reorganization and as a result Alphabet Inc Alphabet became the successor issuer to Google We generate revenues by delivering relevant costeffective online advertising cloudbased solutions that provide enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools sales of other products and services such as fees received for consumer subscriptionbased products apps and inapp purchases and devices Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated Use of Estimates Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to the allowance for credit losses content licenses contingent liabilities fair values of financial instruments and goodwill income taxes inventory and useful lives of property and equipment among others We base our estimates on assumptions both historical and forward looking that are believed to be reasonable and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities In January 2023 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from five years to six years This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2023 Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31 2022 and those placed in service during the year ended December 31 2023 the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense of 39 billion and an increase in net income of 30 billion or 024 per basic and 024 per diluted share for the year ended December 31 2023 Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues Advertising Revenues We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on Google Search and other properties including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Googlecom as their default search in browsers toolbars etc and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail Google Maps and Google Play YouTube properties and Google Network properties including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob AdSense and Google Ad Manager Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads Google Ad Manager Google Display Video 360 and Google Marketing Platform among others We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement For brand advertising we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed or a user views the ad For ads placed on Google Network properties we evaluate whether we are the principal ie report revenues on a gross basis or agent ie report revenues on a net basis Generally we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis that is the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues 56 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues Where we are the principal we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing Google Subscriptions Platforms and Devices Google subscriptions platforms and devices revenues consist of revenues from consumer subscriptions which primarily include revenues from YouTube services such YouTube TV YouTube Music and Premium and NFL Sunday Ticket as well as Google One platforms which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and inapp purchases devices which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices and other products and services Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription primarily monthly We report revenues from Google Play app sales and inapp purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users for which we earn a service fee Google Cloud Revenues Google Cloud revenues consist of revenues from Google Cloud Platform which generates consumptionbased fees and subscriptions for infrastructure platform and other services These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity databases analytics and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure Vertex AI platform and Duet AI for Google Cloud Google Workspace which includes subscriptions for cloudbased communication and collaboration tools for enterprises such as Calendar Gmail Docs Drive and Meet with integrated features like Duet AI in Google Workspace and other enterprise services Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a year Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services based on the quantity of services consumed Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations For such arrangements we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers Customer Incentives and Credits Certain customers receive cashbased incentives or credits which are accounted for as variable consideration We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration Sales Commissions We expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues TAC includes amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services Our distribution partners include browser providers mobile carriers original equipment manufacturers and software developers and amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties 57 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Other cost of revenues includes compensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and customer and product support content acquisition costs which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure and inventory and other costs related to the devices we sell Software Development Costs We expense software development costs including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold leased or marketed to external users before technological feasibility is reached Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products As a result development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloudbased applications used to deliver our services We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented Stockbased Compensation Stockbased compensation SBC primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units RSUs RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date We recognize RSU expense using the straightline attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur For RSUs shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees As a result fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding and the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paidin capital Additionally SBC includes other stockbased awards such as performance stock units PSUs that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies PSUs and certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet company Advertising and Promotional Expenses We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred For the years ended December 31 2021 2022 and 2023 advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately 79 billion 92 billion and 87 billion respectively Performance Fees Performance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs Performance fees are recorded as a component of OIE Fair Value Measurements Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants As such fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a threetier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 58 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Level 2 Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data Where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates and credit ratings Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents marketable securities derivative financial instruments and certain nonmarketable debt securities Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include nonmarketable equity securities Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed if required We measure certain other instruments including SBC awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis Financial Instruments Our financial instruments include cash cash equivalents marketable and nonmarketable securities derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable Credit Risks We are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents marketable debt securities derivative financial instruments including foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness credit limits and use of collateral management Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend We generally do not require collateral from our customers Cash Equivalents We invest excess cash primarily in government bonds corporate debt securities mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities time deposits and money market funds Marketable Securities We classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as availableforsale After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives as well as our liquidity requirements we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities As we view these securities as available to support current operations we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets We carry these securities at fair value and report the unrealized gains and losses net of taxes as a component of stockholders equity except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses which are recorded in OIE For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OIE We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method and we record such gains and losses as a component of OIE Our investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses including unrealized recognized in OIE We classify our marketable equity securities subject to longterm lockup restrictions beyond 12 months as other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets NonMarketable Securities Nonmarketable securities primarily consist of equity securities We account for nonmarketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method All other nonmarketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative Under the measurement alternative the carrying value is measured at cost less any impairment plus or minus 59 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of OIE Nonmarketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Derivative Financial Instruments See Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments Accounts Receivable Our payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or services offered The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant For certain products or services and customers we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer Additionally accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the customer We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations We also consider customerspecific information current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions Other Our financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into commercial arrangements at or near the same time For these transactions judgment is required in assessing the substance of the arrangements including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP and determining the value of the components of the arrangements including the fair value of the investments Additionally if our investment in such companies becomes impaired any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced Impairment of Investments We periodically review our debt and nonmarketable equity securities for impairment For debt securities in an unrealized loss position we determine whether a credit loss exists The credit loss is estimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OIE not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI If we have an intent to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of OIE For nonmarketable equity securities including equity method investments we consider whether impairment indicators exist by evaluating the companies financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources among other indicators If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired we write down the investment to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OIE We prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach Inventory Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value Cost is computed using the firstin firstout method Variable Interest Entities We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity VIE We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses 60 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc or benefits If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP Periodically we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary Property and Equipment Property and equipment includes the following categories land and buildings information technology assets construction in progress leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures Land and buildings include land offices data centers and related building improvements Information technology assets include servers and network equipment Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation is recorded using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which we regularly evaluate Land is not depreciated We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years We depreciate information technology assets generally over a period of six years for servers and network equipment We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets Depreciation for buildings information technology assets leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our intended use Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination We evaluate our reporting units periodically as well as when changes in our operating segments occur For changes in reporting units we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired Goodwill impairments were no t material for the periods presented Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception Our lease agreements generally contain lease and nonlease components Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed Nonlease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities We combine fixed payments for nonlease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities Certain lease agreements contain variable payments which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index and payments for maintenance and utilities Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in economic environments where the leased asset is located Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option We generally use the base noncancelable lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the longterm portion is included in operating lease liabilities Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment net Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or longterm debt Operating lease expense excluding variable lease costs is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term Impairment of LongLived Assets We review leases property and equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected 61 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc to generate If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that based on technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority In addition we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision Business Combinations We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values except for revenue contracts acquired which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill Acquisitionrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred Foreign Currency We translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to US dollars using monthend exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average rates for the annual period derived from monthend exchange rates for revenues costs and expenses We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders equity We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain loss in OIE Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023 the Financial Standards Accounting Board FASB

attributable to noncontrolling interests was not material for an y period presented and is included within the other component of OIE See Note 7 for further details on OIE Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance Therefore we are not the primary beneficiary and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements We account for these investments primarily as nonmarketable equity securities or equity method investments The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments The maximum exposure and carrying value of these unconsolidated VIEs were 28 billion and 27 billion respectively as of December 31 2022 and 57 billion and 40 billion respectively as of December 31 2023 The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying value relates primarily to future funding commitments

agreements with future fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments of 106 billion as of December 31 2023 of which the majority is paid over seven years ending in the first quarter of 2030 Indemnifications In the normal course of business including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate activities we indemnify certain parties including advertisers Google Network partners distribution partners customers of Google Cloud offerings lessors and service providers with respect to certain matters We have agreed to defend andor hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim In addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement Additionally the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position However to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period As of December 31 2023 we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible Legal Matters We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the reasonably possible loss We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments as appropriate Certain outstanding matters seek speculative substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts substantial changes to our business practices and products or structural remedies Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties and could either individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred 77 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Antitrust Investigations On November 30 2010 the ECs Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrustrelated complaints against us On June 27 2017 the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law The EC decision imposed a 24 billion 27 billion as of June 27 2017 fine On September 11 2017 we appealed the EC decision to the General Court and on September 27 2017 we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the ECs decision We recognized a charge of 27 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017 On November 10 2021 the General Court rejected our appeal and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January 20 2022 On July 18 2018 the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Googles Androidrelated distribution agreements infringed European competition law The EC decision imposed a 43 billion 51 billion as of June 30 2018 fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue On October 9 2018 we appealed the EC decision and on October 29 2018 we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices On September 14 2022 the General Court reduced the fine from 43 billion to 41 billion We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice In 2018 we recognized a charge of 51 billion for the fine which we reduced by 217 million in 2022 On March 20 2019 the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law The EC decision imposed a fine of 15 billion 17 billion as of March 20 2019 and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners agreements which we implemented prior to the decision On June 4 2019 we appealed the EC decision We recognized a charge of 17 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019 From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by regulatory authorities in the US Europe and other jurisdictions globally Examples for which given their nature we cannot estimate a possible loss include In August 2019 we began receiving civil investigative demands from the US Department of Justice DOJ requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on October 20 2020 alleging that Google violated US antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising The trial ended on November 16 2023 and we expect a decision in 2024 Further in June 2022 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ACCC and the United Kingdoms Competition and Markets Authority CMA each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices On December 16 2020 a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated US antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology and a trial is scheduled for March 2025 Additionally on January 24 2023 the DOJ along with a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Googles digital advertising technology products violate US antitrust laws and on April 17 2023 a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint The EC the CMA and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Googles advertising technology business practices on June 22 2021 May 25 2022 and June 29 2022 respectively On June 14 2023 the EC issued a Statement of Objections SO informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology We responded to the SO on December 1 2023 On July 7 2021 a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Googles operation of Android and Google Play violated US antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws In September 2023 we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories The US District Court subsequently vacated the trial date with the states and any final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024 In May 2022 the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Plays business practices Korean regulators are investigating Google Plays billing practices including a formal review in May 2022 of Googles compliance with the new app store billing regulations We believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the US the EC and other regulators around the world 78 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Privacy Matters We are subject to a number of privacyrelated laws and regulations and we currently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions For example there are ongoing investigations and litigation in the US and the EU including those relating to our collection and use of location information and advertising practices which could result in significant fines judgments and product changes Patent and Intellectual Property Claims We have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe others intellectual property rights Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services As a result we may have to change our business practices and develop noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business In addition the US International Trade Commission ITC has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the US Because the US is an important market a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important products into the US or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products Furthermore many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property infringement claims which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims In addition our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business Other We are subject to claims lawsuits regulatory and government investigations other proceedings and consent orders involving competition intellectual property data security tax and related compliance labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms personal injury consumer protection and other matters For example in December 2023 a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v Google finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Plays business The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024 and the range of potential remedies vary widely We plan to appeal We also periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law These claims consent orders lawsuits regulatory and government investigations and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties injunctive relief ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations changes to our products and services alterations to our business models and operations and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences all of which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia For example civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts including those of sanctioned parties We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect NonIncome Taxes We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to nonincome tax matters The subject matter of nonincome tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits We accrue nonincome taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the reasonably possible loss Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations See Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies 79 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Note 11 Stockholders Equity Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock Our Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical except with respect to voting Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share Class C capital stock has no voting rights except as required by applicable law Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock Share Repurchases In the years ended December 31 2021 2022 and 2023 we repurchased 503 billion 593 billion and 622 billion respectively of Alphabets Class A and Class C shares In April 2023 the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional 700 billion of its Class A and Class C shares As of December 31 2023 363 billion remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases The following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired in millions Year Ended December 31 2022 Year Ended December 31 2023 Shares Amount Shares Amount Class A share repurchases 61 6719 78 9316 Class

in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares Repurchases are executed from time to time subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions including through Rule 10b51 plans The repurchase program does not have an expiration date Note 12 Net Income Per Share We compute net income per share of Class A Class B and Class C stock using the twoclass method Basic net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of shares outstanding during the period Diluted net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable shares The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares The rights including the liquidation and dividend rights of the holders of our Class A Class B and Class C stock are identical except with respect to voting Furthermore there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation as well as Delaware law which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A Class B and Class C stock Specifically Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights powers or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment In addition our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors As a result the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A Class B and Class C stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis In the years ended December 31 2021 2022 and 2023 the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A Class B and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc 80 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc The following

of capitalization and amortization of RD expenses starting in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act In 2023 the IRS issued a rule change allowing taxpayers to temporarily apply the regulations in effect prior to 2022 related to US federal foreign tax credits as well as a separate rule change with interim guidance on the capitalization and amortization of RD expenses A cumulative onetime adjustment applicable to the prior period for these tax rule changes was recorded in 2023 Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between

carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately 71 billion 186 billion and 18 billion respectively If not utilized the federal net 84 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024 foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029 It is more likely than not that the majority of the net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance against them The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions As of December 31 2023 our Federal and California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately 600 million and 63 billion respectively If not utilized the Federal RD credit will begin to expire in 2037 and the California RD credit can be carried over indefinitely We believe the majority of the federal tax credit and state tax credit is not likely to be realized As of December 31 2023 our investment tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes were approximately 10 billion and will begin to expire in 2029 We use the flowthrough method of accounting for investment tax credits We believe this tax credit is not likely to be realized As of December 31 2023 we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets certain federal net operating losses certain state net operating losses and tax credits net deferred tax assets relating to Other Bet companies and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized We continue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly Uncertain Tax Positions The following table summarizes the activity related

gross unrecognized tax benefits 5158 7055 9438 We are subject to income taxes in the US and foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was 52 billion 71 billion and 94 billion as of December 31 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively of which 37 billion 53 billion and 74 billion if recognized would affect our effective tax rate respectively As of December 31 2022 and 2023 we accrued 346 million and 622 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes respectively We file income tax returns in the US federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions Our two major tax jurisdictions are the US federal and Ireland We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment We continue to defend such claims as presented The tax years 2016 through 2022 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations However the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolutions occur Although the timing of resolution settlement and closure of audits is not certain it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain US federal state and non US tax positions could decrease by approximately 700 million in the next 12 months Positions that may be resolved include various US and nonUS matters 85 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Note 15 Information about Segments and Geographic Areas We report our segment results as
