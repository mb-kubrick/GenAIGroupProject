PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS Overview As our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders letter Google is not a conventional company We do not intend to become one That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots like artificial intelligence AI research and quantum computing We continue this work under the leadership of Sundar Pichai who has served as CEO of Google since 2015 and as CEO of Alphabet since 2019 Alphabet is a collection of businesses the largest of which is Google which we report as two segments Google Services and Google Cloud We report all nonGoogle businesses collectively as Other Bets Our Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business We take a long term view and manage the portfolio of Other Bets with the discipline and rigor needed to deliver longterm returns Our Alphabet structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence Access and technology for everyone The Internet is one of the worlds most powerful equalizers capable of propelling new ideas and people forward Our mission to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998 Since then weve evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done Were focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge health happiness and success Across Alphabet were focused on continually innovating in areas where technology can have an impact on peoples lives Every year there are trillions of searches on Google and we continue to invest deeply in AI and other technologies to ensure the most helpful Search experience possible People come to YouTube for entertainment information and opportunities to learn something new And Google Assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices providing intelligent help throughout your day no matter where you are Since the pandemic began our teams have built new features to help users go about their daily lives and to support businesses working to serve their customers during an uncertain time In conjunction with Apple we launched Exposure Notification apps that are being used by local governments globally Our COVID19 Community Mobility Reports are used by public health agencies and researchers around the globe and weve committed hundreds of millions of dollars to help small businesses through a combination of small business loans grants and ad credits Importantly weve made authoritative content a key focus area across both Google Search and YouTube to help users search for trusted public health information Our Other Bets are also pursuing initiatives with similar goals For instance as a part of our efforts in the Metro Phoenix area Waymo is working toward our goal of making transportation safer and easier for everyone while Verily is developing tools and platforms to improve health outcomes Moonshots Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done making only incremental changes This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time especially in technology where change tends to be revolutionary not evolutionary People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser We continue to look toward the future and continue to invest for the longterm As we said in the original founders letter we will not shy away from highrisk highreward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our longterm success The power of machine learning Across the company machine learning and AI are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations Our investments in machine learning over the past decade have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more helpful For example a huge breakthrough in natural language understanding called BERT now improves results for almost every English language search query DeepMind made a significant AIpowered breakthrough solving a 50yearold protein folding challenge which will help us better understand one of lifes fundamental building blocks and will enable researchers to tackle new and difficult problems from fighting diseases to environmental sustainability 5 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Google For reporting purposes Google comprises two segments Google Services and Google Cloud Google Services Serving our users We have always been a company committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people Our product innovations have made our services widely used and our brand one of the most recognized in the world Google Services core products and platforms include Android Chrome Gmail Google Drive Google Maps Google Photos Google Play Search and YouTube each with broad and growing adoption by users around the world Our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago Rather than the ten blue links in our early search results users can now get direct answers to their questions using their computer mobile device or their own voice making it quicker easier and more natural to find what youre looking for This drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube With the migration to mobile people are consuming more digital content by watching more videos playing more games listening to more music reading more books and using more apps than ever before Working with content creators and partners we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find great digital content Fueling all of these great digital experiences are powerful platforms and hardware Thats why we continue to invest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system Chrome browser Chrome operating system as well as growing our family of great hardware devices We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful make your life easier and get better over time by combining the best of our AI software and hardware This is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products like Pixel 4a Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 phones Chromecast with Google TV and the Google Nest Hub smart display Creating beautiful products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run Key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy security and user choice As the Internet evolves we continue to invest in keeping data safe

advertising practices and protecting users on the web We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways ranging 6 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc from filtering out invalid traffic removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year to closely monitoring the sites apps and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content We continue to look to the future and are making longterm investments that will grow revenues beyond advertising including Google Play hardware and YouTube We are also investing in research efforts in AI and quantum computing to foster innovation across our businesses and create new opportunities Google Cloud Google was a company built in the cloud We continue to invest in infrastructure security data management analytics and AI We see significant opportunity in helping businesses utilize these strengths with features like data migration modern development environments and machine learning tools to provide enterpriseready cloud services including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace formerly known as G Suite Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build test and deploy applications on its highly scalable and reliable infrastructure Our Google Workspace collaboration tools which include apps like Gmail Docs Drive Calendar Meet and more are designed with realtime collaboration and machine intelligence to help people work smarter Because more and more of todays great digital experiences are being built in the cloud our Google Cloud products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services and Google Workspace collaboration tools Other Bets Throughout Alphabet we are also using technology to try and solve big problems across many industries Alphabets investment in our portfolio of Other Bets include emerging businesses at various stages of development ranging from those in the research and development phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization and our goal is for them to become thriving successful businesses in the medium to long term While these earlystage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries Revenues are primarily generated from internet and TV services as well as licensing and RD services Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors We are investing in our portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus scale and pace of investments Competition Our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business particularly from companies that seek to connect people with online information and provide them with relevant advertising We face competition from General purpose search engines and information services such as Baidu Microsofts Bing Naver Seznam Verizons Yahoo and Yandex Vertical search engines and ecommerce websites such as Amazon and eBay ecommerce Bookings Kayak travel queries Microsofts LinkedIn job queries and WebMD health queries Some users will navigate directly to such content websites and apps rather than go through Google Social networks such as Facebook Snapchat and Twitter Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals rather than seeking information through traditional search engines Other forms of advertising such as billboards magazines newspapers radio and television Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media both online and offline Other online advertising platforms and networks including Amazon AppNexus Criteo and Facebook that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads our primary auctionbased advertising platform Providers of digital video services such as Amazon Apple ATT Disney Facebook Hulu Netflix and TikTok In businesses that are further afield from our advertising business we compete with companies that have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users We face competition from Other digital content and application platform providers such as Amazon and Apple 7 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Companies that design manufacture and market consumer hardware products including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms Providers of enterprise cloud services including Alibaba Amazon and Microsoft Digital assistant providers such as Amazon and Apple Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to deliver and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses Specifically for advertising competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining Users for whom other products and services are literally one click away largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising as well as the general usefulness security and availability of our products and services Advertisers primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads and ultimately customers and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels Content providers primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising and the terms of our agreements with them Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability At Google we build technology that helps people do more for the planet We strive to build sustainability into everything we do including designing and operating efficient data centers advancing carbonfree energy creating sustainable workplaces building better devices and services empowering users with technology and enabling a responsible supply chain Google has been carbon neutral since 2007 and in 2019 for the third consecutive year we matched 100 of our electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases We are the largest annual corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world based on renewable electricity purchased in megawatthour MWh In 2020 we neutralized our entire legacy carbon footprint since our founding covering all our operational emissions before we became carbon neutral in 2007 making Google the first major company to achieve carbon neutrality for its entire operating history In our third decade of climate action weve set our most ambitious goal yet to run our business on carbonfree energy everywhere at all times by 2030 Were also investing in technologies to help our partners and people all over the world make sustainable choices For example we intend to enable 5 GW of new carbonfree energy across our key manufacturing regions by 2030 through investment We anticipate this will spur more than 5 billion in clean energy investments avoid the amount of emissions equal to taking more than 1 million cars off the road each year and create more than 8000 clean energy jobs With the Environmental Insights Explorer were also working to help more than 500 cities and local governments globally reduce a total of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually by 2030 thats the equivalent of the annual carbon emissions of a country the size of Japan Googles products are already helping people make more sustainable choices in their daily lives whether its using Google Maps to find bikeshares and electric vehicle charging stations or in many European countries using Google Flights to sort the least carbonintensive option flights There are more tools and information we can provide and our goal is to find new ways that our products can help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by 2022 Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time In 2017 we developed a climate resilience strategy which included conducting a climate scenario analysis Weve earned a spot on the CDP formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project Climate Change A List for seven consecutive years We believe our CDP climate change response reflects the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures TCFD In 2020 we issued 575 billion in sustainability bonds the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in history The net proceeds from the issuance are used to fund environmentally and socially responsible projects in the following eight areas energy efficiency clean energy green buildings clean transportation circular economy and design affordable housing commitment to racial equity and support for small businesses and COVID19 crisis response More information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability

including but not limited to those described below which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results Risks Specific to our Company We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising and reduced spending by advertisers a loss of partners or new and existing technologies that block ads online andor affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business We generate d over 80 o f total revenues from the display of ads online in 2020 Many of our advertisers companies that distribute our products and services digital publishers and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value such as increased numbers of users or customers new sales leads increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternatives Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices as well as changes to other companies advertising andor data privacy practices may affect the advertising that we are able to provide which could harm our business In addition technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of thirdparty digital advertising Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results In addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns Adverse macroeconomic conditions including COVID19 and its effects on the global economy as discussed in greater detail in our COVID19 risk factor under General Risks below have impacted the demand for advertising and resulted in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising and could have an adverse impact on such demand and spend which could harm our financial condition and operating results We face intense competition If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users we may not remain competitive which could harm our business and operating results Our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive Our businesses face changing technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of rival products and services To compete successfully we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative relevant and useful products services and technologies in a timely manner As our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development including through acquisitions in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services We have many competitors in different industries Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging startups Some competitors have longer operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions continuing to invest heavily in research and development and in talent aggressively initiating intellectual property claims whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete aggressively for users advertisers customers and content providers Further discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny thereby affording them competitive advantages Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us Our operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of our users advertisers publishers customers and content providers As technologies continue to develop our competitors may be able to offer experiences that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours This 10 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users advertisers publishers customers and content providers our operating results could be harmed Our ongoing investment in new businesses products services and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our current operations and harm our financial condition and operating results We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies The investments that we are making across Google Services Google Cloud and Other Bets reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users advertisers publishers customers and content providers Our investments in Google Services Google Cloud and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and in pursuing new strategies we may incur unanticipated liabilities These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including diversion of management resources and with respect to Other Bets the use of alternative investment governance or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives Within Google Services we continue to invest heavily in hardware including our smartphones and home devices which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively Within Google Cloud we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterpriseready cloud services including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent particularly to support and scale our salesforce At the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives Within Other Bets we are investing significantly in the areas of health life sciences and transportation among others These investment areas face intense competition from large experienced and wellfunded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability In addition new and evolving products and services including those that use artificial intelligence and machine learning raise ethical technological legal regulatory and other challenges which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation financial condition and operating results Our revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition and the continued expansion of our business into a variety of new fields Changes in device mix geographic mix ongoing product and policy changes product mix and property mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate We may also experience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products services and technologies or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services among other factors In addition COVID19 and its effects on the global economy has impacted and may continue to adversely impact our revenue growth rate as discussed in greater detail in our COVID19 risk factor under General Risks below In addition to a decline in our revenue growth rate we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields including products and services such as hardware Google Cloud and subscription products as well as significant investments in Other Bets all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business including within advertising where changes such as device mix property mix and partner agreements can affect margin The margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could also decrease in the future if we pay a larger percentage of advertising fees to them We may also pay increased TAC to our distribution partners as well as increased content acquisition 11 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc costs to content providers We may also face an increase in infrastructure costs supporting businesses such as Search Google Cloud and YouTube Many of our expenses are less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenues Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance Our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands as well as affect our ability to compete Our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products services and technologies For example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet Also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations Moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important Furthermore there is always the possibility despite our efforts that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets We also face risks associated with our trademarks For example there is a risk that the word Google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search Some courts have ruled that Google is a protectable trademark but it is possible that other courts particularly those outside of the United States may reach a different determination If this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word Google to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brand Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete Also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results Our business depends on strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users advertisers customers content providers and other partners Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google Services Google Cloud and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users advertisers customers content providers and other partners Our brands may be negatively affected by a number of factors including among others reputational issues thirdparty content shared on our platforms data privacy and security issues and developments and product or technical performance failures For example if we fail to appropriately respond to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services andor products or objectionable practices by advertisers or to otherwise adequately address user concerns our users may lose confidence in our brands Furthermore failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business financial condition and operating results Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could harm our financial condition operating results and prospects We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our internetbased services We rely on other companies to manufacture many of our finished products to design certain of our components and parts and to participate in the distribution of our products and services Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them We have experienced andor may experience supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material component or part availability manufacturing capacity labor shortages industry allocations tariffs trade disputes 12 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc and barriers natural disasters or pandemics including COVID19 the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding wildfires and increased storm severity and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers We have experienced andor may in the future experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions that could negatively affect our operations In addition some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and products are available from only one or limited sources and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption In addition a significant supply interruption could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay product availability We may enter into long term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions We may be liable for materials and products that are not consumed due to market acceptance technological change obsolescences quality product recalls and warranty issues For instance because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volumebased pricing or minimum purchase requirements if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and negatively affect our financial results Furthermore certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply Our products and services may have quality issues resulting from design manufacturing or operations Sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective it could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and where applicable our company policies such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct regarding workplace and employment practices data security environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions canceled orders harm to key relationships and damage to our reputation Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims Interruption interference with or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services which could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results In addition complications with the design or implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system could harm our business and operations The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems Our systems are vulnerable to damage interference or interruption from modifications or upgrades terrorist attacks natural disasters or pandemics including COVID19 the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding wildfires and increased storm severity power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses ransomware attacks computer denial of service attacks phishing schemes or other attempts to harm or access our systems Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters Our data centers are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism and in some cases to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators Some of our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic including COVID19 closure of a facility or other unanticipated problems at or impacting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service In addition our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems In addition we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results We are in the process of a multiyear implementation of a new ERP system which will replace much of our existing core financial systems The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records enhance the flow of financial information improve data management and provide timely information to our management team We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing delays increased costs and other difficulties Failure to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned could harm our business financial condition and operating results Additionally if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected 13 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business our financial condition and operating results Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income and we plan to continue to grow internationally International revenues accounted for approximately 53 of our consolidated revenues in 2020 In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the following Restrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the US Import and export requirements tariffs and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from offering products or providing services to a particular market or that could limit our ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular market and may increase our operating costs Longer payment cycles in some countries increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud Evolving foreign events including the effect of the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges including the transfer of personal data between the EU and the United Kingdom and new customer requirements in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate Anticorruption laws such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent Different employeeemployer relationships existence of works councils and labor unions and other challenges caused by distance language and cultural differences making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions Because we conduct business in currencies other than US dollars but report our financial results in US dollars we face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings particularly in light of market volatilities due to COVID19 Hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results Risks Related to our Industry People access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces our business could be harmed People access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers mobile

incident response capabilities including dedicated worldwide incident response teams our response process particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic including COVID19 may not be adequate may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident may not respond quickly enough or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident As a result we may suffer significant legal reputational or financial exposure which could harm our business financial condition and operating results Our ongoing investments in safety security and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data In addition to our efforts to mitigate cyber attacks we are making significant investments in safety security and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties including investigations and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services As a result of these efforts we could discover incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties We may not discover all such incidents or activity whether as a result of our data limitations including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services the scale of activity on our platform or other factors including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic including COVID19 and we may be notified of such incidents or activity via third parties Such incidents and activities may include the use of user

and damages divert managements time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight Problematic content on our platforms including lowquality usergenerated content web spam content farms and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services We like others in the industry face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent While we invest significantly in efforts to promote highquality and relevant results and to detect and prevent lowquality content and invalid traffic we may be unable to adequately detect and prevent such abuses or promote highquality content particularly during times of a natural disaster

their relevance and utility would rank them Such efforts 15 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc known as web spam may affect the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false misleading or undesirable content Although Englishlanguage web spam in our search results has been reduced and web spam in most other languages is limited we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings We continuously combat web spam in our search results including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spamlike less useful web content to rank highly We also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam from abusing our platforms We also face other challenges from lowquality and irrelevant content websites including content farms which are websites that generate large quantities of lowquality content to help them improve their search rankings We are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on detecting and preventing abuse from lowquality websites We also face other challenges on our platforms including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference activities that threaten the safety andor wellbeing of our users on or offline and the spreading of disinformation among other challenges If we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote highquality content it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms harming our financial condition or operating results It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in monetary penalties and damages divert managements time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users Internet access providers may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively Currently this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace including incumbent telephone companies cable companies mobile communications companies and governmentowned service providers Some of these providers have taken or have stated that they may take measures that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings or by providing our competitors preferential access Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers however substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such protections For example in 2018 the United States Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules which could permit internet access providers to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services In addition in some jurisdictions our products and services have been subject to governmentinitiated restrictions or blockages COVID19 has also resulted in quarantines shelter in place orders and work from home directives all of which have increased demands for internet access and may create access challenges These could result in a loss of existing users customers and advertisers goodwill and increased costs and could impair our ability to attract new users customers and advertisers thereby harming our business Risks Related to Laws and Regulations We face increased regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in regulatory conditions laws and policies governing a wide range of topics that may negatively affect our business We and other companies in the technology industry face increased regulatory scrutiny enforcement action and other proceedings For instance the US Department of Justice joined by a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google on October 20 2020 alleging that Google violated US antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising Separately on December 16 2020 a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated US antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology Various other regulatory agencies in the United States and around the world including competition enforcers consumer protection agencies data protection authorities grand juries interagency consultative groups and a range of other governmental bodies have and continue to review our products and services and their compliance with laws and regulations around the world We continue to cooperate with these investigations Various laws regulations investigations enforcement lawsuits and regulatory actions have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties injunctive relief ongoing auditing and monitoring 16 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc obligations changes to our products and services alterations to our business models and operations and collateral litigation all of which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results Changes in international and local social political economic tax and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics may increase our cost of doing business limit our ability to pursue certain business models offer products or services in certain jurisdictions or cause us to change our business practices We have in the past had to alter or withdraw certain products and services as a result of laws or regulations that made them unfeasible and new laws or regulations such as the News Media Bargaining Code drafted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission currently tabled in parliament could result in our having to alter or withdraw products and services in the future These additional costs of doing business new limitations or changes to our business model or practices could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results A variety of new and existing laws andor interpretations could harm our business We are subject to numerous US and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters New laws and regulations or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices may make our products and services less useful limit our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services require us to incur substantial costs expose us to civil or criminal liability or cause us to change our business practices These laws and regulations are evolving and involve matters central to our business including among others New competition laws and related regulations around the world that can limit certain business practices and in some cases create the risk of significant penalties Privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 that came into effect in January of 2020 and the California Privacy Rights Act which will go into effect in 2023 both of which give new data privacy rights to California residents and SB327 in California which regulates the security of data in connection with internet connected devices Data protection laws passed by many states within the US and by certain countries regarding notification to data subjects andor regulators when there is a security breach of personal data New laws further restricting the collection processing andor sharing of advertisingrelated data Copyright or similar laws around the world including the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market EUCD of April 17 2019 which EU Member States must implement by June 7 2021 and the News Media Bargaining Code drafted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission These and similar laws that have been adopted or proposed introduce new constraining licensing regimes that could affect our ability to operate The EUCD and similar laws could increase the liability of some contentsharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users Some of these laws as well as followon administrative or judicial actions have also created or may create a new property right in news publications that limits the ability of some online services to interact with or present such content They may also impose compensation negotiations with news agencies and publishers for the use of such content which may result in payment obligations that significantly exceed the value that such content provides to Google and its users Data localization laws which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored andor processed within that country Various US and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate the ability of online services to collect information from minors Various laws with regard to content removal and disclosure obligations such as the Network Enforcement Act in Germany which may affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant fines if such laws are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices or when we may not proactively discover such content due to the scale of thirdparty content and the limitations of existing technologies Other countries including Singapore Australia and the United Kingdom have implemented or are considering similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content Various legislative litigation and regulatory activity regarding our Google Play billing policies and business model which could result in monetary penalties damages andor prohibition In addition the applicability and scope of these laws as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain and could harm our business For example 17 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc We rely on statutory safe harbors as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the United States and the ECommerce Directive in Europe against liability for various linking caching and hosting activities Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us There are legislative proposals in both the US and EU that could reduce our safe harbor protection Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU on May 13 2014 on the right to be forgotten which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens The introduction of new businesses products services and technologies our activities in certain jurisdictions or other actions we take may subject us to additional laws and regulations Our investment in a variety of new fields such as healthcare and payment services may expand the scope of regulations that apply to our business The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future Any failure on our part to comply with laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties We are subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings that may harm our business financial condition and operating results We are subject to claims suits and government investigations involving competition intellectual property data privacy and security consumer protection tax labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products including hardware as well as Google Cloud offerings we also are subject to a variety of claims including product warranty product liability and consumer protection claims related to product defects among other litigation We may also be subject to claims involving health and safety hazardous materials usage other environmental impacts or service disruptions or failures Any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources negative publicity and other factors Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant judgment The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in and may in the future result in additional substantial fines penalties injunctions and other sanctions that could harm our business financial condition and operating results We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content Our products and services let users exchange information advertise products and services conduct business and engage in various online activities We also place advertisements displayed on other companies websites and we offer thirdparty products services andor content The law relating to the liability of online service providers for others activities on their services is still somewhat unsettled around the world Claims have been brought against us for defamation negligence breaches of contract copyright and trademark infringement unfair competition unlawful activity torts fraud or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services We may be subject to claims by virtue of our involvement in hosting transmitting marketing branding or providing access to content created by third parties Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources may result in monetary liabilities or penalties and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner Privacy and data protection regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas Adverse interpretations of these laws could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results Authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and limits on encryption of user data Adverse legal rulings legislation or regulation could result in fines and orders requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide services harming our business operations Complying with these evolving laws could result in substantial costs and harm the quality of our products and services negatively affecting our business and may be particularly challenging during certain times such as a natural disaster or pandemic including COVID19 Recent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States For example the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU 18 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc users or customers or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU The GDPR creates a range of new compliance obligations Ensuring compliance with the GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs and despite our efforts governmental authorities or others have asserted and may continue to assert that our business practices fail to comply with its requirements If our operations are found to violate GDPR requirements we may incur substantial fines have to change our business practices and face reputational harm any of which could have an adverse effect on our business In particular serious breaches of the GDPR can result in administrative fines of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenues Fines of up to 2 of annual worldwide revenues can be levied for other specified violations The EUUS and the SwissUS Privacy Shield frameworks allow US companies that selfcertify to the US Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from the EU and Switzerland Recently the CJEU ruled that the EUUS Privacy Shield is an invalid transfer mechanism but upheld Standard Contractual Clauses as a valid transfer mechanism provided they meet certain requirements The validity of data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal regulatory and political developments in both Europe and the US such as recent recommendations from the European Data Protection Board the invalidation of the EUUS Privacy Shield and potential invalidation of other data transfer mechanisms which could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the EEA These developments create some uncertainty and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or harm the operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business We face and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend result in significant damage awards or other costs including indemnification awards and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future We like other internet technology and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights In addition patentholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us As we have grown the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products services and technologies We have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others Other parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in US and international courts and the US International Trade Commission ITC for exclusion and ceaseanddesist orders which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the US or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements if licenses are available at all or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services They may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products services or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business Many of our agreements with our customers and partners including certain suppliers require us to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business Moreover intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers when obtainable may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims Furthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities including those associated with intellectual property claims Regardless of their merits intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle To the extent such claims are successful they may harm our business including our product and service offerings financial condition or operating results Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance longterm stockholder value and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves 19 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc We engage in share repurchases of our Class C capital stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares Further our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices increase their volatility reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders ability to influence corporate matters Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share our Class A common stock has one vote per share and our Class C capital stock has no voting rights As of December 31 2020 Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximate ly 853 of our outstanding Class B common stock which represented approximate ly 515 o f the voting power of our outstanding common stock Through their stock ownership Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future In addition because our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights except as required by applicable law the issuance of the Class C capital stock including in future stockbased acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs could continue Larry and Sergeys current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial which could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable Provisions in Alphabets certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management These provisions include the following Our certificate of incorporation provides for a triclass capital stock structure As a result of this structure Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial As noted above the issuance of the Class C capital stock could have the effect of continuing the influence of Larry and Sergey Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation death or removal of a director which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors Our stockholders may not act by written consent As a result a holder or holders controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders meeting Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirers own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company Our Board of Directors may issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us As a Delaware corporation we are also subject to certain Delaware antitakeover provisions Under Delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the Board of Directors has approved the transaction Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 20 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc General Risks The continuing impacts of COVID19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant and may have an adverse effect on our business operations and our future financial performance Since COVID19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization governments and municipalities around the world have instituted measures in an effort to control the spread of COVID19 including quarantines shelterinplace orders school closings travel restrictions and closure of nonessential businesses The macroeconomic impacts on our business continue to evolve and be unpredictable and may continue to adversely affect our business operations and financial performance As a result of the scale of the ongoing pandemic and the speed at which the global community has been impacted our revenue growth rate and expense as a percentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rate and our future operating results may fall below expectations The future impacts of the ongoing pandemic on our business operations and future financial performance could include but are not limited to Significant decline in advertising revenues as advertiser spending slows due to an economic downturn This decline in advertising revenues could persist through and beyond a recessionary period In addition we may experience a significant and prolonged shift in user behavior such as a shift in interests to less commercial topics Significant decline in other revenues due to a decline or shifts in customer demand For example if consumer demand for electronics significantly declines our hardware revenues could be significantly impacted Adverse impacts to our operating income operating margin net income EPS and respective growth rates particularly if expenses do not decrease across Alphabet at the same pace as revenue declines Many of our expenses are less variable in nature andor may not correlate to changes in revenues including costs associated with our data centers and facilities as well as employee compensation As such we may not be able to decrease them significantly in the shortterm or we may choose not to significantly reduce them in an effort to remain focused on longterm outlook and investment opportunities Significant decline in our operating cash flows as a result of decreased advertiser spending and deterioration in the credit quality and liquidity of our customers which could adversely affect our accounts receivable Investing cash flows could decrease due to slowing spend on data center and facilities construction projects due to a slowing or stopping of construction or significant restrictions placed on construction The prolonged and broadbased shift to a remote working environment continues to create inherent productivity connectivity and oversight challenges and could affect our ability to enhance develop and support existing products and services detect and prevent spam and problematic content hold product sales and marketing events and generate new sales leads among others In addition the changed environment under which we are operating could have an effect on our internal controls over financial reporting as well as our ability to meet a number of our compliance requirements in a timely or quality manner Additional andor extended governmental lockdowns restrictions or new regulations could significantly impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work productively Governmental restrictions have been globally inconsistent and it remains unclear when a return to worksite locations or travel will be permitted or what restrictions will be in place in those environments As we prepare to return our workforce in more locations back to the office in 2021 we may experience increased costs as we prepare our facilities for a safe return to work environment and experiment with hybrid work models in addition to potential effects on our ability to compete effectively and maintain our corporate culture Our operating results may fluctuate which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many outside of our control As a result comparing our operating results including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues on a periodtoperiod basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall Each of the risk factors listed under this Item 1A in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results Our ability to attract user andor customer adoption of and generate significant revenues from new products services and technologies in which we have invested considerable time and resources 21 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Our ability to monetize traffic on Google Search other properties YouTube and our Google Network Members properties across various devices The amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses operations and infrastructure Our focus on longterm goals over shortterm results The results of our acquisitions divestitures and our investments in risky projects including new businesses products services and technologies Our ability to keep our products and services operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions The seasonal fluctuations in internet usage advertising spending and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business As our growth rate has slowed the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate Geopolitical events including trade disputes Changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions Acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures could result in operating difficulties dilution and other consequences that may harm our business financial condition and operating results Acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures Some of the areas where we face risks include Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions Failure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology Implementation or remediation of controls procedures and policies at the acquired company Integration of the acquired companys accounting human resource and other administrative systems and coordination of product engineering and sales and marketing functions Transition of operations users and customers onto our existing platforms Failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis if at all from governmental authorities or conditions placed upon approval that could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction In the case of foreign acquisitions the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic currency political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition including patent and trademark infringement claims data privacy and security issues violations of laws commercial disputes tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairment of goodwill andor purchased longlived assets and restructuring charges any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results 22 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Also the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize In connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities which may harm our financial condition or operating results If we were to lose the services of key personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy Our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team For instance Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction All of our executive officers and key employees are atwill employees and we do not maintain any keyperson life insurance policies The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business We rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture we may not be able to grow effectively Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals Our ability to compete effectively and our future success depends on our continuing to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees In addition our compensation arrangements such as our equity award programs may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees Restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also impact our ability to hire mobilize or retain some of our global talent In addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork As our organization grows and evolves we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our corporate culture and work environments to everchanging circumstances such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic including COVID19 and these changes could impact our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse impact on our corporate culture We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments and in some instances our financial statements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over time The market value of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration or losses performance and financial results of the underlying entities foreign exchange rates changes in interest rates including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates the effect of new or changing regulations the stock market in general or other factors The effect of COVID19 on our impairment assessment for nonmarketable investments requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the impact We measure certain of our nonmarketable equity and debt investments certain other instruments including stockbased compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination at fair value on a nonrecurring basis The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs require management judgment and estimation and may change over time We adjust the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investments to fair value for observable transactions of identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments All gains and losses on nonmarketable equity securities realized and unrealized are recognized in other income expense which increases the volatility of our other income expense The unrealized gains and losses we record on our nonmarketable equity securities in any particular period may differ significantly from the realized gains or losses we ultimately experience on such investments As a result of these factors the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents as well as our marketable and nonmarketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results We could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities Our future income taxes could be negatively affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program changes in the valuation of our deferred tax 23 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc assets or liabilities the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including changes in the interpretation of existing laws as well as certain discrete items In addition we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities As a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions including in Europe on various taxrelated assertions such as transferpricing adjustments or permanentestablishment claims Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and could require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business It may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries resulting in the diversion of managements time and attention In addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made Furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that impair our financial results Various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering digital services taxes which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapp ing international tax regimes The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD recently released proposals relating to its initiative for modernizing international tax rules with the goal of having different countries implement a modernized and aligned international tax framework but there can be no guarantee that this will occur In addition in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the global spread of COVID19 legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may propose changes to their tax rules These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes The impact of these potential new rules on us our longterm tax planning and our effective tax rate could be material The trading price for our Class A common stock and nonvoting Class C capital stock may continue to be volatile The trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile In addition to the factors discussed in this report the trading price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including among others announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions divestitures investments new products significant contracts commercial relationships or capital commitments recommendations by securities analysts or changes in their earnings estimates announcements about our or our competitors earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations the risk of which is enhanced in our case because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings commentary by industry and market professionals about our products strategies and other matters affecting our business and results regardless of its accuracy the volume of shares of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock available for public sale sales of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock by us or by our stockholders including sales by our directors executive officers and other employees short sales hedging and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock the size timing and share class of any share repurchase program and the perceived values of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock relative to one another In addition the stock market in general which can be affected by various factors including overall economic and political conditions and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock regardless of our actual operating performance ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable 24 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc ITEM 2

OPERATIONS Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K We have omitted discussion of 2018 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Part II Item 7 of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10K Trends in Our Business The following longterm trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results Users behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception contributing to revenue growth and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business Users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats Our users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities such as smartphones wearables and smart home devices and want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing We seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business We generate our advertising revenues increasingly from different channels including mobile and newer advertising formats and the margins from the advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search Additionally as the market for a particular device type or modality matures our revenues may be affected For example growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors including increased market saturation in developed countries which can affect our mobile advertising revenue growth rates We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network Members to increase as our revenues grow and to be affected by changes in device mix geographic mix partner mix partner agreement terms the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points product mix the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels and revenue share terms We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our overall margins As online advertising evolves we continue to expand our product offerings which may affect our monetization As interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve their changing needs Over time we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate For example we have seen an increase in YouTube ads and Google Play ads which monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads As users in developing economies increasingly come online our revenues from international markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues The shift to online as well as the advent of the multidevice world has brought opportunities outside of the US including in emerging markets such as India where we continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets This has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time as regions with emerging markets such as APAC have demonstrated higher revenue growth rates We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets particularly as lowcost mobile devices become more available This trend could impact our margins as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets Our international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US dollar While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings 30 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc The portion of our revenues that we derive from nonadvertising revenues is increasing and may affect margins Nonadvertising revenues have grown over time We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our users through products and services like Google Cloud Google Play hardware products and YouTube subscriptions Across these initiatives we currently derive nonadvertising revenues primarily from sales of apps inapp purchases digital content products and hardware and licensing and service fees including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services The margins on these revenues vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues A number of our Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages and as such the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues could be volatile As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures We continue to make significant RD investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising cloud machine learning and search as well as in new products and services In addition we expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets which includes servers and network equipment to support the longterm growth of our business In addition acquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our strategy and use of capital contributing to the breadth and depth of our offerings expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas and building strong partnerships around strategic initiatives For example in 2020 we announced our Google for India Digitization Fund to invest approximately 10 billion into India over the next 57 years through a mix of equity investments partnerships and operational infrastructure and ecosystem investments We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions laws and public policies which could impact our business practices and financial results Changes in social political economic tax and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices As these global trends continue for example the recent antitrust complaints filed by the US Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General as well as the News Media Bargaining Code drafted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission our cost of doing business may increase and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees The Impact of COVID19 on our Results and Operations In late 2019 an outbreak of COVID19 emerged and by March 11 2020 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization Across the United States and the world governments and municipalities instituted measures in an effort to control the spread of COVID19 including quarantines shelterinplace orders school closings travel restrictions and the closure of nonessential businesses The macroeconomic impacts of COVID19 are significant and continue to evolve as exhibited by among other things a rise in unemployment changes in consumer behavior and market volatility We began to observe the impact of COVID19 and the related reductions in global economic activity on our financial results in March 2020 when despite an increase in users search activity our advertising revenues declined compared to the prior year due to a shift of user search activity to less commercial topics and reduced spending by our advertisers During the course of the quarter ended June 30 2020 we observed a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics followed by increased spending by our advertisers that continued throughout the second half of 2020 We continue to assess the realized and potential credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the macroeconomic environment which has been reflected in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable Additionally over the course of the year we experienced variability in our margins as many of our expenses are less variable in nature andor may not correlate to changes in revenues including costs associated with our data centers and facilities as well as employee compensation Also market volatility has contributed to fluctuations in the valuation of our equity investments 31 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc While we continued to make investments in land and buildings for data centers offices and information technology in 2020 we slowed the pace of our investments primarily as it relates to office facilities as a result of COVID19 The ongoing impact of COVID19 on our business continues to evolve and be unpredictable For example to the extent the pandemic disrupts economic activity globally we like other businesses are not immune to continued adverse impacts to our business operations and financial results from volatility in advertising spending changes in user behavior and preferences credit deterioration and liquidity of our customers depressed economic activity or volatility in capital markets The ongoing impact will depend on a number of factors including the duration and severity of the pandemic the uneven impact to certain industries advances in testing treatment and prevention including vaccines and the macroeconomic impact of government measures to contain the spread of the virus and related government stimulus measures To address the potential impact to our business over the nearterm we continue to evaluate the pace of our investment plans including but not limited to our hiring investments in data centers servers network equipment real estate and facilities marketing and travel spending as well as taking certain measures to support our customers our overall workforce and communities we operate in As we look to return our workforce in more locations back to the office in 2021 we may experience increased costs as we prepare our facilities for a safe return to work environment and experiment with hybrid work models At the same time we believe the current environment is accelerating digital transformation and we remain focused on innovating and investing in the services we offer to consumers and businesses For example as it relates to Google Cloud we continue to invest aggressively around the globe in our gotomarket capabilities product development and technical infrastructure to support long term growth The ongoing impact of COVID19 and the extent of these measures we have taken and the additional measures that we may implement could have a material impact on our financial results Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance and historical trends in our financial results may differ materially Executive Overview The following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31 2019 and 2020 in millions except for

advertising revenue growth as well as the change in paid clicks and costperclick on Google Search other properties and the change in impressions and costperimpression on Google Network Members properties and the correlation between these items have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors including advertiser competition for keywords changes in advertising quality formats delivery or policy 33 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc changes in device mix changes in foreign currency exchange rates fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs general economic conditions including the impact of COVID19 seasonality and traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels Our advertising revenue growth rate has been affected over time as a result of a number of factors including challenges in maintaining our growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels changes in our product mix changes in advertising quality or formats and delivery the evolution of the online advertising market increasing competition our investments in new business strategies query growth rates and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences the acceptance by

exchange rates Google advertising revenues consist primarily of the following Google Search other consists of revenues generated on Google search properties including revenues from traffic generated

consists of revenues generated on YouTube properties and Google Network Members properties consist of revenues generated on Google Network Members properties participating in AdMob AdSense and Google Ad Manager Google Search other Google Search other revenues increased 5947 million from 2019 to 2020 The overall growth was primarily driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage primarily on mobile devices growth in advertiser spending primarily in the second half of the year and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery This increase was partially offset by a decline in advertiser spending primarily in the first half of the year driven by the impact of COVID19 YouTube ads YouTube ads revenues increased 4623 million from 2019 to 2020 Growth was primarily driven by our direct response advertising products which benefited from improvements to ad formats and delivery and increased advertiser spending Brand advertising products also contributed to growth despite revenues being adversely impacted by a decline in advertiser spending primarily in the first half of the year driven by the impact of COVID19 Google Network Members properties Google Network Members properties revenues increased 1543 million from 2019 to 2020 The growth was primarily driven by strength in AdMob and Google Ad Manager Use of Monetization Metrics Paid clicks for our Google Search other properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by endusers on Google search properties and other owned and operated properties including Gmail Google Maps and Google Play Historically we included certain viewed YouTube engagement ads and the related revenues in our paid clicks and costperclick monetization metrics Over time advertising on YouTube has expanded to multiple advertising formats and the type of viewed engagement ads historically included in paid clicks and costperclick metrics have increasingly covered a smaller portion of YouTube advertising revenues As a result we removed these ads and the related revenues from the paid clicks and costperclick metrics for the current and historical periods presented The revised metrics provide a better understanding of monetization trends on the properties included within Google Search other as they now more closely correlate with the related changes in revenues Impressions for our Google Network Members properties include impressions displayed to users served on Google Network Members properties participating primarily in AdMob AdSense and Google Ad Manager Costperclick is defined as clickdriven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users 34 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Costperimpression is defined as impressionbased and clickbased revenues divided by our total number of impressions and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users As our business evolves we periodically review refine and update our methodologies for monitoring gathering

to an increase in clicks due to interrelated factors resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage primarily on mobile devices continued growth in advertiser activity and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery Growth was also driven by an increase in clicks relating to ads on Google Play The positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the costperclick paid by our advertisers The decrease in costperclick was primarily driven by reduced advertiser spending in response to COVID19 primarily during the first half of the year The decrease in costperclick was also affected by changes in device mix geographic mix ongoing product changes product mix property mix and fluctuations of the US dollar compared to certain foreign currencies Paid clicks increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to an increase in clicks due to interrelated factors including an increase in search queries resulting from ongoing

Americas 6 5 For further details on revenues by geography see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons Our international revenues are favorably affected as the US dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies and unfavorably affected as the US dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies Our revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and unfavorably affected by net hedging losses We use nonGAAP constant currency revenues and nonGAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decisionmaking and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a yearonyear basis Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods These results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with GAAP Results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP 36 Table of Contents

acquisition costs primarily for YouTube This increase was partially offset by a decline in hardware costs The increase in TAC from 2019 to 2020 was due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network Members driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC The TAC rate was 223 in both 2019 and 2020 The TAC rate on Google properties revenues and the TAC rate on Google Network revenues were both substantially consistent from 2019 to 2020 Over time cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues may be affected by a number of factors including the following The amount of TAC paid to distribution partners which is affected by changes in device mix geographic mix partner mix partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points The amount of TAC paid to Google Network Members which is affected by a combination of factors such as geographic mix product mix and revenue share terms

interest income of 562 million Over time other income expense net may be affected by market dynamics and other factors Equity values generally change daily for marketable equity securities and upon the occurrence of observable price changes or upon impairment of nonmarketable equity securities In addition volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets including the effects of

tax rate 133 162 Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from 2019 to 2020 The increase in the provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits related to the resolution of multiyear audits in 2019 that did not recur in 2020 higher earnings in countries that have higher statutory rates resulting from the change in our corporate legal entity structure implemented as of December 31 2019 and an increase in valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized relating to certain of our Other Bets

changes in our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors See Note 10 included in Part II Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10K for more information on our commitments and contingencies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP In doing so we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses gains and losses as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities In some cases we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates In some cases changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period Accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our financial condition or results of operations will be affected We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates which we discuss further below We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and compliance committee of our Board of Directors Please see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements 45 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Revenues For the sale of thirdparty goods and services we evaluate whether we are the principal and report revenues on a gross basis or an agent and report revenues on a net basis In this assessment we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment inventory risk and discretion in establishing price Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the US and foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties In addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes Loss Contingencies We are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving competition intellectual property privacy tax and related compliance labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms personal injury consumer protection and other matters Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements We evaluate on a regular basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters Until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows Longlived Assets Longlived assets including property and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value Fair Value Measurements We measure certain of our nonmarketable equity and debt investments certain other instruments including stockbased compensation awards settled in the stock of certain Other Bets and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination at fair value on a nonrecurring basis The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value whereby it gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs We maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs Our use of unobservable inputs reflects the assumptions that market participants would use and may include our own data adjusted based on reasonably available information We apply judgment in assessing the relevance of observable market data to determine the priority of inputs under the fair value hierarchy particularly in situations where there is very little or no market activity 46 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc In determining the fair values of our nonmarketable equity and debt investments as well as assets acquired especially with respect to intangible assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations we make significant estimates and assumptions some of which include the use of unobservable inputs Certain stockbased compensation awards may be settled in the stock of certain of our Other Bets or in cash These awards are based on the equity values of the respective Other Bet which requires use of unobservable inputs We also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns ie performance fees We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and may require the use of unobservable inputs Nonmarketable Equity Securities Our nonmarketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried either at fair value or under the measurement alternative Under the measurement alternative the carrying value is measured at cost less any impairment plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer Determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and obligations of the securities Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates Nonmarketable equity securities are also subject to periodic impairment reviews Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the investments fair value Qualitative factors considered include the companies financial and liquidity position access to capital resources and the time since the last adjustment to fair value among others When indicators of impairment exist we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our equity investments using both the market and income approaches which require judgment and the use of estimates including discount rates investee revenues and costs and comparable market data of private and public companies among others When our assessment indicates that an impairment exists we write down the investment to its fair value Change in Accounting Estimate In January 2021 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and determined we should adjust the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from three years to five years This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021 For assets that are inservice as of December 31 2020 we expect operating results to be favorably impacted by approximately 21 billion for the full fiscal year 2021 The effect of the change may be different due to our capital investments during the fiscal year 2021 ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity investment risks Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies Our international revenues as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar British pound Canadian dollar Euro and Japanese yen For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 could be experienced in the near term We use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary These forward contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts If an adverse 10 foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets liabilities and commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date it would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately 8 million and 497 million as of 47 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc December 31 2019 and 2020 respectively after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended December 31 2019 and 2020 We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts including collars an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options to protect our forecasted US dollarequivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates When the US dollar strengthens gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings When the US dollar weakens losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings These hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur If the US dollar weakened by 10 as of December 31 2019 and 2020 the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately 11 billion and 912 million lower as of December 31 2019 and 2020 respectively The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations If the US dollar weakened by 10 the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment CTA within AOCI related to our net investment hedge would have been approximately 936 million and 1 billion lower as of December 31 2019 and 2020 respectively The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries Interest Rate Risk Our Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity We invest primarily in debt securities including those of the US government and its agencies corporate debt securities mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governments By policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase For certain fixed and variable rate debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense net We measure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold less any expected credit losses We use valueatrisk VaR analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable debt security portfolio The VaR is the expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates We use a variancecovariance VaR model with 95 confidence interval The estimated oneday loss in fair value of our marketable debt securities as of December 31 2019 and 2020 are shown below in millions As of December 31 12Month Average As of December 31 2019 2020 2019 2020 Risk Category Interest Rate 104 144 90 145 Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of December 31 2019 and 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation Equity Investment Risk Our marketable and nonmarketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our nonmarketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages 48 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc We record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility and represent 33 billion and 59 billion of our investments as of December 31 2019 and 2020 respectively A hypothetical adverse price change of 30 on our December 31 2020 balance which could be experienced in the near term would decrease the fair value of our marketable equity securities by 18 billion From time to time we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities Our nonmarketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment referred to as the measurement alternative The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date These investments especially those that are in the early stages are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a decline in financial condition which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of our investments through liquidity events such as public offerings acquisitions private sales or other market events As of December 31 2019 and 2020 the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities which were accounted for under the measurement alternative was 114 billion and 189 billion respectively Valuations of our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant impairment charge relating to our nonmarketable equity securities Changes in valuation of nonmarketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities Additionally observable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses on our nonmarketable equity securities The effect of COVID19 on our impairment assessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the impact The carrying values of our equity method investments which totaled approximately 13 billion and 14 billion as of December 31 2019 and 2020 respectively generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes however these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover For further information about our equity investments please refer to Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part

Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003 In 2015 we implemented a holding company reorganization and as a result Alphabet Inc Alphabet became the successor issuer to Google We generate revenues by delivering relevant costeffective online advertising cloudbased solutions that provide customers with platforms collaboration tools and services and sales of other products and services such as apps and inapp purchases digital content and subscriptions for digital content and hardware Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated Use of Estimates Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes Actual results could differ materially from these estimates On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to the allowance for credit losses fair values of financial instruments including nonmarketable equity securities intangible assets and goodwill useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment income taxes and contingent liabilities among others We base our estimates on assumptions both historical and forward looking that are believed to be reasonable the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities As of December 31 2020 the impact of COVID19 continues to unfold and the extent of the impact will depend on a number of factors including the duration and severity of the pandemic the uneven impact to certain industries advances in testing treatment and prevention and the macroeconomic impact of government measures to contain the spread of the virus and related government stimulus measures As a result certain of our estimates and assumptions including the allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable the credit worthiness of customers entering into revenue arrangements the valuation of nonmarketable equity securities including our impairment assessment and the fair values of our financial instruments require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility that could result in material changes to our estimates in future periods In January 2021 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and determined we should adjust the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from three years to five years This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021 Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues Advertising Revenues We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on Google Search other properties including Googlecom the Google Search app Google Play Gmail and Google Maps YouTube and Google Network Members properties Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform among others We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement such as a click a view or a purchase For brand advertising we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed or a user views the ad For ads placed on Google Network Members properties we evaluate whether we are the principal ie report revenues on a gross basis or agent ie report revenues on a net basis Generally we report advertising revenues 59 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc for ads placed on Google Network Members properties on a gross basis that is the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues and amounts paid to Google Network Members are recorded as cost of revenues Where we are the principal we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing Google Cloud Revenues Google Cloud revenues consist primarily of fees received for Google Cloud Platform services which includes infrastructure and data analytics platform products and other services and Google Workspace formerly G Suite collaboration tools and other enterprise services Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services based on the quantity of services consumed Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services Other Revenues Google other revenues and Other Bets revenues consist primarily of revenues from Google Play which includes revenues from sale of apps and inapp purchases which we recognize net of payout to developers and digital content sold in the Google Play store hardware including Google Nest home products Pixelbooks Pixel phones and other devices YouTube nonadvertising services including YouTube premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services and other products and services As it relates to Google other revenues the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and inapp purchases through the Google Play store We report revenues from these transactions on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users for which we earn a commission Consequently the portion of the gross amount billed to end users that is remitted to app developers is not reflected as revenues Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations For such arrangements we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin Customer Incentives and Credits Certain customers receive cashbased incentives or credits which are accounted for as variable consideration We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration Sales Commissions We expense sales commissions when incurred when the amortization period is one year or less We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and amortize it over the period of expected benefit These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues TAC represents the amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services and amounts paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties Our distribution partners include browser providers mobile carriers original equipment manufacturers and software developers Other cost of revenues which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC includes the following Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube advertising and subscription services and Google Play We pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee 60 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Expenses associated with our data centers and other operations including bandwidth compensation expense including SBC depreciation energy and other equipment costs and Inventory related costs for hardware we sell Software Development Costs We expense software development costs including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold leased or marketed to external users before technological feasibility is reached Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud based applications used to deliver our services We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented Stockbased Compensation Stockbased compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units RSUs RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date We recognize RSU expense using the straightline attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur For RSUs shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees As a result fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding and the tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paidin capital Additionally stockbased compensation also includes other stockbased awards such as performance stock units PSUs and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bets PSUs and certain Other Bet awards are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period Certain Other Bet awards are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement The fair value of Other Bet awards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet Advertising and Promotional Expenses We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred For the years ended December 31 2018 2019 and 2020 advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately 64 billion 68 billion and 54 billion respectively Performance Fees Performance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns We recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized Performance fees which are primarily related to gains on equity securities are recorded as a component of other income expense net Certain Risks and Concentrations Our revenues are primarily derived from online advertising the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing In addition our revenues are generated from a multitude of markets in countries around the world Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results No individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10 of our revenues in 2018 2019 or 2020 In 2018 2019 and 2020 we generated approximately 46 46 and 47 of our revenues respectively from customers based in the US We are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents marketable securities foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness credit limits and use of collateral management Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits money market and other funds highly liquid debt instruments of the US government and its agencies debt instruments issued by foreign governments debt instruments issued by municipalities in the US corporate debt securities mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from 61 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc customers located around the world We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend We generally do not require collateral from our customers Fair Value of Financial Instruments Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents marketable securities derivative contracts and nonmarketable debt securities Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include nonmarketable equity securities which are adjusted to fair value when observable price changes are identified or when the nonmarketable equity securities are impaired referred to as the measurement alternative Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed if required Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants As such fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a threetier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets Level 2 Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data Where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates and credit ratings Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value Cash Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We invest all excess cash primarily in government bonds corporate debt securities mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities time deposits and money market funds We classify all marketable debt securities that have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as availableforsale After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives as well as our liquidity requirements we may sell these debt securities prior to their stated maturities As we view these securities as available to support current operations we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets We carry these securities at fair value and report the unrealized gains and losses net of taxes as a component of stockholders equity except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses which are recorded in other income expense net For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense net We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income expense net Our investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses realized and unrealized recognized in other income expense net Accounts Receivable Our payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant For certain products or services and customers we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer 62 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations We also consider customerspecific information current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data For the year ended December 31 2020 our assessment considered the impact of COVID19 and estimates of expected credit and collectibility trends Volatility in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability and volatility that may have a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods The allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable was 275 million and 789 million as of December 31 2019 and 2020 respectively Inventory Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value Cost is computed using the firstin firstout method NonMarketable Investments We account for nonmarketable equity investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method Our nonmarketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative Under the measurement alternative the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investments is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of other income expense net Nonmarketable debt investments are classified as availableforsale securities Nonmarketable investments that do not have stated contractual maturity dates are classified as noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Impairment of Investments We periodically review our debt and nonmarketable equity investments for impairment For debt securities in an unrealized loss position we determine whether a credit loss exists The credit loss is estimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to other income expense net not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI If we have an intent to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of other income expense net For nonmarketable equity securities we consider whether impairment indicators exist by evaluating the companies financial and liquidity position access to capital resources and the time since the last adjustment to fair value among others If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired we write down the investment to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of other income expense net Fair value is estimated using the best information available which may include cash flow projections or other available market data Variable Interest Entities We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity VIE We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or benefits If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP Periodically we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary 63 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Property and Equipment Property and equipment includes the following categories land and buildings information technology assets construction in progress leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures Land and buildings include land offices data centers and related building improvements Information technology assets include servers and network equipment We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation We compute depreciation using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which we regularly evaluate We depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years We depreciate information technology assets generally over periods of three to five years specifically three years for servers and three to five years for network equipment We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use Depreciation for equipment buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use Land is not depreciated Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception Our lease agreements generally contain lease and nonlease components Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed Nonlease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities We combine fixed payments for nonlease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities Certain lease agreements contain variable payments which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index payments contingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements and payments for maintenance and utilities Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in economic environments where the leased asset is located Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option We generally use the base noncancelable lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning January 1 2019 The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the long term portion is included in operating lease liabilities Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment net Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or longterm debt Operating lease expense excluding variable lease costs is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term LongLived Assets Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets We review property and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets excluding goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate If the carrying value of the assets or asset group are not recoverable the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value Impairments were not material for the periods presented We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination We evaluate our reporting units periodically as well as when changes in our operating segments occur For changes in reporting units we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired Goodwill impairments were no t material for the periods presented Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives We amortize intangible assets on a straightline basis with definite lives generally over periods ranging from one to twelve years 64 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that based on technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority In addition we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision Business Combinations We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill Acquisitionrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred Foreign Currency Generally the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to US dollars using monthend exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average rates for the annual period derived from monthend exchange rates for revenues costs and expenses We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI as a component of stockholders equity We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain loss in other income expense net Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No 201613 ASU 201613 Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses Topic 326 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost ASU 201613 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forwardlooking information to calculate credit loss estimates It also eliminates the concept of otherthantemporary impairment and requires credit losses related to certain availableforsale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities These changes result in earlier recognition of credit losses We adopted ASU 201613 using the modified retrospective approach as of January 1 2020 The cumulative effect upon adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements See Impairment of Investments and Accounts Receivable above as well as Note 3 for the effect on our consolidated financial statements Prior

Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other Our total deferred revenue as of December 31 2019 was 23 billion of which 18 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31 2020 Additionally we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts primarily related to Google Cloud for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues also referred to as remaining performance obligations Remaining performance obligations include related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes i contracts with an original expected term of one year or less ii cancellable contracts and iii contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed As of December 31 2020 the amount not yet recognized as revenues from these commitments is 298 billion We expect to recognize approximately half over the next 24 months with the remaining thereafter However the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by when the customer utilizes the services and our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms which could impact our estimate of the remaining performance obligations and when we expect to recognize such as revenues 66 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Note 3 Financial Instruments Debt Securities We classify our marketable debt securities which are accounted for as availableforsale within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense net The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts Unrealized net gains related to debt securities still held where we have elected the fair value option were 87 million as of December 31 2020 As of December 31 2020 the fair value of these

Note 7 for further details on other income expense net Equity Investments The following discusses our marketable equity securities nonmarketable equity securities gains and losses on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity method Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets Our nonmarketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values The carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment referred to as the measurement alternative Nonmarketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility rights and obligations of the securities we hold The fair value of nonmarketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3 Gains and losses on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities Gains and losses

impairment are included as a component of other income expense net in the Consolidated Statements of Income See Note 7 for further details on other income expense net Derivative Financial Instruments We enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations The primary risk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows earnings and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy We present our collar contracts an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options at net fair values where both the purchased and written options are with the same counterparty For other derivative contracts we present at gross fair values We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income expense net or revenues or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI as discussed below We enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty Further we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability Cash and noncash 70 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc collateral pledged related to derivative

business to facilitate transactions in our services and products we indemnify certain parties including advertisers Google Network Members customers of Google Cloud offerings and lessors with respect to certain matters We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim In addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement Additionally we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position However to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period As of December 31 2020 we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible Legal Matters Antitrust Investigations On November 30 2010 the ECs Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrustrelated complaints against us On June 27 2017 the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law The EC decision imposed a 24 billion 27 billion as of June 27 2017 fine On September 11 2017 we appealed the EC decision and on September 27 2017 we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the ECs decision We recognized a charge of 27 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017 On July 18 2018 the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Googles Androidrelated distribution agreements infringed European competition law The EC decision imposed a 43 billion 51 billion as of June 30 2018 fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue On October 9 2018 we appealed the EC decision On October 29 2018 we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices We recognized a charge of 51 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018 On March 20 2019 the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law The EC decision imposed a fine of 15 billion 17 billion as of March 20 2019 and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners agreements which we implemented prior to the decision On June 4 2019 we appealed the EC decision We recognized a charge of 17 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019 82 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc While each EC decision is under appeal we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees in lieu of a cash payment for the fines From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition matters by regulatory authorities in the United States Europe and other jurisdictions For example in August 2019 we began receiving civil investigative demands from the US Department of Justice DOJ requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20 2020 alleging that Google violated US antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising Separately on December 16 2020 a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated US antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology We believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously The DOJ and state Attorneys General continue their investigations into certain aspects of our business We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the United States and other regulators around the world Patent and Intellectual Property Claims We have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe others intellectual property rights Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services As a result we may have to change our business practices and develop noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business In addition the US International Trade Commission ITC has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the US Because the US is an important market a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important products into the US or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products Furthermore many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property infringement claims which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims In addition our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business In 2010 Oracle America Inc Oracle brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California alleging that Googles Android operating system infringes Oracles copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces After trial final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8 2016 and the court decided posttrial motions in favor of Google Oracle appealed and on March 27 2018 the appeals court reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages On May 29 2018 we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit and on August 28 2018 the Federal Circuit denied the petition On January 24 2019 we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review this case On April 29 2019 the Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition On September 27 2019 the Solicitor General recommended denying our petition and we provided our response on October 16 2019 On November 15 2019 the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in our case on October 7 2020 If the Supreme Court does not rule in our favor the case will be remanded to the district court for further determination of the remaining issues in the case including damages if any We believe this lawsuit is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously Given the nature of this case we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss if any arising from this matter Other We are also regularly subject to claims suits regulatory and government investigations and other proceedings involving competition intellectual property privacy tax and related compliance labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users

developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments as appropriate Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters With respect to our outstanding matters based on our current knowledge we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows However the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred NonIncome Taxes We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to nonincome tax matters The subject matter of nonincome tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits We accrue nonincome taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the reasonably possible loss Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations For information regarding income tax contingencies see Note 14 Note 11 Stockholders Equity Convertible Preferred Stock Our Board of Directors has authorized 100 million shares of convertible preferred stock 0001 par value issuable in series As of December 31 2019 and 2020 no shares were issued or outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock Our Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical except with respect to voting Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share Class C capital stock has no voting rights except as required by applicable law Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock Share Repurchases In July 2020 the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional 280 billion of its Class C capital stock The repurchases are being executed from time to time subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions including through Rule 10b51 plans The repurchase program does not have an expiration date During the years ended December 31 2019 and 2020 we repurchased and subsequently retired 153 million and 215 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of 184 billion and 311 billion respectively Note 12 Net Income Per Share We compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock using the twoclass method Basic net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of shares outstanding during the period Diluted net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares The rights including the liquidation and dividend rights of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock are identical except with respect to voting Furthermore there are a number of 84 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation as well as Delaware law which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock Specifically Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights powers or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment In addition our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors As a result the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares and Class C capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis In the years ended December 31 2018 2019 and 2020 the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock in millions except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and

133 162 Our effective tax rate for 2018 and 2019 was affected significantly by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate because substantially all of the income from foreign operations was earned by an Irish subsidiary As of December 31 2019 we have simplified our corporate legal entity structure and now license intellectual property from the US that was previously licensed from Bermuda resulting in an increase in the portion of our income earned in the US On July 27 2015 the United States Tax Court in an opinion in Altera Corp v Commissioner invalidated the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring relatedparty participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stockbased compensation costs The US Tax Court issued the final decision on December 28 2015 As a result of that decision we recorded a tax benefit related to the anticipated reimbursement of cost share payment for previously shared stockbased compensation costs On June 7 2019 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the 2015 Tax Court decision in Altera Corp v Commissioner and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring relatedparty participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stockbased compensation costs As a result of the Ninth Circuit court decision our cumulative net tax benefit of 418 million related to previously shared stockbased compensation costs was reversed in the year ended December 31 2019 In 2020 there was an increase in valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized relating to certain of our Other Bets 88 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Deferred Income Taxes Deferred

utilized the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2023 foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 It is more likely than not that certain net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance against them The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions As of December 31 2020 our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately 37 billion that can be carried over indefinitely We believe the state tax credit is not likely to be realized As of December 31 2020 we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets certain federal net operating losses certain state tax credits net deferred tax assets relating to certain of our Other Bets and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized We continue to reassess the remaining valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly 89 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc Uncertain Tax Positions The following table summarizes the activity

which 29 billion 23 billion and 26 billion if recognized would affect our effective tax rate respectively The decrease in gross unrecognized tax benefits in 2019 was primarily as a result of the resolution of multiyear audits As of December 31 2019 and 2020 we accrued 130 million and 222 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes respectively We file income tax returns in the US federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions our two major tax jurisdictions are the US federal and Ireland We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented The tax years 2011 through 2019 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations However the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs Although the timing of resolution settlement and closure of audits is not certain we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months Note 15 Information about Segments and Geographic Areas Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 we

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10K Based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of December 31 2020 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting We rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating results In 2019 we began a multiyear implementation of a new global ERP system which will replace much of our existing core financial systems The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records enhance the flow of financial information improve data management and provide timely information to our management team The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years The initial phase which included changes to our general ledger and consolidated financial reporting systems was completed during the third quarter of 2020 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting However as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues we will change our processes and procedures which in turn could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting As such changes occur we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting As a result of COVID19 our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for the quarter ended December 31 2020 While preexisting controls were not specifically designed to operate in our current work from home operating environment we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting continue to be effective We have continued to reevaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide reasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a15f of the Exchange Act Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework Based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31 2020 Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2020 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives In addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs ITEM 9B OTHER INFORMATION None 92 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc PART III ITEM 10 DIRECTORS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The information required
