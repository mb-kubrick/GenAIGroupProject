with many regional and local OEMs The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lowervolume PC manufacturers which source Microsoft software for preinstallation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft Direct Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts with sales support from system integrators independent software vendors web agencies and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors or ESA Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small medium and corporate customers in addition to those offered through the reseller channel A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers such as cloud services search and gaming through our digital marketplaces and online stores In June 2020 we announced a strategic change in our retail operations including closing our Microsoft Store physical locations Distributors and Resellers Organizations also license our products and services indirectly primarily through licensing solution partners LSP distributors valueadded resellers VAR and retailers Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations distributors resell primarily to VARs and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent nonexclusive distributors authorized replicators resellers and retail outlets Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets We distribute our devices through thirdparty retailers We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services 14PART IItem 1 LICENSING OPTIONS We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services onpremises software and Software Assurance We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes While these programs may differ in various parts of the

including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stockWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins Competition in the technology sectorOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers Competition among platformbased ecosystemsAn important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions A wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms  A competing verticallyintegrated model in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers tablets phones gaming consoles wearables and other endpoint devices Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer We also offer some verticallyintegrated hardware and software products and services To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins  We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength In addition some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer OEM partners which may affect their commitment to our platform  Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms To compete we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality security customer appeal and value Efforts to compete with competitors content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins Competitors rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives19PART IItem 1A Business model competition Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models  Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure platform and softwareasaservice business model the licensebased proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model  Other competitors develop and offer free applications online services and content and make money by selling thirdparty advertising Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost competing directly with our revenuegenerating products  Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software Some open source software mimics the features and functionality of our products The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives This may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income Our increasing focus on cloudbased services presents execution and competitive risks A growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building bestinclass platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence AI At the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers Pricing and delivery models are evolving Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the users choice of which cloudbased services to use We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloudbased strategies The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things IoT Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure Azure Stack Azure IoT Edge and Azure Sphere We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectivesBesides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved Whether we succeed in cloudbased services depends on our execution in several areas including  Continuing to bring to market compelling cloudbased experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share  Maintaining the utility compatibility and performance of our cloudbased services on the growing array of computing devices including PCs smartphones tablets gaming consoles and other devices as well as sensors and other endpoints  Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to thirdparty developers  Ensuring our cloudbased services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs  Making our suite of cloudbased services platformagnostic available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems including those of our competitors It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income 20PART IItem 1A We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns We will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the Windows operating system Microsoft 365 Office Bing SQL Server Windows Server Azure Office 365 Xbox Live LinkedIn and other products and services We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including PCs tablets gaming devices and HoloLens Investments in new technology are speculative Commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue We may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investments for several years if at all New products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically We may not get engagement in certain features like Edge and Bing that drive postsale monetization opportunities Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences which could negatively impact product and feature adoption product design and product qualityDeveloping new technologies is complex It can require long development and testing periods Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue Acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy For example in October 2018 we completed our acquisition of GitHub Inc GitHub for 75 billion These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees business systems and technology or that they distract management from our other businesses If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable We test goodwill for impairment at least annually Factors that may be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate We have in the past recorded and may in the future be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations 21PART IItem 1A Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our reputation or competitive position Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT These actors may use a wide variety of methods which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware software or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters using social engineering techniques to induce our employees users partners or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users or customers data or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data For example system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users security or systems or reveal confidential informationCyberthreats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers Breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or otherwise adversely affect our businessIn addition our internal IT environment continues to evolve Often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emergeSecurity of our products services devices and customers dataThe security of our products and services is important in our customers decisions to purchase or use our products or services Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers Customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other elements provided by third parties to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue Adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users accounts where accounts share the same attributes as passwords Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access User activity may also result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customers use of our products or services We are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacksTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems our cloudbased services and our customers systems we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide security tools such as firewalls and antivirus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so Customers in certain industries such as financial services health care and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our product and services22PART IItem 1A The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins If we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services data corruption issues or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services Customers and third parties granted access to their systems may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install or enable security patches or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges At times to achieve commercial objectives we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is a security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive positionDisclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users The continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and third parties on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage In addition third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or users or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data onpremises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders In the US and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data perceptions that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions by consumers businesses and government entities Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures In certain cases we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit thus diminishing the value of our products and servicesAbuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement Advertising professional and social platform abuses For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties including GitHub LinkedIn Microsoft Advertising MSN and Xbox Live our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations use of our products or services to spread terrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements23PART IItem 1A Digital safety and service misuseOur hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law We may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing technologies and when discovered by users such content may negatively affect our reputation our brands and user engagement Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight civil or criminal liability or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statementsThe development of the IoT presents security privacy and execution risks To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge we are developing products services and technologies to power the IoT a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors data and computing capabilities including AI The IoTs great potential also carries substantial risks IoT products and services may contain defects in design manufacture or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware sensors processors software and firmware several of which we may not develop or control Each layer including the weakest layer can impact the security of the whole system Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended violate the law or harm individuals or businesses we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions These risks if realized may increase our costs damage our reputation or brands or negatively impact our revenues or margins  Issues in the use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability We are building AI into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices applications and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives As with many disruptive innovations AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business AI algorithms may be flawed Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information Inappropriate or controversial data practices by Microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions These deficiencies could undermine the decisions predictions or analysis AI applications produce subjecting us to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm Some AI scenarios present ethical issues If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights privacy employment or other social issues we may experience brand or reputational harm  We may have excessive outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure Our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power We spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing Azure Microsoft Account services Office 365 Microsoft Teams Dynamics 365 OneDrive SharePoint Online Skype Xbox Live and Outlookcom We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users Maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve Inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data insufficient Internet connectivity or inadequate storage and compute capacity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties regulatory actions damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements We may experience quality or supply problems Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles Surface devices and other devices we design manufacture and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software We could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm as a result of recalls safety alerts or product liability claims if we fail to prevent detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs 24PART IItem 1A Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical functions potentially magnifying the impact of quality or reliability issues Any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challengeWe acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us If a component from a solesource supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint industry shortages legal or regulatory changes or other reasons we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity Component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue Xbox consoles Surface devices datacenter servers and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins These same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure Source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code If our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that code It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factorsLegal changes our evolving business model piracy and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult While piracy adversely affects US revenue the impact on revenue from outside the US is more significant particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights Our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market Similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights Throughout the world we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents Similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations The royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology selling price changes in products using licensed patents or the difficulty of discovering infringements Finally our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue25PART IItem 1A Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights From time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of firstparty devices such as Surface To resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline Besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies In some countries such as Germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives including major new product releases such as Windows 10 significant business transactions warranty or product claims and employment practices Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products As a leading global software and device maker government agencies closely scrutinize us under US and foreign competition laws Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union EU the US and China Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct US federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business The European Commission the Commission closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws For example in 2004 the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products In 2009 the Commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the Commissions concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability The web browsing commitments expired in 2014 The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform and increase our product development costs The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products Our portfolio of firstparty devices continues to grow at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms As a result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase Certain foreign governments particularly in China and other countries in Asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them New competition law actions could be initiated potentially using previous actions as precedent The outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including  We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely 26PART IItem 1A  We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property  We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders consent decrees or other voluntary actions we have taken If we fail to comply with these commitments we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions  Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 postsale monetization opportunities may be limited Our global operations subject us to potential liability under anticorruption trade protection and other laws and regulations The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and other anticorruption laws and regulations AntiCorruption Laws prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls From time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the US and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the US and our compliance with AntiCorruption Laws Periodically we receive such reports directly and investigate them On July 22 2019 our Hungarian subsidiary entered into a nonprosecution agreement NPA with the US Department of Justice DOJ and we agreed to the terms of a cease and desist order with the Securities and Exchange Commission These agreements required us to pay 253 million in monetary penalties disgorgement and interest pertaining to activities at Microsofts subsidiary in Hungary The NPA which has a threeyear term also contains certain ongoing compliance requirements including the obligations to disclose to the DOJ issues that may implicate the FCPA and to cooperate in any inquiries Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves While we devote substantial resources to our US and international compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies Our failure to comply with AntiCorruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation Operations outside the US may be affected by changes in trade protection laws policies sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of US trade sanctions on restricted entities or countries such as Crimea Cuba Iran North Korea Sudan and Syria Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy telecommunications data storage and protection and online content For example some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as Microsoft Teams and Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services and some new laws including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection security and law enforcement surveillance obligations Data protection authorities may assert that our collection use and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services Legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of AI and content moderation increasing costs or restricting opportunity Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction Additionally these laws and governments approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups regulators competitors customers and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible If our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions27PART IItem 1A Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs legal claims fines against us or reputational damage The growth of our Internet and cloudbased services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries Legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve For example in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated a framework called Privacy Shield for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the United States This ruling has led to uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU under other legal mechanisms Potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets In May 2018 the EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR became effective The law which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR or other data regulations or if our implementation to comply with the GDPR makes our offerings less attractive The GDPR imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them If we fail to comply with the GDPR or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the GDPR it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue private lawsuits reputational damage and loss of customers Countries around the world and states in the US such as California have adopted or are considering adopting or expanding laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal dataThe Companys investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment Ongoing legal analyses reviews and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices or relevant practices of other organizations may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements including data sovereignty and localization requirements affecting the location movement collection and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort We may have additional tax liabilities We are subject to income taxes in the US and many foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes In the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain For example compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statementsWe regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken In addition economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing The final resolution of those audits and other audits or litigation may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made 28PART IItem 1A We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the US A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our business or structure or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company In addition changes in US federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries including in the US and changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements If our reputation or our brands are damaged our business and operating results may be harmed Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer business and publicsector customers There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged These include product safety or quality issues or our environmental impact and sustainability supply chain practices or human rights record We may experience backlash from customers government entities advocacy groups employees and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from among other things  The introduction of new features products services or terms of service that customers users or partners do not like Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy data practices or content  Data security breaches compliance failures or actions of partners or individual employees The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood speed and magnitude of negative brand events If our brands or reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our revenues or margins or ability to attract the most highly qualified employeesOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks Our results of operations may be affected by global regional and local economic developments monetary policy inflation and recession as well as political and military disputes In addition our international growth strategy includes certain markets the developing nature of which presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations Emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism protectionism or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs local sourcing initiatives or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties We derive substantial revenue from government contracts Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements For instance we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval reductions or delays which could adversely impact publicsector demand for our products and services These events could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and reputation Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business Worsening economic conditions including inflation recession pandemic or other changes in economic conditions may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue If demand for PCs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution The impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor OEM or retailer could cause sales channel disruption 29PART IItem 1A Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased As a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities These investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises US government securities If global financial markets decline for long periods or if there is a downgrade of the US government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an otherthantemporary decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statementsCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions Our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle Washington area and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California both of which are seismically active regions A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems or the infrastructure or systems they rely on such as power grids could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements Abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies access to global markets hiring and profitability Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some publicsector customers Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations financial condition and results of operations The COVID19 pandemic is having widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus including social distancing travel restrictions border closures limitations on public gatherings work from home supply chain logistical changes and closure of nonessential businesses To protect the health and wellbeing of our employees suppliers and customers we have made substantial modifications to employee travel policies implemented office closures as employees are advised to work from home and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtualonly through fiscal year 2021 The COVID19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations including our employees customers partners and communities and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over timeIn the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020 we have experienced adverse impacts to our supply chain a slowdown in transactional licensing and lower demand for our advertising services The extent to which the COVID19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals actions in response to the pandemic and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability These factors may adversely impact consumer business and government spending on technology as well as customers ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis This uncertainty also affects managements accounting estimates and assumptions which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions including investments receivables and forwardlooking guidance30PART IItem 1A Measures to contain the virus that impact us our partners distributors and suppliers may further intensify these impacts and other risks described in these Risk Factors Any of these may adversely impact our ability to Maintain our operations infrastructure including the reliability and adequate capacity of cloud services Satisfy our contractual and regulatory compliance obligations as we adapt to changing usage patterns such as through datacenter load balancing  Ensure a highquality and consistent supply chain and manufacturing operations for our hardware devices and datacenter operations Effectively manage our international operations through changes in trade practices and policies Hire and deploy people where we most need them Sustain the effectiveness and productivity of our operations including our sales marketing engineering and distribution functionsWe may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business If we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our revenues cash flows market share growth and reputationThe longterm effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear Environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased servicesOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive Maintaining our brand and reputation as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws Changes to US immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected Effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution How employmentrelated laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs    31PART IItem 1B 2 3 4 ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff

Conditions Challenges and RisksThe markets for software devices and cloudbased services are dynamic and highly competitive Our competitors are developing new software and devices while also deploying competing cloudbased services for consumers and businesses The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the users choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating marginsOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment broad customer reach scale in resources the ability to grow ones career across many different products and businesses and competitive compensation and benefits Aggregate demand for our software services and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors which remain dynamicOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar As a result changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses Strengthening of the US dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not significantly impact reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2019 and reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2019 Strengthening of the US dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2020Refer to Risk Factors Part I Item 1A of this Form 10K for a discussion of these factors and other risksCOVID19In fiscal year 2020 the COVID19 pandemic impacted our business operations including our employees customers partners and communities and we saw the following trends in our financial operating results In the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments cloud usage and demand increased as customers shifted to work and learn from home We also experienced a slowdown in transactional licensing particularly in small and medium businesses and LinkedIn was negatively impacted by the weak job market and reductions in advertising spend In the More Personal Computing segment Windows OEM Surface and Gaming benefited from increased demand to support remote work play and learnfromhome scenarios while Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend The COVID19 pandemic may continue to

TAXES Effective Tax RateFiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was 17 and 10 respectively The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a 26 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers Our effective tax rate was lower than the US federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico and tax benefits relating to stockbased compensationThe mix of income before income taxes between the US and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services In fiscal year 2020 our US income before income taxes was 241 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 289 billion In fiscal year 2019 our US income before income taxes was 158 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 279 billionFiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018 Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 10 and 55 respectively The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and a 26 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers Our effective tax rate was lower than the US federal statutory rate primarily due to the tax benefit related to intangible property transfers and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland Singapore and Puerto RicoThe mix of income before income taxes between the US and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services In fiscal year 2019 our US income before income taxes was 158 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 279 billion In fiscal year 2018 our US income before income taxes was 115 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 249 billionTax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22 2017 the TCJA was enacted into law which significantly changed existing US tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business We recorded a provisional net charge of 137 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018 and adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of 157 million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118 In fiscal year 2019 in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the US and Ireland The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a 26 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and US global intangible lowtaxed income taxRefer to Note 12  Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K for further discussion45PART IIItem 7 Uncertain Tax PositionsWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011 In February 2012 the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016 and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018 We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013 In April 2020 the IRS commenced the audit for tax years 2014 to 2017 As of June 30 2020 the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months Based on the information currently available we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 monthsWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the US Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2019 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statementsNONGAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESNonGAAP net income and diluted EPS are nonGAAP financial measures which exclude the net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties in fiscal year 2019 and the net tax impact of the TCJA in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 We believe these nonGAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business For comparability of reporting management considers nonGAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance These nonGAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial

Equity investments were 30 billion and 26 billion as of June 30 2020 and 2019 respectively Our shortterm investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation They consist predominantly of highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers The investments are predominantly US dollardenominated securities but also include foreign currencydenominated securities to diversify risk Our fixedincome investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk The credit risk and average maturity of our fixedincome portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixedincome indices The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the shortterm investments held are primarily highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities Valuation In general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments such as US government securities common and preferred stock and mutual funds If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper certificates of deposit US agency securities foreign government bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities corporate notes and bonds and municipal securities Level 3 investments are valued using internallydeveloped models with unobservable inputs Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades Our brokerpriced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments In addition all our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded These controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019Cash from operations increased 85 billion to 607 billion for fiscal

cash paid to suppliers and employees and an increase in cash paid for income taxes Cash used in financing increased 33 billion to 369 billion for fiscal year 2019 mainly due to an 88 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a 11 billion increase in dividends paid offset in part by a 62 billion decrease in repayments of debt net of proceeds from issuance of debt Cash used in investing increased 97 billion to 158 billion for fiscal year 2019 mainly due to a 60 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases sales and maturities a 23 billion increase in additions to property and equipment and a 15 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies net of cash acquired and purchases of intangible and other assetsDebt We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes which may include among other things funding for working capital capital expenditures repurchases of capital stock acquisitions and repayment of existing debt In June 2020 we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate

to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy Additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities datacenters and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings We have operating and finance leases for datacenters corporate offices research and development facilities retail stores and certain equipment We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources LiquidityAs a result of the TCJA we are required to pay a onetime transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to US income tax Under the TCJA the transition tax is payable in interestfree installments over eight years with 8 due in each of the first five years 15 in year six 20 in year seven and 25 in year eight We have paid transition tax of 32 billion which included 12 billion for fiscal year 2020 The remaining transition tax of 152 billion is payable over the next six years with a final payment in fiscal year 2026 During fiscal year 2020 we also paid 37 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 201949PART IIItem 7 We expect existing cash cash

foreseeable future RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE Refer to Note 1  Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K for further discussionAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies as well as uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of COVID19 Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs contingencies income taxes and inventories Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment When a cloudbased service includes both onpremises software licenses and cloud services judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time Certain cloud services primarily Office 365 depend on a significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services and are accounted for together as one performance obligation Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price SSP for each distinct performance obligation We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately including onpremises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services In instances where SSP is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances In these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers Our products are generally sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or incentives and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented 50PART IIItem 7 Impairment of Investment Securities We review debt investments quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment This determination requires significant judgment In making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery In addition we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors Once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established If market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss Once an investment is determined to be impaired an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis May 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology This analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product Once technological feasibility is established software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing Generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to production The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 51PART IIItem 7 Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statementsIncome Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements The TCJA significantly changes existing US tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business Refer to Note 12  Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K for further discussionInventories Inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion disposal and transportation We regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenueCHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATEIn July 2020 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021 Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in Property and equipment net as of June 30 2020 it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2021 operating income by 27 billion 52PART IIItem

customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software Revenue from distinct onpremises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge revenue is recognized as the updates are provided which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or licenseCertain volume licensing programs including Enterprise Agreements include onpremises licenses combined with Software Assurance SA SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support tools and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently Onpremises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time  Cloud services which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis such as the amount of storage used in a period is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided Our hardware is generally highly dependent on and interrelated with the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system In these cases the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces Refer to Note 19  Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information including revenue by significant product and service offeringSignificant JudgmentsOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment When a cloudbased service includes both onpremises software licenses and cloud services judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time Certain cloud services primarily Office 365 depend on a significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services and are accounted for together as one performance obligation Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided61PART IIItem 8 Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately including onpremises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services In instances where SSP is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances In these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP  Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers  Our products are generally sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or incentives and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presentedContract Balances  Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing For multiyear agreements we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multiyear onpremises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses As of June 30 2020 and 2019 longterm accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was 27 billion and 22 billion respectively and is included in other longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheetsThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts historical experience and other currently available evidence Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows  In millions       Year Ended June 30  2020   2019   2018           Balance beginning of period 434  397  361 Charged to costs and other  560   153   134 Writeoffs  178  116  98                       Balance end of period 816  434    397               Allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets In

assets  28   23   20                        Total   816      434    397               62PART IIItem 8 Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs which may include SA and cloud services Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multiyear agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future LinkedIn subscriptions Office 365 subscriptions Xbox Live subscriptions Windows 10 postdelivery support Dynamics business solutions Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service Refer to Note 13  Unearned Revenue for further information including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the periodPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period and multiyear onpremises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries As of June 30 2020 and 2019 our financing receivables net were 52 billion and 43 billion respectively for shortterm and longterm financing receivables which are included in other current assets and other longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts historical experience and other currently available evidence Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a CustomerWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activitiesCost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers OEM to drive traffic to our websites and to acquire online advertising space costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services including datacenter costs and royalties warranty costs inventory valuation adjustments costs associated with the delivery of consulting services and the amortization of capitalized software development costs Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized For hardware warranties we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates historical and projected repair costs and knowledge of specific product failures if any The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years For software warranties we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes such as security patches over the estimated life of the software We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 63PART IIItem 8 Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll employee benefits stockbased compensation expense and other headcountrelated expenses associated with product development Research and development expenses also include thirdparty development and programming costs localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets and the amortization of purchased software code and services content Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached which for our software products is generally shortly before the products are released to production Once technological feasibility is reached such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll employee benefits stockbased compensation expense and other headcountrelated expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel and the costs of advertising promotions trade shows seminars and other programs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred Advertising expense was 16 billion in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 StockBased Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards which include restricted stock units RSUs and performance stock units PSUs is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense net of estimated forfeitures over the related service or performance period The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straightline method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated methodCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan ESPP is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchaseIncome Taxes Income tax expense includes US and international income taxes and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized All deferred income taxes are classified as longterm in our consolidated balance sheets Financial InstrumentsInvestmentsWe consider all highly liquid interestearning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values In general investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as shortterm investments Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as shortterm based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 64PART IIItem 8 Debt investments are classified as availableforsale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method Changes in fair value excluding otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in other comprehensive income Debt investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be otherthantemporary Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery In addition we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors Once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments referred to as the measurement alternative We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value Changes in value are recorded in other income expense net DerivativesDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges gains and losses are recognized in other income expense net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income expense netFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings with the corresponding hedged item Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income expense netFair Value MeasurementsWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety These levels are  Level 1  inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets Our Level 1 investments include US government securities common and preferred stock and mutual funds Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges  Level 2  inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques eg the BlackScholes model for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities Where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves credit spreads foreign exchange rates and forward and spot prices for currencies Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper certificates of deposit US agency securities foreign government bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities corporate notes and bonds and municipal securities Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain overthecounter option and swap contracts 65PART IIItem 8  Level 3  inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability The fair values are therefore determined using modelbased techniques including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds municipal securities and goodwill and intangible assets when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available and may include quoted market prices market comparables and discounted cash flow projections Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying valuesInventories Inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion disposal and transportation We regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows computer software developed or acquired for internal use three to seven years computer equipment two to three years buildings and improvements five to 15 years leasehold improvements three to 20 years and furniture and equipment one to 10 years Land is not depreciated LeasesWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception Operating leases are included in operating lease rightofuse ROU assets other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets Finance leases are included in property and equipment other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term We have lease agreements with lease and nonlease components which are generally accounted for separately For certain equipment leases such as vehicles we account for the lease and nonlease components as a single lease component Additionally for certain equipment leases we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis May 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 66PART IIItem 8 Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated period of benefit ranging from one to 20 years We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired Recent Accounting Guidance Recently Adopted Accounting GuidanceFinancial Instruments  Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities In August 2017 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging activities This guidance expands strategies that qualify for hedge accounting changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial statements and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain situations We adopted the standard effective July 1 2019 As we did not hold derivative instruments requiring an adjustment upon adoption there was no impact in our consolidated financial statements Adoption of the standard enhanced the presentation of the effects of our hedging instruments and the hedged items in our consolidated financial statements to increase the understandability of the results of our hedging strategiesRecent Accounting Guidance Not Yet AdoptedFinancial Instruments  Credit Losses In June 2016 the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates We will be required to use a forwardlooking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable loans and other financial instruments Credit losses relating to availableforsale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities The standard will be adopted upon the effective date for us beginning July 1 2020 Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard We have evaluated the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements including accounting policies processes and systems We continue to monitor economic implications of the COVID19 pandemic Based on current market conditions adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements Accounting for Income TaxesIn December 2019 the FASB issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for income taxes The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries The guidance also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a stepup in the tax basis of goodwill The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1 2021 with early adoption permitted We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements including accounting policies processes and systems NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share EPS is computed

Class Actions Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia Ontario and Quebec Canada All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software andor productivity application software between 1998 and 2010 The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016 Following a mediation the parties agreed to a global settlement of all three Canadian actions and submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in all three jurisdictions for approval The final settlement has been approved by the courts in British Columbia Ontario and Quebec and the claims administration process will commence once each court approves the form of notice to the class Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims China State Administration for Industry and Commerce Investigation In 2014 Microsoft was informed that Chinas State Agency for Market Regulation SAMR formerly State Administration for Industry and Commerce had begun a formal investigation relating to Chinas AntiMonopoly Law and the SAMR conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing Shanghai Guangzhou and Chengdu The SAMR has presented its preliminary views as to certain possible violations of Chinas AntiMonopoly Law and discussions are expected to continueProductRelated Litigation  US Cell Phone Litigation Microsoft Mobile Oy a subsidiary of Microsoft along with other handset manufacturers and network operators is a defendant in 40 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokias Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pretrial proceedings the remaining cases are stayed In a separate 2009 decision the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the US Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines FCC Guidelines are preempted by federal law The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect The lawsuits also allege an industrywide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines In 2013 the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies In 2014 the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion to exclude the plaintiffs general causation experts The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence In October 2016 the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence portions of which the defendants have moved to strike In August 2018 the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs expert reports A hearing is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 202185PART IIItem 8 Other Contingencies We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us individually or in aggregate will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future As of June 30 2020 we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of 306 million While we intend to defend these matters vigorously adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately 500 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable NOTE 16  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Shares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows

Revenue Service IRS The Company remains under IRS audit or subject to IRS audit for tax years subsequent to 2003 While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Companys financial statements Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code related regulations tax case laws and prioryear audit settlements Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS evaluating managements estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment including involvement of our tax specialistsHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur principal audit procedures to evaluate managements estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of managements methods and assumptions used in the identification recognition measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls  We read and evaluated managements documentation including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions  We tested the reasonableness of managements judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions  For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled we evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions  We evaluated the reasonableness of managements estimates by considering how tax law including statutes regulations and case law impacted managements judgments  s DELOITTE  TOUCHE
