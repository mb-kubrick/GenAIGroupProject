Oregon 970056453 Our principal business activity is the design development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world We sell our products to retail accounts through NIKEowned retail stores and internet websites which we refer to as our Direct to Consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees in virtually all countries around the world Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors Virtually all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad Products We focus our NIKE Brand and Brand Jordan product offerings in seven key categories Running Basketball Football Soccer Mens Training Womens Training NIKE Sportswear our sportsinspired lifestyle products and Action Sports We also market products designed for kids as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as baseball cricket golf lacrosse outdoor activities football tennis volleyball walking and wrestling NIKEs athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes We place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovation in our products NIKE Sportswear Running Basketball Football Soccer and kids shoes are currently our topselling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future We sell sports apparel and accessories covering most of the abovementioned categories which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear We often market footwear apparel and accessories in collections of similar use or by category We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos We sell a line of performance equipment under the NIKE Brand name including bags socks sport balls eyewear timepieces digital devices bats gloves protective equipment golf clubs and other equipment designed for sports activities We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our whollyowned subsidiary NIKE IHM Inc Our whollyowned subsidiary Converse Inc Converse headquartered in North Andover Massachusetts designs distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear apparel and accessories under the Converse Chuck Taylor All Star One Star Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks Our whollyowned subsidiary Hurley International LLC Hurley headquartered in Costa Mesa California designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley trademark In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our Direct to Consumer operations we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell certain apparel digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities As part of our longterm growth strategy we continually evaluate our portfolio of businesses to ensure we are investing in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand with the largest growth potential and highest returns On February 1 2013 and November 30 2012 we completed the divestitures of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses respectively allowing us to better focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE Jordan Converse and Hurley brands Sales and Marketing Financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 18 Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year Historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters However the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment Because NIKE is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products We must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability This is a continuing risk We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services Our reportable operating 1 Table of Contents segments for the NIKE Brand are North America Western Europe Central Eastern Europe Greater China Japan and Emerging Markets Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment United States Market In fiscal 2013 sales in the United States including US sales of our Other Businesses accounted for approximately 45 of total revenues compared to 42 in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 Converse and Hurley our affiliate brands and NIKE Golf comprise our Other Businesses We sell to thousands of retail accounts in the United States including a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts During fiscal 2013 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 25 of sales in the United States We make substantial use of our futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price In fiscal 2013 87 of our US wholesale footwear shipments excluding our Other Businesses were made under the futures program compared to 86 in fiscal 2012 and 87 in fiscal 2011 In fiscal 2013 67 of our US wholesale apparel shipments excluding our Other Businesses were made under the futures program compared to 64 in fiscal 2012 and 60 in fiscal 2011 We utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit sales in the United States as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf skateboarding and snowboarding In addition our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand products to consumers through our internet website wwwnikecom and through the following number of retail stores in the United States US Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores 171 NIKE Brand inline stores including NIKETOWNs and employeeonly stores 33 Converse stores including factory stores 72 Hurley stores including factory and employee stores 27 TOTAL 303 NIKE has five primary distribution centers in the United States located in Memphis Tennessee three of which are leased NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch California distribution center Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from Ontario California International Markets In fiscal 2013 nonUS sales including nonUS sales of our Other Businesses accounted for 55 of total revenues compared to 58 in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 We sell our products to retail accounts through our own Direct to Consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives around the world We sell to thousands of retail accounts and operate 16 distribution centers outside of the United States In many countries and regions including Canada Asia some Latin American countries and Europe we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures ordering program described above During fiscal 2013 NIKEs three largest customers outside of the US accounted for approximately 6 of total nonUS sales Our Direct to Consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outside the United States NonUS Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores 388 NIKE Brand inline stores including NIKETOWNs and employeeonly stores 59 Converse stores including factory stores 3 TOTAL 450 International branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina Australia Austria Belgium Bermuda Brazil Canada Chile China Costa Rica Croatia Cyprus the Czech Republic Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Hong Kong Hungary India Indonesia Ireland Israel Italy Japan Korea Malaysia Mexico New Zealand the Netherlands Norway the Philippines Poland Portugal Russia Singapore Slovakia Slovenia South Africa Spain Sri Lanka Sweden Switzerland Taiwan Thailand Turkey the United Arab Emirates the United Kingdom Uruguay and Vietnam Significant Customer No customer accounted for 10 or more of our worldwide net sales during fiscal 2013 Orders Worldwide futures orders for NIKE Brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2013 were 121 billion compared to 112 billion for the same period last year This futures orders amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above In addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of discounts order cancellations and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues Moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel sales of NIKE Brand equipment sales from our Direct to Consumer operations and sales from our Other Businesses Product Research and Development We believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our success Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as NIKE strives to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort In addition to NIKEs own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world Employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process Manufacturing Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers In fiscal 2013 contract factories in Vietnam China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 42 30 and 26 of total NIKE Brand footwear respectively We also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in Argentina Brazil India and Mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries The largest single footwear factory with which we have contracted accounted for approximately 6 of total fiscal 2013 NIKE Brand footwear production Almost all of NIKE Brand apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers located in 28 countries Most of this apparel production occurred in China Vietnam Thailand Indonesia Sri Lanka Pakistan Malaysia Turkey Mexico and Cambodia The largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 6 of total fiscal 2013 apparel production The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make AirSole cushioning components During fiscal 2013 NIKE IHM Inc a whollyowned subsidiary of NIKE Inc with facilities in Beaverton Oregon and St Louis Missouri as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam were our largest suppliers of the AirSole cushioning components used in footwear The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain and snow retain heat or efficiently wick moisture away from the body NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place We have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements Since 1972 Sojitz Corporation of America Sojitz America a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed significant importexport financing services for us During fiscal 2013 Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in Argentina Uruguay Canada Brazil India Indonesia the Philippines Malaysia South Africa Korea and Thailand excluding products produced and sold in the same country Approximately 13 of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability However we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31 2014 International Operations and Trade Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export and import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism We have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future In recent years uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws Notwithstanding our efforts such protectionist measures if implemented could result in increases in the cost of our products which may in turn adversely affect our sales or profitability as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions In Brazil we are actively monitoring for dumping investigations against products from China and other countries that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may increase customs clearance times for imports of footwear apparel and equipment Moreover with respect to trade restrictions targeting China which represents an important sourcing and consumer marketing country for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers Chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community Where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact However we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability 2 Table of Contents Competition The athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas VF Corp Puma Li Ning and Under Armour among others We also compete with a number of vertical retailers such as Lululemon and Uniqlo The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear apparel and equipment in the world Important aspects of competition in this industry are Product quality performance and reliability new product innovation and development and consumer pricevalue Consumer connection and affinity for brands and products developed through marketing and promotion customer support and service identification with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics and Effective distribution of products with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail in store and online We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas Trademarks and Patents We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying our brands and the Company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions In addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products We continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement NIKE has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented Air technology The process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane Some of the early NIKE AIR patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology Subsequent NIKE AIR patents will not expire for several years We also file and maintain many US and foreign utility patents as well as many US and foreign design patents covering components manufacturing techniques and features used in various athletic and leisure footwear apparel athletic equipment digital devices and golf products These patents expire at various times and patents issued for applications filed this year in the US will last until 2027 for design patents and until 2033 for utility patents We believe our success depends primarily upon our capabilities in design research and development production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent position However we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the United States and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable Employees As of May 31 2013 we had approximately 48000 employees worldwide including retail and parttime employees Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent None of our employees are represented by a union except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union Also in some countries outside of the United States local laws require employee representation by works councils which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions or by organizations similar to a union In certain European countries we are required by local law to enter into andor comply with industrywide or national collective bargaining agreements NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements Executive Officers of the Registrant

including Forms 8K 10Q and 10K and include among others the following international national and local general economic and market conditions the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear apparel and equipment markets intense competition among designers marketers distributors and sellers of athletic footwear apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers demographic changes changes

report and other reports The risks included here are not exhaustive Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance Moreover NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on NIKEs business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements Given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information Accordingly shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report Furthermore NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others Thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE Our products face intense competition NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products The athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive in the United States and on a worldwide basis We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity Our competitors product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production and customer service are areas of intense competition This in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation Maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity In addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations In addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns Negative posts or comments about us on social networking websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image If we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 5 Table of Contents If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits Our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner However long lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories and lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition In addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media and online advertising If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation We rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products Research and development plays a key role in technical innovation We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products While we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems Failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business We establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues to evaluate promote and establish product authenticity with consumers If certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected In addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or negative posts or comments about our sports marketing endorsements on social networking websites could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition In addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products Global capital and credit market conditions and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world Continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets have led to fluctuations in the availability of business credit and capital liquidity a contraction of consumer credit business failures higher unemployment and declines in consumer confidence and spending in many parts of the world If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products reduced orders from retailers for our products order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts increased inventories and lower gross margins We may be unable to find suitable investments that are safe liquid and provide a reasonable return This could result in lower interest income or longer investment horizons Disruptions to capital markets or the banking system may also impair the value of investments or bank deposits we currently consider safe or liquid In the future we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so The failure of financial institution counterparties to honor their obligations to us under credit and derivative instruments could jeopardize our ability to rely on and benefit from those instruments Our ability to replace those instruments on the same or similar terms may be limited under poor market conditions We conduct transactions in various currencies which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US Dollar Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported financial results and condition Continued volatility and availability in the markets and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain such as cotton or petroleum derivatives could have a material adverse effect on our costs gross margins and profitability If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or retailers experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products this could result in reduced orders for our products order cancellations inability of retailers to timely meet their payment obligations to us extended payment terms higher accounts receivable reduced cash flows greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty some may become insolvent and cease business operations which could reduce the availability of our products to consumers If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance general working capital needs it may result in delays or nondelivery of shipments of our products 6 Table of Contents Our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year Historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters However the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment In addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice As a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales Accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period This seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix geographic sales trends and currency exchange rate fluctuations all of which we expect to continue Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues We make substantial use of our futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery We report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports Although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period This is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders In addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations shipping timing returns and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues Moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel sales of NIKE brand equipment sales from our Direct to Consumer operations and sales from our Other Businesses Our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition Conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition generally without requiring collateral To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program These advance orders may be canceled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty In the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties which have had an adverse effect on our business When the retail economy weakens retailers may be more cautious with orders A slowing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition In addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers Retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell our products The athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores These retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid In addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues Our Direct to Consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties Our Direct to Consumer locations have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities Because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than certain of our other stores Due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our Direct to Consumer operations a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs Many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the Companys control pose risks and uncertainties Risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation Risks specific to our ecommerce business also include diversion of sales from our brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating 7 Table of Contents the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our ecommerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions In addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products In addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize on or in the marketing of our products We believe that our trademarks patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights If we are unsuccessful in challenging a partys products on the basis of trade secret misappropriation or trademark copyright design patent utility patent or other intellectual property infringement continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products The actions we take to establish and protect trademarks copyrights trade secrets patents and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights Defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products We take various actions to prevent confidential information from unauthorized use andor disclosure Such actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure agreements and providing confidential information awareness training Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information might not always be effective Confidential information that is related to business strategy new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation a decline in our stock price a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions In addition the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the United States and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources From time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations In addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our trademarks We impose and require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees the contract with manufacturers to make products bearing our trademarks a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety Notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States Accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products In addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad These factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected In addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions Increases in income tax rates could reduce our aftertax income from affected jurisdictions We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction including the United States subject to 8 Table of Contents significant change There have been proposals to reform US tax laws that could significantly impact how US multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals being considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world and any repatriation of nonUS earnings for which we have not previously provided for US taxes The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to significant discretion Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings A majority of our products are sold outside of the United States As a result we conduct transactions in various currencies which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US Dollar Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into US Dollars for consolidated financial reporting Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance Foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger US Dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker US Dollar Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the US Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses As part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions In addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad As a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing The principal materials used in our apparel products natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain or snow retain heat or efficiently wick moisture away from the body are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place The principal materials used in our footwear products natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films are also locally available to manufacturers Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train and employ adequate personnel NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all Further there may be wage increases whether government mandated or otherwise that affect our unaffiliated contract manufacturers In addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner If we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements In addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards Any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm Because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance In addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins In addition Sojitz America performs significant importexport financing services for most of the NIKE Brand products sold outside of the United States Europe Middle East Africa and Japan excluding products produced and sold in the same country Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the United States Europe Middle East Africa and Japan Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 9 Table of Contents Our success depends on our global distribution facilities We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world Our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business We maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy breach interruption or security failure of that technology or any misappropriation of any data could harm our reputation or our ability to effectively operate our business We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the Internet and thirdparty hosted services information technology systems across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems Over a number of years we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate Our work to integrate and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing The failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements If our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage In addition hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data our customers or employees personal information or a disruption of our business which could give rise to unwanted media attention damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits In addition we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data An inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks Furthermore we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing digital commerce and the marketing and use of our Digital Sport products We also engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers Our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown Misuse or leakage of personal information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and damage our reputation and credibility and have a negative impact on revenues and profits The market for prime real estate is competitive Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases In addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition Additionally the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition Natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition Natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes tsunamis or other adverse weather and climate conditions whether occurring in the US or abroad and the consequences and effects thereof including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations or the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns From time to time we may invest in business infrastructure acquisitions of new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our retail operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention We believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability However significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business The failure of any significant investment to provide their expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations We depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel The loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 10 Table of Contents The sale of a large number of shares held by our Chairman could depress the market price of our common stock Philip H Knight Cofounder and Chairman of our Board of Directors beneficially owns over 756 of our Class A Common Stock If all of his Class A Common Stock were converted into Class B Common Stock Mr Knight would own over 158 of our Class B Common Stock These shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the US securities laws The sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options Our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by Standard Poors and Moodys Investors Service If our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to the unsecured credit market could be limited We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility In addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new initiatives Antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect threequarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number However such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company We may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts estimates of our future performance Analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline In the past securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities If our stock price is volatile we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business 11 Table of Contents ITEM 1B Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable ITEM 2 Properties The following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased

singledigit revenue growth Midteens earnings per share growth Increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows and Consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses Over the past ten years we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals During this time revenues and earnings per share for NIKE Inc inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations have grown 9 and 15 respectively on an annual compounded basis Our return on invested capital has increased from 18 to 24 and we expanded gross margins by approximately 260 basis points On November 15 2012 we announced a twoforone stock split of both Class A and Class B Common shares The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 24 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business December 10 2012 Common stock began trading at the splitadjusted price on December 26 2012 All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split Our fiscal 2013 results from continuing operations demonstrated the power of the NIKE Inc portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues earnings and cash returns to shareholders while investing for longterm growth Despite the ongoing challenges in the global economy we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2013 Our revenues grew 8 to 253 billion net income from continuing operations increased 9 to 25 billion and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 269 an 11 increase from fiscal 2012 Earnings before interest and income taxes for continuing operations increased 8 for fiscal 2013 driven by revenue growth and improved gross margin which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue The increase in revenues was driven by growth across most NIKE Brand geographies key categories and product types This growth was primarily fueled by Innovative performance and sportswear products incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air Lunar Shox FREE Flywire DriFIT FlyKnit NIKE and NIKE Fuel Deep brand connections to consumers through a category lens reinforced by investments in endorsements by high profile athletes and teams such as the NFL FC Barcelona Michael Jordan high impact marketing around global sporting events such as the Olympics European Football Championships and NBA Finals and digital marketing and Strong category retail presentation online and at NIKE owned and retail partner stores Revenues also improved for each of our Other Businesses Converse NIKE Golf and Hurley Our gross margins improved largely due to the positive impact of higher average selling prices partially offset by higher product input costs primarily labor cost inflation and foreign currency headwinds For fiscal 2013 the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a yearoveryear decrease in our effective tax rate In addition diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2 decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases during fiscal 2013 On May 31 2012 we announced our intention to divest of the Cole Haan and Umbro businesses which would allow us to better focus our resources on driving growth in the NIKE Jordan Converse and Hurley brands During the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of certain assets of the Umbro brand and recorded a loss on the sale of these assets of 107 million net of tax During the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of Cole Haan and recorded a gain on sale of 231 million net of tax As of May 31 2013 the Company had substantially completed all transition services related to the sale of both businesses Unless otherwise indicated the following disclosures reflect the Companys continuing operations refer to our Discontinued Operations section

adjustments that are not allocated at the category level 19 Table of Contents Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 On a currency neutral basis revenues from our NIKE Inc continuing operations grew 11 for fiscal 2013 driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses Every NIKE Brand geography except Greater China delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2013 North America contributed 7 percentage points of the increase in NIKE Inc revenues while Emerging Markets contributed 2 percentage points and Western and Central and Eastern Europe each contributed 1 percentage point Greater China s results reduced NIKE Inc revenue growth by 1 percentage point Revenues for our Other Businesses contributed 1 percentage point to our consolidated revenue growth Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 11 and 10 respectively while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 20 during fiscal 2013 The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2013 was attributable to growth across our Running Basketball Football Soccer and Sportswear categories The growth of NIKE footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products including Running models with NIKE FREE and Lunar technologies NIKE and Brand Jordan Basketball styles and performance Football soccer products In fiscal 2013 unit sales of footwear increased approximately 7 and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 4 driven equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products For NIKE Brand apparel the increase in revenue for fiscal 2013 was driven by our Men s Training category which includes the NFL licensed business in addition to strong demand for Running and Basketball products Apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 increased approximately 7 and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 3 reflecting a favorable mix of higher priced products such as performance Running Basketball and NFL licensed apparel and to a lesser extent higher selling prices While wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall NIKE Brand revenues we continue to expand Direct to Consumer revenues Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations include NIKE owned inline and factory stores as well as online sales through NIKE owned websites For fiscal 2013 Direct to Consumer revenues represented approximately 19 of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 17 in fiscal 2012 On a currency neutral basis Direct to Consumer revenues grew 24 for fiscal 2013 as comparable store sales grew 14 and we continue to expand our store network and ecommerce business Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE owned inline and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met 1 the store has been open at least one year 2 square footage has not changed by more than 15 within the past year and 3 the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year Revenues for our Other Businesses are comprised of results from Converse Hurley and NIKE Golf Excluding the impact of currency changes revenues for these businesses increased 9 in fiscal 2013 reflecting growth across all businesses Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 On a currency neutral basis revenues for NIKE Incs continuing operations grew 15 for fiscal 2012 driven by increases in revenues for both the NIKE Brand and our Other Businesses Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates revenues for the NIKE Brand increased 15 as every NIKE Brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2012 North America contributed approximately 7 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue increase while the Emerging Markets and Greater China geographies contributed approximately 4 and 2 percentage points to the NIKE Brand revenue growth respectively Revenues for our Other Businesses grew 12 during fiscal 2012 contributing 1 percentage point of our consolidated revenue growth Excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 15 and 13 respectively while NIKE Brand equipment revenues increased 16 during fiscal 2012 Continuing to fuel the growth of our NIKE Brand footwear business was the increased demand for performance products including the NIKE Lunar and FREE technologies The increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was attributable to doubledigit percentage growth in unit sales along with a lowsingledigit percentage increase in average selling price per pair primarily reflecting the favorable impact from product price increases partially offset by higher discounts on closeout sales The overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories notably Running Sportswear and Basketball For NIKE Brand apparel the increase in revenue for fiscal 2012 was driven by midsingledigit percentage increases in both unit sales and average selling prices The increase in average selling prices was primarily driven by product price increases partially offset by a higher mix of closeout sales The overall increase in apparel sales was reflective of increased demand across most key categories For fiscal 2012 Direct to Consumer channels represented approximately 17 of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 16 in fiscal 2011 On a currency neutral basis Direct to Consumer revenues grew 21 for fiscal 2012 as comparable store sales grew 13 and we continue to expand our store network and ecommerce business Revenues for our Other Businesses consisted of results from our affiliate brands Converse Hurley and NIKE Golf Excluding the impact of currency changes revenues for these businesses increased by 12 in fiscal 2012 reflecting growth across all businesses except Hurley which was down slightly for the fiscal year Futures Orders Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2013 were 8 higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period The US Dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period Excluding the impact of currency changes futures orders also increased 8 as unit orders contributed approximately 5 percentage points of growth and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth 20 Table of Contents By geography futures orders growth was as follows Reported Futures Orders Growth Futures Orders Excluding Currency Changes 1 North America 12 12 Western Europe 2 0 Central Eastern Europe 14 12 Greater China 3 0 Japan 17 6 Emerging Markets 12 12 Total NIKE Brand Futures Orders 8 8 1 Growth rates have been restated using constant exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations The reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period This is due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above In addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues Moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of NIKE Brand footwear and apparel sales of NIKE Brand equipment sales from our Direct to Consumer operations and sales from our Other Businesses Gross Margin Dollars in millions Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs FY12 Change Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs FY11 Change Gross Profit

driven by higher net average selling prices approximately 160 basis points that were attributable to higher prices and a favorable sales mix The positive benefit of higher net average selling prices was largely offset by higher product costs approximately 110 basis points primarily due to higher factory labor costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements approximately 40 basis points In addition we have seen significant shifts in the mix of revenues from higher to lower margin segments of our business While growth in these lower gross margin segments delivers incremental revenue and profits it has a negative effect on our consolidated gross margin Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012 our consolidated gross margin was 220 basis points lower than the prior year period primarily driven by higher product input costs including materials and labor across most businesses Also contributing to the decrease in gross margin were higher customs duty charges discounts on closeout sales and an increase in investments in our digital business and infrastructure Together these factors decreased consolidated gross margin by approximately 390 basis points Partially offsetting this decrease were positive impacts from product price increases lower air freight costs the growth of our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer business and benefits from our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives Selling and Administrative Expense Dollars in millions Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 FY13 vs FY12 Change Fiscal 2011 FY12 vs FY11 Change Demand creation expense 1 2745

and promotion expenses including costs of endorsement contracts Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Demand creation expense increased 5 compared to the prior year mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense marketing support for key product initiatives including the NIKE Fuelband and NFL launch as well as an increased level of marketing spending around global sporting events such as the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates demand creation expense increased 8 21 Table of Contents Compared to the prior year operating overhead expense increased 13 primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations higher personnel costs and corporate initiatives to support the growth of our overall business Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the growth in operating overhead expense was 15 Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Overall selling and administrative expense grew at a slower rate than revenues for fiscal 2012 Demand creation expense increased 11 compared to the prior year mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense marketing support for key product initiatives including the NIKE Fuelband and NFL launch as well as an increased level of brand event spending in advance of the European Football Championships and London Summer Olympics For fiscal 2012 changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of demand creation expense by 1 percentage point Compared to the prior year operating overhead expense increased 11 primarily attributable to increased investments in our Direct to Consumer operations higher personnel costs as well as travel expenses to support the growth of our overall business For fiscal 2012 changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of operating overhead expense by 1 percentage point Other Income Expense net In millions Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Other income expense net 15 54 25 Other income expense net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonoperating transactions that are outside the normal course of business Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 For fiscal 2013 other income net increased 69 million compared to the prior year This change was primarily driven by a 48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses in the current year as well as the recognition of a 24 million restructuring charge for NIKE Brand s Western Europe operations in the prior year These positive impacts were partially offset by smaller net gains from nonoperating items We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes of 56 million for fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012 other expense net increased 79 million compared to the prior year This change was primarily driven by a 77 million change in foreign currency net gains in the prior year to net losses in the current year These impacts together with a 24 million charge recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for the restructuring of NIKE Brand s Western Europe operations were partially offset by certain net gains related to nonoperating items We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense net did not have a significant impact on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2012 Income Taxes Fiscal 2013 Fiscal

fiscal year was primarily driven by the US legislative retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and a reduction of tax reserves on foreign operations partially offset by an increase in the percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 90 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 primarily due to changes in estimates of uncertain tax positions This impact was partially offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate on operations outside of the United States as a result of changes in geographical mix of foreign earnings Discontinued Operations The Company continually evaluates its existing portfolio of businesses to ensure resources are invested in those businesses that are accretive to the NIKE Brand and represent the largest growth potential and highest returns On May 31 2012 the Company announced its intention to divest of Umbro and Cole Haan allowing it to focus its resources on driving growth in the NIKE Jordan Converse and Hurley brands 22 Table of Contents On February 1 2013 the Company completed the sale of Cole Haan to Apax Partners for an agreed upon purchase price of 570 million and received at closing 561 million net of 9 million of purchase price adjustments The transaction resulted in a gain on sale of 231 million net of 137 million in tax expense this gain is included in the net income loss from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income Beginning November 30 2012 we classified the Cole Haan disposal group as heldforsale and presented the results of Cole Haans operations in the net income loss from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income From this date until the sale the assets and liabilities of Cole Haan were recorded as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets of NIKE Inc Previously these amounts were reported in our segment presentation as Other Businesses Under the sale agreement we agreed to provide certain transition services to Cole Haan for an expected period of 3 to 9 months from the date of sale We will also license NIKE proprietary Air and Lunar technologies to Cole Haan for a transition period The continuing cash flows related to these items are not expected to be significant to Cole Haan and we will have no significant continuing involvement with Cole Haan beyond the transition services Additionally preexisting guarantees of certain Cole Haan lease payments remain in place after the sale the maximum exposure under the guarantees is 44 million at May 31 2013 The fair value of these guarantees is not material On November 30 2012 we completed the sale of certain assets of Umbro to Iconix Brand Group Iconix for 225 million The results of Umbros operations and Umbros financial position are presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income and balance sheets respectively Previously these amounts were reported in our segment presentation as Other Businesses Upon meeting the heldforsale criteria we recorded a loss of 107 million net of tax on the sale of Umbro The loss on sale was calculated as the net sales price less the Umbro assets of 248 million including intangibles goodwill and fixed assets other miscellaneous charges of 22 million and the release of the associated cumulative translation adjustment of 129 million offset by a 67 million tax benefit on the loss Under the sale agreement we provided transition services to Iconix while certain markets were transitioned to Iconixdesignated licensees These transition services are substantially complete and we have wound down the remaining operations of Umbro For the year ended May 31 2013 net income loss from discontinued operations included for both businesses the net gain or loss on sale net operating losses tax expenses and approximately 20 million in wind down costs Operating Segments The Companys reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design

Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the United States in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into US Dollars Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE Inc We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options As described below the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company NTC and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes 30 Table of Contents on the underlying net exposures being hedged Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes Transactional exposures We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are Product Costs NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways 1 Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity a Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC b Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from thirdparty factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar In both purchasing scenarios a weaker US Dollar reduces the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger US Dollar increases its cost 2 Factory input costs In January 2012 NIKE implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures Under this program our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a thirdparty All currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other income expense net Refer to Note 17 Risk Management and Derivatives for additional detail As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating US Dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening US Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKEs US Dollar inventory cost Conversely a weakening US Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost NonFunctional Currency Denominated External Sales A portion of our Western Europe and Central Eastern Europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro eg British Pound but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency These sales generate a foreign currency exposure Other Costs Nonfunctional currency denominated costs such as endorsement contracts intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent NonFunctional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in other income expense net within our consolidated results of operations Managing transactional exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above Generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging Accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other income expense net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end Translational exposures Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the US Dollar Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into US Dollars for consolidated reporting The translation of foreign subsidiaries nonUS Dollar denominated balance sheets into US Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to OCI within shareholders equity In the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker US Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger US Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit detriment of approximately 605 million and 268 million for the years ended May 31 2013 and 2012 respectively The impact of foreign exchange rate 31 Table of Contents fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit detriment of approximately 104 million and 74 million for the years ended May 31 2013 and 2012 respectively Managing translational exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into US Dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these US Dollar denominated securities at nonUS Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging We utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these US Dollar investments The combination of the purchase and sale of the US Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold Hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements and Note 17 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net had an unfavorable impact of approximately 56 million on our income before income taxes for the year ended May 31 2013 and had an insignificant impact for the year ended May 31 2012 Net investments in foreign subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the US Dollar which could adversely impact the US Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings We have hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income Any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense net The impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented To minimize credit risk we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration Upon maturity the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in OCI There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2013 and 2012 Cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled 22 million for the year ended May 31 2012 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was 30 billion for fiscal 2013 compared to 19 billion for fiscal 2012 Our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2013 was net income of 25 billion Our fiscal 2013 change in working capital was a net cash outflow of 42 million which is exclusive of working capital amounts sold as part of the divestitures of Umbro and Cole Haan as compared to a net cash outflow of 799 million for fiscal 2012 Our investments in working capital decreased due to slowing growth in inventory and reductions in accounts receivable compared to the prior year During fiscal 2013 inventory for continuing operations increased 7 compared to a 23 increase for fiscal 2012 the slowing growth was driven by our continued focus on increasing inventory productivity The reduction in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the collection of receivables related to discontinued operations Cash used by investing activities was 1067 million during fiscal 2013 compared to a 514 million source of cash for fiscal 2012 A major driver of the change was the swing from net salesmaturities of shortterm investments in fiscal 2012 to net purchases of shortterm investments in fiscal 2013 reflective of the additional purchases of shortterm investments made with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in April 2013 In fiscal 2012 there were 1124 million of net salesmaturities of shortterm investments net of purchases while in fiscal 2013 we made 1203 million in net purchases of shortterm investments net of salesmaturities This impact was partially offset by 786 million in proceeds from the sale of Umbro and Cole Haan in fiscal 2013 Cash used by financing activities was 1040 million for fiscal 2013 compared to 2118 million for fiscal 2012 The decrease in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to 986 million in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in April 2013 Also contributing to the decrease were lower payments of longterm debt and notes payable and lower repurchases of common stock which were partially offset by a reduction in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options In fiscal 2013 we purchased 335 million shares of NIKEs class B common stock for 17 billion an average price of 4950 During the year we completed the fouryear 5 billion share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in September 2008 Under that program we purchased a total of 1188 million shares at an average price of 4208 Subsequently we began repurchases under a fouryear 8 billion program approved by the Board in September 2012 As of the end of fiscal 2013 we had repurchased 153 million shares at a cost of 789 million under this current program We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions Capital Resources On April 23 2013 we filed a shelf registration statement the Shelf with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities The Shelf expires on April 23 2017 On April 23 2013 we issued 10 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043 The 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 225 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on May 1 2023 The 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 3625 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on May 1 2043 Interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year The issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of 998 million We will use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes which may include but are not 32 Table of Contents limited to discharging or refinancing debt working capital capital expenditures share repurchases as yet unplanned acquisitions of assets or businesses and investments in subsidiaries On November 1 2011 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to 15 billion with lender approval The facility matures November 1 2016 with a oneyear extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date provided that extensions shall not extend beyond November 1 2018 As of and for the year ended May 31 2013 we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility We currently have longterm debt ratings of A and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively If our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase Conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease Changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility Under this committed revolving credit facility we have agreed to various covenants These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable As of May 31 2013 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future Liquidity is also provided by our 1 billion commercial paper program During the year ended May 31 2013 we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of 505 million As of May 31 2013 there were no outstanding borrowings under this program We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2014 depending on general corporate needs We currently have shortterm debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively As of May 31 2013 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 60 billion of which 35 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries Cash equivalents and shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks money market funds Tier1 commercial paper corporate notes US Treasury obligations US government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities Our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk While individual securities have varying durations as of May 31 2013 the average duration of our shortterm investments and cash equivalents portfolio is 98 days Despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs Future volatility in the capital markets however may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets We believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which US taxes have previously been provided We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings Should we require additional capital in the US we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the US through debt If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds we would be required to accrue and pay additional US taxes less applicable foreign tax credits If we elect to raise capital in the US through debt we would incur additional interest expense OffBalance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor Currently we have several such agreements in place However based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations Contractual Obligations Our significant longterm contractual obligations as of May 31 2013 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows Description of Commitment Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31 In millions 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter Total Operating Leases 403 340 304 272

18 549 TOTAL 5010 1293 1108 892 594 2918 11815 1 The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements andor royalties on product sales in future periods Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods In addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number 33 Table of Contents of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives In addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 2 We generally order product at least 4 to 5 months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms In some cases prices are subject to change throughout the production process The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31 2013 3 Other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms including open purchase orders for nonproduct purchases The reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of May 31 2013 The total liability for uncertain tax positions was 447 million excluding related interest and penalties at May 31 2013 We are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the longterm liability for uncertain tax positions will occur We also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of May 31 2013 Refer to Note 7 ShortTerm Borrowings and Credit Lines for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below In millions Outstanding as of May 31 2013 Notes payable due at mutually agreedupon dates within one year of issuance or on demand 121 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port 55 As of May 31 2013 letters of credit of 149 million were outstanding which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Companys performance under certain selfinsurance and other programs Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In July 2012 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary This accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning June 1 2013 and early adoption is permitted We early adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations In September 2011 the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is morelikelythannot that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards This new guidance was effective for us beginning June 1 2012 The adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations In June 2011 the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity Companies are now required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements This requirement was effective for us beginning June 1 2012 As this guidance only amended the presentation of the components of comprehensive income the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations Further this guidance required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented This requirement will be effective for us beginning June 1 2013 As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2011 the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements This new guidance is effective for us beginning June 1 2013 As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities We believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies Certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date However since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the 34 Table of Contents sixmonth period following the financial statement date Thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters Within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale In some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks In certain countries outside of the US precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available In these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location On the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically As part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date We base our estimates on historical rates of product returns discounts and claims specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates If actual or expected future returns discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments In determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value This reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts In general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract However certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship We record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year These amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period In these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products We expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur In certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments For contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period Property Plant and Equipment and DefiniteLived Assets Property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life Changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value We review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant 35 Table of Contents adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value Goodwill and IndefiniteLived Intangible Assets We perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors We may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test is unnecessary The twostep impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis In step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value if any We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business and working capital effects The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit Indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets we utilize the relieffromroyalty method This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital Fair Value Measurements For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date In general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments including US Treasury securities In the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds US agency securities and money market funds Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio A majority of our availableforsale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing Observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded These controls include an analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income In most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions By their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in fair values of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other income expense net during the quarter in which such changes occur We have used and may in the future use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries The change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity to the extent effective to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments As the value of our underlying net 36 Table of Contents investments in whollyowned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk Accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness We consider on a quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment Should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which changes occur Stockbased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation on the date of grant using the BlackScholes option pricing model The BlackScholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary Realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain At least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made In addition we have not recorded US income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the US thus reducing our overall income tax expense The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our US and foreign entities Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation Despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated For instance the actual cash needs of our US entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore Conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which US income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore In this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination On an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate pretax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate tax expense The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur As the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year When this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs On a quarterly basis we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other income expense net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions We have and may in the future also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements The timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions Generally hedged transactions are expected to be recognized within 12 to 18 months When intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration Hedged transactions are principally denominated in Euros British Pounds and Japanese Yen See section Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices under Item 7 for additional detail Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs To achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed rate debt Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and ValueatRisk VaR Our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only The VaR determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variancecovariance technique These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period The value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors The estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the VaR model was 34 million and 21 million at May 31 2013 and 2012 respectively The VaR increased yearoveryear as a result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio combined with a longer average duration on our outstanding trades at May 31 2013 Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 49 million and 87 million during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 respectively The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation Furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the VaR calculation above Therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows Details of thirdparty debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates Weighted

accessories Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NIKE Inc and its subsidiaries the Company All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated The Company completed the sale of Cole Haan during the third quarter ended February 28 2013 and completed the sale of Umbro during the second quarter ended November 30 2012 As a result the Company reports the operating results of Cole Haan and Umbro in the net income loss from discontinued operations line in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented In addition

the close of business December 10 2012 Common stock began trading at the splitadjusted price on December 26 2012 All share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split Recognition of Revenues Wholesale revenues are recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale Provisions for postinvoice sales discounts returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale Postinvoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date Estimates of discretionary discounts returns and claims are based on historical rates specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and estimated discounts returns and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers As of May 31 2013 and 2012 the Companys reserve balances for postinvoice sales discounts returns and miscellaneous claims were 531 million and 455 million respectively Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs as well as warehousing costs including the cost of warehouse labor third party royalties certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and research design and development costs Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales Operating Overhead Expense Operating overhead expense consists primarily of payroll and benefit related costs rent depreciation and amortization professional services and meetings and travel Demand Creation Expense Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs including costs of endorsement contracts television digital and print advertising brand events and retail brand presentation Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run Advertising placement costs are expensed in the month the advertising appears while costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is completed and delivered A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts Accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions Generally endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts Prepayments made under contracts are included in prepaid expenses or other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies Some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship The Company records selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year These amounts are recorded in selling and administrative expense when the Company determines that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period In these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be recorded in a future period Some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products The Company expenses these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur In certain contracts the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments For contractual obligations for which the Company estimates it will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 48 Table of Contents Through cooperative advertising programs the Company reimburses retail customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products The Company records these costs in selling and administrative expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs which is when the related revenues are recognized This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run Total advertising and promotion expenses were 2745 million 2607 million and 2344 million for the years ended May 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets totaled 386 million and 281 million at May 31 2013 and 2012 respectively Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents represent cash and shortterm highly liquid investments including commercial paper US treasury US agency and corporate debt securities with maturities of three months or less at date of purchase ShortTerm Investments Shortterm investments consist of highly liquid investments including commercial paper US treasury US agency and corporate debt securities with maturities over three months from the date of purchase Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost At May 31 2013 and 2012 the Company did not hold any shortterm investments that were classified as trading or heldtomaturity At May 31 2013 and 2012 shortterm investments consisted of availableforsale securities Availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of tax in other comprehensive income unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification The Company considers all availableforsale securities including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within shortterm investments on the consolidated balance sheets Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys shortterm investments Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts receivable from customers The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments In determining the amount of the allowance the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered noncurrent and recorded in other assets The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was 104 million and 91 million at May 31 2013 and 2012 respectively of which 54 million and 45 million respectively was classified as longterm and recorded in other assets Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued primarily on an average cost basis Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from our suppliers as well as freight import duties taxes insurance and logistics and other handling fees Property Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property plant and equipment are recorded at cost Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is determined on a straightline basis for buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing warehousing and product distribution are recorded in cost of sales Depreciation and amortization of other assets are recorded in selling and administrative expense Software Development Costs Internal Use Software Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 10 year period on a straightline basis The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software In addition the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities training maintenance and all other postimplementation stage activities are expensed as incurred Computer Software to be Sold Leased or Otherwise Marketed Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers In most instances the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established Therefore costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred Impairment of LongLived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds 49 Table of Contents the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test is unnecessary The twostep impairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis In step two of the analysis the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value if any The Company generally bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that the Company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future The Companys significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include its weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business and working capital effects The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business Significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit Indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the C ompany determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets the Company utilizes the relieffromroyalty method This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital Operating Leases The Company leases retail store space certain distribution and warehouse facilities office space and other nonreal estate assets under operating leases Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses rent holidays or certain landlord incentives including tenant improvement allowances Rent expense for noncancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term beginning with the effective lease commencement date which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property Certain leases also provide for contingent rents which are determined as a percentage of sales in excess of specified levels A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives and availableforsale securities Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date The Company uses a threelevel hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques market approach income approach and cost approach The levels of hierarchy are described below Level 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active Level 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement Pricing vendors are utilized for certain Level 1 and Level 2 investments These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing Observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks The Companys fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded These controls include an analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for additional information 50 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into US Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement the impact of which is recorded in other income expense net within the consolidated statements of income Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity debt or net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and if designated the extent to which the hedge is effective The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges this is within the cash provided by operations component of the consolidated statements of cash flows For designated net investment hedges this is generally within the cash provided or used by investing activities component of the cash flow statement As our fair value hedges are receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps the cash flows associated with these derivative instruments are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding These cash flows are reflected within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement Refer to Note 17 Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives StockBased Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE Inc 1990 Stock Incentive Plan the 1990 Plan and employees purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans ESPPs using the BlackScholes option pricing model The Company recognizes this fair value net of estimated forfeitures as selling and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting period using the straightline method Refer to Note 11 Common Stock and StockBased Compensation for more information on the Companys stock programs Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of nonUS subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed nonUS earnings to invest indefinitely in its nonUS operations The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes for further discussion Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards Refer to Note 12 Earnings Per Share for further discussion Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ from these estimates Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In July 2012 the FASB issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary This accounting standard update will be effective for the Company beginning June 1 2013 and early adoption is permitted The Company early adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations In September 2011 the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment This guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is morelikelythannot that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards This new guidance was effective for the Company beginning June 1 2012 and the adoption did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations In June 2011 the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income This new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity Companies are now required to present the components 51 Table of Contents of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements This requirement was effective for the Company beginning June 1 2012 As this guidance only amended the presentation of the components of comprehensive income the adoption did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations Further this guidance required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented This requirement will be effective for the Company beginning June 1 2013 As this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income the Company does not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2011 the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entitys right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments This new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements This new guidance is effective for the Company beginning June 1 2013 As this guidance only requires expanded disclosures the Company does not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations NOTE 2 Inventories Inventory balances of 3434 million and 3222 million at May 31 2013 and 2012 respectively were substantially all finished goods NOTE 3 Property Plant and Equipment

effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31 2013 was 30 basis points lower than the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31 2012 primarily due to tax benefits received from the intercompany sale of intellectual property rights outside of the US the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development credit and the intraperiod allocation of tax expense between continuing operations discontinued operations and other comprehensive income The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate on operations as a result of an increase in earnings in higher tax jurisdictions The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31 2012 was 90 basis points higher than the effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended May 31 2011 primarily due to the changes in uncertain tax positions partially offset by a reduction in the effective rate related

foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States At May 31 2013 the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately 67 billion If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings would be approximately 22 billion at May 31 2013 A portion of the Companys foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday which will phase out in 2019 This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if

global market risks including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31 2013 are designated as cash flow or fair value hedges All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date The total notional amount of outstanding derivatives as of May 31 2013 was approximately 9 billion which primarily comprises cash flow hedges for EuroUS Dollar British PoundEuro and Japanese YenUS Dollar

Income and the consolidated statements of shareholders equity for additional information on changes in other comprehensive income for the years ended May 31 2013 2012 and 2011 Cash Flow Hedges The purpose of the Companys foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from transactions in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates Foreign currency exposures that the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues selling and administrative expenses investments in US Dollardenominated availableforsale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions Product cost exposures are primarily generated through nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways 1 Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC 2 Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar In January 2012 the Company implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures Under this program the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges For all currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order and their accounting treatment is described further below The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed Hedged transactions are denominated primarily in Euros British Pounds and Japanese Yen The Company may enter into hedge contracts typically starting up to 12 to 18 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges for up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges excluding any ineffective portion are recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction In most cases amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be released to net income some time after the maturity of the related derivative Effective hedge results are classified within the consolidated statements of income in the same manner as the underlying exposure with the results of hedges of nonfunctional currency denominated revenues and product cost exposures excluding embedded derivatives as described below recorded in revenues or cost of sales when the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated net income Results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded Results of hedges of anticipated purchases and sales of US Dollardenominated availableforsale securities are recorded in other income expense net when the securities are sold Results of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in other income expense net when the transaction occurs The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items generally within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement Premiums paid on options are initially recorded as deferred charges The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options fair value to other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective The Company formally assesses both at a hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on forward rates Ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended May 31 2013 2012 and 2011 The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when 1 it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions 2 the derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised 3 it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur or 4 management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 64 Table of Contents When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period but is expected to occur within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to net income when the forecasted transaction affects consolidated net income However if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter the gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in other income expense net In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet recognizing future changes in the fair value in other income expense net For the years ended May 31 2013 2012 and 2011 the amounts recorded in other income expense net as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring were immaterial As of May 31 2013 132 million of deferred net gains net of tax on both outstanding and matured derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in net income Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature As of May 31 2013 the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions is 24 months Fair Value Hedges The Company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates Derivatives currently used by the Company to hedge this risk are receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps As of May 31 2013 all interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related longterm debt and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging Accordingly changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying longterm debt The cash flows associated with the Companys fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding which are reflected within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31 2013 2012 or 2011 Net Investment Hedges The Company has hedged and may in the future hedge the risk of variability in foreigncurrencydenominated net investments in whollyowned international operations All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges except ineffective portions are reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the cash provided or used by investing component of the cash flow statement The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its net investment hedges for the years ended May 31 2013 2012 or 2011 Embedded Derivatives As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the US Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the balance sheet with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in other income expense net from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through the date the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations At May 31 2013 the notional amount of embedded derivatives was approximately 136 million Undesignated Derivative Instruments The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet andor the embedded derivative contracts explained above These forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging Accordingly these undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the balance sheet with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in other income expense net together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from undesignated instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items generally within the cash provided by operations component of the cash flow statement Credit Risk The Company is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings However this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted To manage this risk the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored The Companys derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business The Companys bilateral credit related contingent features generally require the owing entity either the Company or the derivative counterparty to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of 50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than 50 million Additionally a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements As of May 31 2013 the Company was in compliance with all credit risk related contingent features and the fair value of its derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was insignificant Accordingly the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features Further as of May 31 2013 those counterparties which were required to post collateral complied with such requirements Given the considerations described above the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial 65 Table of Contents NOTE 18 Operating Segments and Related Information Operating Segments The Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Companys internal organization The major segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity excluding NIKE Golf Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel and equipment The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are North America Western Europe Central Eastern Europe Greater China Japan and Emerging Markets The Companys NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment The Companys Other category is broken into two components for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company The Global Brand Divisions category primarily represents NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment demand creation and operating overhead expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand and costs associated with product development and supply chain operations The Other Businesses category consists of the activities of Converse Inc Hurley International LLC and NIKE Golf Activities represented in the Other category are considered immaterial for individual disclosure Corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses including expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to the Companys headquarters unallocated insurance and benefit programs including stockbased compensation certain foreign currency gains and losses including certain hedge gains and losses certain corporate eliminations and other items The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes commonly referred to as EBIT which represents net income before interest income expense net and income taxes in the consolidated statements of income Reconciling items for EBIT represent corporate expense items that are not allocated to the operating segments for management reporting As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses These rates are set approximately nine months in advance of the future selling season based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established Inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and certain Other Businesses reflect use of these standard rates to record nonfunctional currency product purchases in the entitys functional currency Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses Accounts receivable inventories and property plant and equipment for
