our products to retail accounts through NIKEowned retail stores internet websites and mobile applications which we refer to collectively as our Direct to Consumer or DTC operations and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad Products We focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in nine key categories Running NIKE Basketball the Jordan Brand Football Soccer Mens Training Womens Training Action Sports Sportswear our sportsinspired lifestyle products and Golf Mens Training includes our baseball and American football product offerings We also market products designed for kids as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as cricket lacrosse tennis volleyball wrestling walking and outdoor activities NIKEs athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes We place considerable emphasis on innovation and highquality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products Sportswear Running and the Jordan Brand are currently our topselling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales We also sell sports apparel covering the abovementioned categories which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear Our sports apparel similar to our athletic footwear products is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and highquality construction Sportswear Mens Training and Running are currently our topselling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales We often market footwear apparel

geographic and segment operations appears in Note 17 Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year Historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters However the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic operating and logisticsrelated factors Because NIKE is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products We must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability This is a continuing risk Refer to Item 1A Risk Factors We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization Each NIKE Brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services For fiscal 2017 our reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are North America Western Europe Central Eastern Europe Greater China Japan and Emerging Markets In June 2017 we announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally at scale As a result of this organizational

Our NIKE Brand Direct to Consumer operations are and will continue to be managed within each geographic operating segment Converse is and will continue to be a reportable segment and operates in one industry the design marketing licensing and selling of casual sneakers apparel and accessories Converse Direct to Consumer operations including digital commerce are reported within the Converse operating segment results United States Market For fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 46 of total revenues compared to 47 and 46 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively We sell our NIKE Brand Jordan Brand Hurley and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States including a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts In the United States we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales During fiscal 2017 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 23 of sales in the United States Our Direct to Consumer operations sell NIKE Brand Jordan Brand Hurley and Converse products to consumers through our digital commerce website wwwnikecom and through mobile applications In addition our Direct to Consumer operations sell through the following number of retail stores in the United States US Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores 209 NIKE Brand inline stores including employeeonly stores 34 Converse stores including factory stores 112 Hurley stores including factory and employee stores 29 TOTAL 384 In the United States NIKE has six significant distribution centers located in Memphis Tennessee two of which are owned and four of which are leased NIKE Brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our leased Foothill Ranch California distribution center Converse and Hurley products are shipped primarily from leased facilities in Ontario California as well as from Memphis Tennessee Smaller leased distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States We also operate a futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price For fiscal 2017 orders under the futures program represented 83 of our US wholesale footwear revenues compared to 84 for fiscal 2016 and 87 for fiscal 2015 For fiscal 2017 futures orders represented 66 of our US wholesale apparel revenues compared to 66 for fiscal 2016 and 67 for fiscal 2015 International Markets For fiscal 2017 nonUS NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for 54 of total revenues compared to 53 and 54 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively We sell our products to retail accounts through our own Direct to Consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives around the world We sell to thousands of retail accounts and ship products from 60 distribution centers outside of the United States In many countries and regions including Canada Asia Europe and some Latin American countries we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the United States futures ordering program described above During fiscal 2017 NIKEs three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 12 of total nonUS sales 2 Table of Contents In addition to NIKE and Converse owned digital commerce websites in over 45 countries our Direct to Consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outside the United States NonUS Retail Stores Number NIKE Brand factory stores 642 NIKE Brand inline stores including employeeonly stores 71 Converse stores including factory stores 45 TOTAL 758 International branch offices and subsidiaries of NIKE are located in Argentina Australia Austria Belgium Bermuda Brazil Canada Chile China Croatia the Czech Republic Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Hong Kong Hungary India Indonesia Ireland Israel Italy Japan Korea Macau Malaysia Mexico the Netherlands New Zealand Norway Panama the Philippines Poland Portugal Russia Singapore Slovakia Slovenia South Africa Spain Sri Lanka Sweden Switzerland Taiwan Thailand Turkey the United Arab Emirates the United Kingdom Uruguay and Vietnam Significant Customer No customer accounted for 10 or more of our worldwide net revenues during fiscal 2017 Orders Futures orders for NIKE Brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November 2017 were 147 billion compared to 150 billion for the same period last year NIKE Brand futures orders include 1 orders from external wholesale customers and 2 internal orders from our DTC inline stores and digital commerce operations which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers The US Dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the actual currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period and have become less correlated due to our evolving business model This is due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above In addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues A portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including sales with short lead times closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel all sales of NIKE Brand equipment the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our DTC inline stores and digital commerce operations and sales from Converse NIKE Golf and Hurley Product Research Design and Development We believe our research design and development efforts are key factors in our success Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world Employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process As we continue to develop new technologies we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories Using market intelligence and research our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences The proliferation of NIKE Air Lunar Zoom Free Flywire DriFit Flyknit Flyweave ZoomX React and NIKE technologies throughout our Running NIKE Basketball the Jordan Brand Football Soccer Mens Training Womens Training and Sportswear categories among others typifies our dedication to designing innovative products Manufacturing We are supplied by approximately 127 footwear factories located in 15 countries The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 8 of total fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand footwear production Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories For fiscal 2017 contract factories in Vietnam China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 46 27 and 21 of total NIKE Brand footwear respectively We also have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in Argentina India Brazil Mexico and Italy to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries For fiscal 2017 five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 69 of NIKE Brand footwear production We are supplied by approximately 363 apparel factories located in 37 countries The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 13 of total fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand apparel production Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories For fiscal 2017 contract factories in China Vietnam and Thailand produced approximately 26 16 and 10 of total NIKE Brand apparel respectively For fiscal 2017 one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10 of apparel production and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 43 of NIKE Brand apparel production 3 Table of Contents The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather nylon polyester and canvas as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE AirSole cushioning components During fiscal 2017 Air Manufacturing Innovation with facilities near Beaverton Oregon and in St Charles Missouri as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam were our suppliers of the AirSole cushioning components used in footwear The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads both virgin and recycled specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat and repel rain andor snow and plastic and metal hardware NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place NIKEs independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products Since 1972 Sojitz Corporation of America Sojitz America a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed significant importexport financing services for us During fiscal 2017 Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina Brazil Canada India South Africa Thailand and Uruguay excluding products produced and sold in the same country Approximately 6 of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability However we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates Our current agreements with Sojitz America expire on May 31 2018 and contain a provision allowing us to extend the agreements to May 31 2019 International Operations and Trade Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism We have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future In recent years uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws Notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for NIKE as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment Current US policy proposals including potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods if enacted may negatively affect US corporations with production activities outside the US including NIKE There have also been discussions and commentary regarding potential changes to US trade policies If any of these reforms are implemented it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations In addition with respect to trade restrictions targeting China which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers Chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community Where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact However we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability NIKE advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements Competition The athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas ASICS Li Ning lululemon athletica Puma Under Armour and VF Corporation among others The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world Important aspects of competition in this industry are Product attributes such as quality performance and reliability new product innovation and development and consumer pricevalue Consumer connection and affinity for brands and products developed through marketing and promotion social media interaction customer support and service identification with prominent and influential athletes public figures coaches teams colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics Effective sourcing and distribution of products with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail both instore and online We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 4 Table of Contents Trademarks and Patents We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position We pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against thirdparty theft and infringement We utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying our brands and the Company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others We consider our NIKE and Swoosh trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide In addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements For certain trade dress we have sought and obtained trademark registrations We have copyright protection in our design graphics and other original works In some instances we also obtain registered copyrights We own patents and have a patent license facilitating our use of Air technologies We file for own and maintain many US and foreign utility patents as well as many US and foreign design patents protecting components technologies manufacturing techniques features and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel athletic equipment and digital devices These patents expire at various times We believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design research and development production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positions However we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the United States and select foreign countries on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable We also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against thirdparty infringement Employees As of May 31 2017 we had approximately 74400 employees worldwide including retail and parttime employees Management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent None of our employees are represented by a union except for certain employees in the Emerging Markets geography where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union Also in some countries outside of the United States local laws require employee representation by works councils which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions or by organizations similar to a union In certain European countries we are required by local law to enter into andor comply with industrywide or national collective bargaining agreements NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of

local general economic and market conditions the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear apparel and equipment markets intense competition among designers marketers distributors and sellers

reference in this report and other reports The risks included here are not exhaustive Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance Moreover NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKEs business or the extent to which any risk or combination of risks may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements Given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information Accordingly shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report Furthermore NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others Thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE Our products face intense competition NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products The athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products Our DTC operations both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores also compete with multibrand retailers selling our products Product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service digital commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition This in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations In addition the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers are shopping and the rising trend of digital commerce constitutes a risk factor implicating our DTC and wholesale operations If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation Maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity In addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or by us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations In addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns Negative posts or comments about us on social networking applications or websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image If we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 7 Table of Contents If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits Our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner However lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition In addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media mobile applications and online advertising If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations We rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products Research and development play a key role in technical innovation We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cuttingedge performance products While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems Failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business We establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues as well as other public figures to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers However as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes sports teams and leagues or other public figures or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the high visibility or onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments As a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed Furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected In addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues or other endorsers associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or endorsers could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition In addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes or public figures to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability Currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States As a result we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally Additionally there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdoms impending exit from the European Union commonly referred to as Brexit and current US policy proposals Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into US Dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the US Dollar adversely affects the US Dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger US Dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker US Dollar or other trading currency Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the US Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 8 Table of Contents Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products reduced orders from retailers for our products order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts increased inventories and lower gross margins In the future we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so We conduct transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US Dollar Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies including in response to certain policies advocated by the US presidential administration could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain such as cotton or petroleum derivatives could have a material adverse effect on our costs gross margins and profitability If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products this could result in reduced orders for our products order cancellations late retailer payments extended payment terms higher accounts receivable reduced cash flows greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty some may become insolvent and cease business operations which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs it may result in delays or nondelivery of shipments of our products Our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year Historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters However the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events such as the Olympics or the European Football Championship among others In addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice As a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales Accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period This seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period Futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues We utilize a futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price Our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery We currently report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports Reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for any future period and the relationship between reported futures and reported revenues in a given period has become less correlated over time based on our evolving business model Differences are also due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above In addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues Moreover a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including sales with short lead times closeout NIKE Brand footwear and apparel all sales of NIKE Brand equipment the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our Direct to Consumer inline stores and digital commerce operations and sales from Converse NIKE Golf and Hurley Our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins reduced cash flows and harm to our business We purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows Conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows from period to period A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 9 Table of Contents We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition generally without requiring collateral To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty In the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts retailers may be more cautious with orders A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition In addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products The athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores These retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional retail it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid In addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues Our Direct to Consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties Our Direct to Consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities Because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores Due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our Direct to Consumer operations a decline in sales a shift in consumer behavior away from brickandmortar retail or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs Many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the Companys control pose risks and uncertainties Risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation In addition extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business If the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally could be materially adversely affected Many of our customers shop with us through our digital commerce website and mobile applications Increasingly customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience Any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable userfriendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business We periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others We also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights Defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights Such actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective For example confidential information that is related to business strategy new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions 10 Table of Contents In addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the United States and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected We are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands We currently license and expect to continue licensing certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations customer relationships labor relationships supplier relationships or credit risks it could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees The misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we collect transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate largescale and complex automated attacks Any breach of our network or vendor systems may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data misappropriation of our consumers users or employees personal information or a disruption of our business Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business including unwanted media attention impairment of our consumer and customer relationships damage to our reputation and result in lost sales and consumers fines or lawsuits We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against respond to andor redress problems caused by any breach In addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data Compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety Notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States Accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products This includes for example the uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union as well as the current proposals affecting trade policy in the US The US presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage US corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions including through potential tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the US If any of these reforms are implemented it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations The administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain US multinational corporations in public statements which if directed at us could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business In addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad These factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected In addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 11 Table of Contents We could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws or additional tax liabilities We are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions Current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction including the United States subject to significant change There have been proposals to reform US and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how US multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time These tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate our effective income tax rate would increase in the future We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service IRS and other tax authorities We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made For example we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates Proposed changes to US tax law or policy tariff and importexport regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations During and following the recent US presidential election there has been discussion and commentary regarding potential significant changes to US trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs including NAFTA and trade policies and tariffs affecting China There have also been discussions of a disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products It is unknown at this time whether and to what extent new legislation will be passed into law pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted international trade agreements will be negotiated or the effect that any such action would have either positively or negatively on our industry or on us The Company similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by these changes If any new legislation andor regulations are implemented or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes Such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses As part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions In addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad As a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products NIKE is supplied by approximately 127 footwear factories located in 15 countries We do not own or operate any of our own footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell In fiscal 2017 five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2017 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69 of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2017 Our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations Additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing The principal materials used in our apparel products natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place The principal materials used in our footwear products natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather natural and synthetic fabrics and threads nylon canvas and polyurethane films are also locally available to manufacturers Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured 12 Table of Contents There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all Further our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products In addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner If we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements In addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards Any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm Because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance In addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins Current US trade policy proposals including potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect our results of operations In addition Sojitz America performs significant importexport financing services for the Company During fiscal 2017 Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina Uruguay Brazil Canada India South Africa and Thailand collectively the Sojitz Markets excluding products produced and sold in the same country Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the Sojitz Markets Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability Our success depends on our global distribution facilities We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world Our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business We maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the Internet and thirdparty services Information Technology Systems across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown For example our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems Over a number of years we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate Our work to integrate secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts The failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers malware natural disasters vendor business interruptions or other causes or failure to properly maintain protect repair or upgrade systems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition We also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans or those of our vendors do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage Furthermore we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing digital commerce consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues damage to our reputation and loss of users 13 Table of Contents The market for prime real estate is competitive Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases In addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition Additionally the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers customers distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition Moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and tsunamis whether occurring in the United States or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns From time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our digital commerce operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention We believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability However significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations We are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations As a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world we are involved in various types of claims lawsuits regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business our products and the actions of our employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation The global nature of our business means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time which could adversely affect us In addition any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees We depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel The loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock As of June 30 2017 Swoosh LLC beneficially owned more than 78 of our Class A Common Stock If on June 30 2017 all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16 The shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the US securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh LLC The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock Swoosh LLC was formed by Philip H Knight our Chairman Emeritus to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock On June 30 2016 Mr Knight sold his voting interest in Swoosh LLC to a trust controlled by his son and NIKE director Travis Knight Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options Our longterm debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard Poors and Moodys Investors Service If our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to the unsecured credit market could be limited We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to among other things incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments pledge assets as security make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default and as a result the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated In addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt 14 Table of Contents If our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets hedge accounting for derivatives stockbased compensation income taxes and other contingencies Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock Antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock There are provisions of our articles of incorporation and Oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect threequarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number However such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company We may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts estimates of our future performance Analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline In the past securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities If our stock price is volatile for any reason we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future Any litigation could result in reputational damage substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business 15 Table of Contents ITEM 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None ITEM 2 Properties The following is a summary of principal properties owned or

Table of Contents ITEM 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations NIKE designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world We sell our products to retail accounts through NIKEowned inline and factory retail stores and NIKEowned internet websites and mobile applications which we refer to collectively as our Direct to Consumer or DTC operations and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses Our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative must have products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail online and through mobile applications In June 2017 we announced the Consumer Direct Offense a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally at scale Leveraging the power of digital NIKE will drive growth by accelerating innovation and product creation moving even closer to the consumer through key cities and deepening onetoone connections In addition to achieving longterm sustainable revenue growth we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas Expanding gross margin by Delivering innovative premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced pricetovalue equation for consumers Reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency product design and innovation Making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation help reduce waste and have longterm potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market and Driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC business led by digital commerce as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our DTC and wholesale operations Optimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on Investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit Infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and Investments in key areas of future growth including our DTC business Managing working capital efficiency and Deploying capital effectively Through execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals through fiscal 2020 on average per year are as follows High singledigit to low doubledigit revenue growth Midteens earnings per share growth Hightwenties to lowthirties percentage rate of return on invested capital Free cash flow growing faster than net income and Sustainable profitable longterm growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses Over the past ten years we have achieved many of our financial goals During this time revenues and diluted earnings per common share for NIKE Inc inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations have grown 8 and 13 respectively on an annual compounded basis We expanded gross margin by approximately 70 basis points and our return on invested capital has increased from 219 to 347 On November 19 2015 we announced a two forone split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 23 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9 2015 Common stock began trading at the splitadjusted price on December 24 2015 All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split Our fiscal 2017 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE Inc portfolio to deliver continued growth and expanding profitability Despite foreign currency headwinds we achieved record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2017 NIKE Inc Revenues grew 6 to 344 billion Net income increased 13 and diluted earnings per common share grew 16 to 251 We also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for longterm growth Earnings before interest and income taxes EBIT increased 7 for fiscal 2017 driven by revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage partially offset by gross margin contraction The increase in revenues was driven by growth across all NIKE Brand geographies and Converse footwear and apparel and several key categories This broadbased growth was primarily fueled by Innovative performance and sportswear products incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as NIKE Air Free Zoom Lunar Flywire DriFit and Flyknit Deep brand connections with consumers through our category offense reinforced by investments in endorsements by highprofile athletes sports teams and leagues highimpact marketing around global sporting events and digital marketing and Strong category retail presentation through digital commerce and NIKEowned and retail partner stores NIKE Inc gross margin decreased 160 basis points primarily due to higher product costs and foreign currency exchange rate headwinds which more than offset higher fullprice average selling price ASP At current rates we anticipate foreign currency exchange rate headwinds will continue to negatively impact gross margin and Net income in fiscal 2018 21 Table of Contents Converse revenues increased 4 and EBIT declined 2 as growth in direct distribution markets and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by lower gross margin primarily a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs as well as the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues primarily due to market transitions For fiscal 2017 the growth in Net income was positively affected by a yearoveryear decrease in our effective tax rate of 550 basis points primarily due to a onetime benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the US Internal Revenue Service IRS of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States Diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than Net income due to a 3 decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchase program While foreign currency markets remain volatile we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above Use of NonGAAP Financial Measures Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10K we discuss nonGAAP financial measures including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currencyneutral revenues which should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no Direct to Consumer operations NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of 1 sales to external wholesale customers and 2 internal sales from our wholesale operations to our Direct to Consumer operations which are charged at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers Additionally currencyneutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations Management uses these nonGAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company s performance including when making financial and operating decisions Additionally management believes these nonGAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends However references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currencyneutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP and may not

sales The increase in constantcurrency footwear revenue for fiscal 2017 was attributable to growth in most key categories most notably Sportswear and Running Unit sales of footwear increased 7 Higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 10 percentage points of footwear revenue growth primarily attributable to higher fullprice ASP in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories Currencyneutral growth in apparel revenue was fueled by increases in most key categories led by Sportswear and Running For fiscal 2017 unit sales of apparel were flat while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 8 percentage points of apparel revenue growth The increase in ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher fullprice ASP in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories Reported EBIT decreased 9 in part reflecting the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the Argentine Peso and Mexican Peso Reported revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by lower gross margin Gross margin decreased 430 basis points as higher fullprice ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs primarily resulting from ongoing investments in our growing DTC business partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies Demand creation expense also increased as lower advertising costs were more than offset by increased marketing support for the Rio Olympics in the first quarter as well as higher sports marketing costs Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 On a currencyneutral basis fiscal 2016 revenues for Emerging Markets increased 13 Growth was attributable to higher revenues in 7 of 9 territories led by one of our largest territories SOCO which includes Argentina Uruguay and Chile which grew 32 and by Mexico and Pacific which includes Australia and New Zealand which grew 31 and 27 respectively Revenues declined 5 in Brazil primarily reflecting ongoing macroeconomic challenges On a category basis revenues grew in nearly every key

in footwear revenue for fiscal 2016 was driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category most notably Sportswear and Running For fiscal 2016 unit sales of footwear increased 1 while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 13 percentage points of footwear revenue growth Higher ASP was attributable to higher fullprice ASP primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higherpriced DTC business The constantcurrency growth in apparel revenue was due to increases in most key categories led by Sportswear Running and Womens Training Fiscal 2016 unit sales of apparel decreased 2 while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 13 percentage points of apparel revenue growth Higher ASP was due to higher fullprice ASP primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of an increase in the

and Korean Won as gross margin expansion more than offset lower reported revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues Gross margin expanded 350 basis points due to higher fullprice ASP lower warehousing and obsolescence costs and growth in our highermargin DTC business partially offset by shifts in mix to highercost products and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates Selling and administrative expense declined on a reported basis but was higher as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead due to additional investments in our DTC

businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes increased 3 for fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher demand creation expense which was only partially offset by a decline in operating overhead expense The increase in demand creation expense was due to higher marketing and advertising expenses for key brand and sporting events including the Rio Olympics and the European Football Championship in the first quarter Operating overhead expense decreased as higher wagerelated expenses were more than offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Global Brand Divisions loss before interest and taxes increased 15 for fiscal 2016 due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense and to a lesser extent lower revenues largely resulting from the expiration of certain football club endorsement agreements Operating

directly to distributors and wholesale customers and to consumers through DTC operations The largest direct distribution markets are the United States the United Kingdom and China We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by thirdparty licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 On a currencyneutral basis revenues for Converse increased 6 for fiscal

percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2017 Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 2 while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth On a territory basis the increase in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the United States partially offset by lower revenues in Europe Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total Converse revenues by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2017 primarily driven by the market transition in Italy Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 5 having an insignificant impact to total Converse revenue The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues is primarily due to lower revenues in Latin America Reported EBIT declined 2 for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by gross margin contraction Gross margin decreased 300 basis points as higher fullprice ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin products Gross margin also contracted due to the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues primarily due to market transitions Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense primarily as a result of lower retail brand presentation costs partially offset by higher advertising expense Operating overhead increased as higher

for fiscal 2016 Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 15 for fiscal 2016 reducing total Converse revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point The decrease in comparable licensed

more than offset selling and administrative expense leverage Gross margin declined 220 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates shifts in mix to highercost products and higher offprice mix more than offset higher fullprice ASP Selling and administrative expense declined faster than reported revenues primarily due to lower demand creation which more than offset

724 1173 38 1097 7 Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program The Corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses including expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters unallocated insurance benefit and compensation programs including stockbased compensation and certain foreign currency gains and losses In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse related foreign currency hedge results conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments 34 Table of Contents Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 For fiscal 2017 Corporates loss before interest and taxes decreased 449 million primarily due to the following a beneficial change of 280 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse net of hedge gains and losses these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin a beneficial change of 115 million primarily driven by lower variable compensation and administrative costs in operating overhead expense and an increase in net foreign currency gains of 54 million related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments reported as a component of consolidated Other income expense net Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 For fiscal 2016 Corporates loss before interest and taxes increased 76 million primarily due to the following an increase of 179 million primarily driven by higher operating overhead expense to support corporate growth initiatives a beneficial change of 76 million from net foreign currency losses to net foreign currency gains related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse net of hedge gains these gains are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin and a beneficial change of 27 million in net foreign currency gains related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments reported as a component of consolidated Other income expense net Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices Overview As a global company with significant operations outside the United States in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into US Dollars Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to NIKE Inc We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options As described below the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company NTC and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes Transactional Exposures We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are Product Costs NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways 1 Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity a Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from thirdparty factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC b Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from thirdparty factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar In both purchasing scenarios a weaker US Dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger US Dollar increases its cost 35 Table of Contents 2 Factory input costs NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures Under this program our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a thirdparty All currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other income expense net Refer to Note 16 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating US Dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthe ning US Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKEs US Dollar inventory cost Conversely a weakening US Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost NonFunctional Currency Denominated External Sales A portion of our Western Europe and Central Eastern Europe geography revenues as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues are earned in currencies other than the Euro eg the British Pound but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency These sales generate a foreign currency exposure Other Costs Nonfunctional currency denominated costs such as endorsement contracts also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent In certain cases the Company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to foreign currencies and create embedded derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value through Other income expense net Refer to Note 16 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail NonFunctional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables including intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other income expense net within our consolidated results of operations Managing Transactional Exposures Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above Generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with US GAAP except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments under US GAAP Accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other income expense net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end Translational Exposures Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the US Dollar Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into US Dollars for consolidated reporting The translation of foreign subsidiaries nonUS Dollar denominated balance sheets into US Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income a weaker US Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger US Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately 542 million and 1985 million for the years ended May 31 2017 and 2016 respectively The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately 115 million and 449 million for the years ended May 31 2017 and 2016 respectively Managing Translational Exposures To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into US Dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these US Dollar denominated securities at nonUS Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging We utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these US Dollar investments The combination of the purchase and sale of the US Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold Hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 36 Table of Contents Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other income expense net had an unfavorable impact of approximately 59 million and 423 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31 2017 and 2016 respectively Net Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the US Dollar which could adversely impact the US Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings We have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments These hedges are accounted for in accordance with US GAAP There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2017 and 2016 There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31 2017 and 2016 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Activity Cash provided by operations was 3640 million for fiscal 2017 compared to 3096 million for fiscal 2016 Net income adjusted for noncash items generated 4781 million of operating cash flow in fiscal 2017 compared to 4676 million for fiscal 2016 Our fiscal 2017 change in working capital was a cash outflow of 1141 million compared to an outflow of 1580 million for fiscal 2016 The change in working capital was primarily due to the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging activities For fiscal 2017 cash collateral received from counterparties which is recorded in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets decreased 105 million compared to a decrease of 863 million during fiscal 2016 Refer to the Credit Risk section of Note 16 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail This decrease in cash collateral was partially offset by a 486 million increase in Accounts Receivable net driven by higher revenues Cash used by investing activities was 1008 million for fiscal 2017 compared to 1034 million for fiscal 2016 driven primarily by the net change in shortterm investments and reverse repurchase agreements as well as additions of property plant and equipment During fiscal 2017 the net change in investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash inflow of 118 million compared to an outflow of 57 million in fiscal 2016 This change was partially offset by the maturity of reverse repurchase agreements of 150 million in fiscal 2016 which did not recur in fiscal 2017 Additions of property plant and equipment were 1105 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 1143 million in fiscal 2016 In fiscal 2018 we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth including corporate facilities new DTC stores and expanding our digital capabilities We continue to expect such investments will be approximately 4 of revenues on average Cash used by financing activities was 1942 million for fiscal 2017 compared to 2671 million for fiscal 2016 The decrease in Cash used by financing activities was primarily driven by increased proceeds from the issuance of debt and commercial paper in fiscal 2017 partially offset by higher dividends and lower excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements In fiscal 2017 we purchased 597 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for 3249 million an average price of 5443 per share under the fouryear 12 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015 As of May 31 2017 we had repurchased 798 million shares at a cost of approximately 4437 million an average price of 5563 per share under this program We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows excess cash andor proceeds from debt The timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions Capital Resources On October 21 2016 we issued 15 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2026 and 2046 The 2026 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 10 billion at a 2375 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on November 1 2026 The 2046 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 3375 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on November 1 2046 Interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year The issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of 1493 million Refer to Note 8 LongTerm Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on Longterm debt On August 28 2015 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings The facility matures August 28 2020 with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28 2022 As of and for the periods ended May 31 2017 and 2016 we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility We currently have longterm debt ratings of AA and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively If our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase Conversely if our longterm debt ratings were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease Changes in our longterm debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility Under this committed revolving credit facility we have agreed to various covenants These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable As of May 31 2017 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 37 Table of Contents Liquidity is also provided by our 2 billion commercial paper program During the year ended May 31 2017 the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was 919 million As of May 31 2017 there were 325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2018 depending on general corporate needs We currently have shortterm debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively As of May 31 2017 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 62 billion of which 58 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries Cash equivalents and Shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks money market funds commercial paper corporate notes US Treasury obligations US government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities Our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk While individual securities have varying durations as of May 31 2017 the average duration of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 65 days To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs Future volatility in the capital markets however may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets We believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed We routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which US taxes have previously been provided We also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings Should we require additional capital in the United States we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds we would be required to accrue and pay additional US taxes less applicable foreign tax credits If we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt we would incur additional interest expense OffBalance Sheet Arrangements In connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor Currently we have several such agreements in place However based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations Contractual Obligations Our significant longterm contractual obligations as of May 31 2017 and significant endorsement contracts including related marketing commitments entered into through the date of this report are as follows

arrangements 2 The cash payments due for longterm debt include estimated interest payments Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31 2017 if variable timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations 3 The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete public figure sport team and league endorsers of our products Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements andor royalties on product sales in future periods Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods In addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives In addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 4 We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our DTC inline stores and digital commerce operations The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms In some cases prices are subject to change throughout the production process 5 Other purchase obligations primarily include construction service and marketing commitments including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts made in the ordinary course of business The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms including open purchase orders for nonproduct purchases 38 Table of Contents In addition to the above we have longterm obligations for uncertain tax positions and various postretirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes and Note 13 Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and postretirement benefits respectively We also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of May 31 2017 Refer to Note 7 ShortTerm Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below Outstanding as of May 31 2017 In millions Notes payable due at mutually agreedupon dates within one year of issuance or on demand 325 Payable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port 51 As of May 31 2017 the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling 152 million These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Companys performance under certain selfinsurance and other programs New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards Critical Accounting Policies Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements We believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date However since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date Thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies Within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported Revenue Recognition We record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer In some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks In certain countries outside of the United States precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available In these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location On the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically As part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date We base our estimates on 1 historical rates of product returns discounts and claims 2 specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates If actual or expected future returns discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable We make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments In determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required In the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made 39 Table of Contents Inventory Reserves We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions If we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to Cost of sales Contingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts A significant portion of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts In general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract However certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year When we determine payments are probable the amounts are recorded in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance In these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance increased or decreased Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur In certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term Property Plant and Equipment and DefiniteLived Assets We review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value Hedge Accounting for Derivatives We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Other comprehensive income rather than Net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income In most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions By their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other income expense net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs Stockbased Compensation We account for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation on the date of grant using the BlackScholes option pricing model The BlackScholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period Income Taxes We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary Realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain At least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made In addition we have not recorded US income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States thus reducing our overall Income tax expense The amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our US and foreign entities Income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 40 Table of Contents We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation Despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated For instance the actual cash needs of our US entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations This would result in additional Income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore Conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which US income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore In this case our Income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination On an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate Income tax expense The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur As the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year When this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs On a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense Other Contingencies In the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions We have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements The timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31 2017 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for EuroUS Dollar British PoundEuro and Japanese YenUS Dollar currency pairs Refer to Note 16 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs To achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities Market Risk Measurement We monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and ValueatRisk VaR Our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only The VaR determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variancecovariance technique These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period The value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors The estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the VaR model was 97 million and 109 million at May 31 2017 and 2016 respectively The VAR decreased yearoveryear as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31 2017 Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 161 million and 209 million during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 respectively The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation Furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the VaR calculation above Therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows Details of thirdparty debt are provided in the table below The table presents

provisions of the contracts Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship The Company records demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year When the Company determines payments are probable the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Companys best estimate of the endorsers performance In these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from the Companys estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance increased or decreased demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products The Company expenses these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur In certain contracts the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments For contracts for which the Company estimates it will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract period 52 Table of Contents Through cooperative advertising programs the Company reimburses customers for

Operating Overhead Expense Operating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefitrelated expenses as well as other administrative costs such as rent depreciation and amortization professional services and meetings and travel Cash and Equivalents Cash and equivalents represent cash and shortterm highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates including commercial paper US Treasury US Agency money market funds time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase ShortTerm Investments Shortterm investments consist of highly liquid investments including commercial paper US Treasury US Agency time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase Debt securities that the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost At May 31 2017 and 2016 the Company did not hold any shortterm investments that were classified as trading or heldtomaturity At May 31 2017 and 2016 Shortterm investments consisted of availableforsale securities Availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of tax in Accumulated other comprehensive income unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification The Company considers all availableforsale securities including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within Shortterm investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys shortterm investments Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable net consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments In determining the amount of the allowance the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered noncurrent and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was 19 million and 43 million at May 31 2017 and 2016 respectively Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on either an average or specific identification cost basis For inventories in transit that represent direct shipments to customers the related inventory and cost of sales are recognized on a specific identification basis Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Companys suppliers as well as inbound freight import duties taxes insurance and logistics and other handling fees Property Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Property plant and equipment are recorded at cost Depreciation is determined on a straightline basis for land improvements buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense Software Development Costs Internal Use Software Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 12 year period on a straightline basis The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software In addition the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities training maintenance and all other postimplementation stage activities are expensed as incurred Computer Software to be Sold Leased or Otherwise Marketed Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers In most instances the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established Therefore software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred 53 Table of Contents Impairment of LongLived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value Goodwill and IndefiniteLived Intangible Assets The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test is unnecessary The twostep impairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis In step two of the analysis the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value if any Indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the C ompany determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets the Company utilizes the relieffromroyalty method This method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital Operating Leases The Company leases retail store space certain distribution and warehouse facilities office space and other nonreal estate assets under operating leases Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses renewal options rent holidays or certain landlord incentives including tenant improvement allowances Rent expense for noncancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term beginning with the effective lease commencement date which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property Certain leases also provide for contingent rent which is generally determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable Fair Value Measurements The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives and availableforsale securities Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date The Company uses a threelevel hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques market approach income approach and cost approach The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active Level 3 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing Observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates forward pricing curves currency volatilities currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and that of its counterparties 54 Table of Contents Level 1 investments include US Treasury securities Assets and liabilities included within Level 2 include commercial paper US Agency securities money market funds time deposits corporate debt securities and derivative contracts Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs and are an immaterial portion of our portfolio The Companys fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for additional information Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into US Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Total shareholders equity The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement the impact of which is recorded in Other income expense net within the Consolidated Statements of Income Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income a component of Total shareholders equity Longterm debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and if designated the extent to which the hedge is effective The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For designated net investment hedges this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For the Companys fair value hedges which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Refer to Note 16 Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives StockBased Compensation The Company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE Inc Stock Incentive Plan and employees purchase rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans ESPPs using the BlackScholes option pricing model The Company recognizes this fair value net of estimated forfeitures as Operating overhead expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period using the straightline method Refer to Note 11 Common Stock and StockBased Compensation for more information on the Companys stockbased compensation programs Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized United States income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of nonUS subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated The Company determines annually the amount of undistributed nonUS earnings to invest indefinitely in its nonUS operations The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes for further discussion Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards Refer to Note 12 Earnings Per Share for further discussion Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ from these estimates 55 Table of Contents Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In April 2015 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No 201503 Interest Imputation of Interest Subtopic

purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways 1 Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company NTC a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies When the NTC sells to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency the result is a foreign currency exposure for the NTC 2 Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to the Companys existing foreign currency exposures Under this program the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges For all currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was 111 billion as of May 31 2017 During the second quarter of fiscal 2017 the Company terminated all forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 15 billion in connection with the October 21 2016 debt issuance refer to Note 8 LongTerm Debt Upon termination of these forwardstarting swaps the Company made cash payments to the related counterparties of 92 million which was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive 68 Table of Contents income and will be released through Interest expense income net as interest expense is incurred over the term of the issued debt During the second quarter of fiscal 2016 the Company terminated certain forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 1 billion in connection with the October 29 2015 debt issuance refer to Note 8 LongTerm Debt Upon termination of these forwardstarting swaps the Company received cash payments from the related counterparties of 34 million which was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and will be released through Interest expense income net as interest expense is incurred over the term of the issued debt All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges excluding any ineffective portion are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction In most cases amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be released to Net income in periods following the maturity of the related derivative rather than at maturity Effective hedge results are classified within the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure The results of hedges of nonfunctional currency denominated revenues and product cost exposures excluding embedded derivatives are recorded in Revenues or Cost of sales when the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated Net income Results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income related to forwardstarting interest rate swaps will be released through Interest expense income net as interest expense is incurred over the term of the issued debt Results of hedges of anticipated purchases and sales of US Dollardenominated availableforsale securities are recorded in Other income expense net when the securities are sold Results of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded in Other income expense net when the transaction occurs The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Premiums paid or received on options are initially recorded as deferred charges or deferred credits respectively The Company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options fair value to Accumulated other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective The Company formally assesses both at a hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods Effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on changes in forward rates Ineffectiveness was immaterial for the years ended May 31 2017 2016 and 2015 The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when 1 it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions 2 the derivative expires or is sold terminated or exercised 3 it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur or 4 management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate When the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period but is expected to occur within an additional two month period of time thereafter the gain or loss on the derivative remains in Accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to Net income when the forecasted transaction affects consolidated Net income However if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter the gains and losses that were in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in Other income expense net In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding the Company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets recognizing future changes in the fair value in Other income expense net For the years ended May 31 2017 2016 and 2015 the amounts recorded in Other income expense net as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring were immaterial As of May 31 2017 100 million of deferred net gains net of tax on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature As of May 31 2017 the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months Fair Value Hedges The Company has in the past been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related longterm debt meet the shortcut method requirements under US GAAP Accordingly changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying longterm debt The cash flows associated with the Companys fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding which are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31 2017 2016 or 2015 On October 15 2015 the Company repaid the longterm debt which had previously been hedged with these interest rate swaps Accordingly a s of May 31 2017 the Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges Net Investment Hedges The Company has in the past hedged and may in the future hedge the risk of variability in foreigncurrencydenominated net investments in whollyowned international operations All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges except ineffective portions are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from net investment hedges for the years ended May 31 2017 2016 or 2015 The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2017 69 Table of Contents Undesignated Derivative Instruments The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets andor the embedded derivative contracts These forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under US GAAP Accordingly these undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other income expense net together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from undesignated instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was 105 billion as of May 31 2017 Embedded Derivatives As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the US Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other income expense net from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through the date the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations In addition the Company has entered into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts These payment terms expose NIKE to variability in foreign exchange rates and create embedded derivative contracts that must be bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding changes in fair value recognized in Other income expense net until each payment is settled At May 31 2017 the total notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately 265 million Credit Risk The Company is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings However this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted To manage this risk the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored The Companys derivative contracts contain credit riskrelated contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business The Companys bilateral creditrelated contingent features generally require the owing entity either the Company or the derivative counterparty to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of 50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than 50 million Additionally a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements As of May 31 2017 the Company was in compliance with all credit riskrelated contingent features and had derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features in a net liability position of 59 million However no derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features in a net liability position were greater than 50 million by counterparty Accordingly the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features Further as of May 31 2017 the Company had received no cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements Given the considerations described above the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial NOTE 17 Operating Segments and Related Information The Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Companys internal organization The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel and equipment The Companys reportable operating segments for the

gains and losses 70 Table of Contents The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes commonly referred to as EBIT which represents Net income before Interest expense income net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income As part of the Companys centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Companys geographic operating segments and to Converse These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate specifically for each currency one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record nonfunctional currency product purchases in the entitys functional currency Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Companys centrally managed foreign exchange
