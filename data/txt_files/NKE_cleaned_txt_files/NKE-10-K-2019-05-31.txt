trademarks certain apparel digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities SALES AND MARKETING We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year Historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters However the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic operating and logisticsrelated factors Because NIKE is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products We must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability This is a continuing risk Refer to Item 1A Risk Factors We report our NIKE Brand

We believe our research design and development efforts are key factors in our success Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world Employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process As we continue to develop new technologies we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories Using market intelligence and research our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences The proliferation of NIKE Air Lunar Zoom Free Flywire DriFit Flyknit Flyweave ZoomX React Adaptive and NIKE technologies among others throughout our Running NIKE Basketball Jordan Brand Football Soccer Training and Sportswear categories typifies our dedication to designing innovative products MANUFACTURING We are supplied by 112 footwear factories located in 12 countries The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 9 of total fiscal 2019 NIKE Brand footwear production Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories For fiscal 2019 contract factories in Vietnam China and Indonesia manufactured approximately 49 23 and 21 of total NIKE Brand footwear respectively We also have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in Argentina and India to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries For fiscal 2019 four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 61 of NIKE Brand footwear production We are supplied by 334 apparel factories located in 36 countries The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 14 of total fiscal 2019 NIKE Brand apparel production Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories For fiscal 2019 contract factories in China Vietnam and Thailand produced approximately 27 22 and 10 of total NIKE Brand apparel respectively For fiscal 2019 one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10 of apparel production and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 49 of NIKE Brand apparel production The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather nylon polyester and canvas as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE AirSole cushioning components During fiscal 2019 Air Manufacturing Innovation a whollyowned subsidiary with facilities near Beaverton Oregon and in St Charles Missouri as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam were our suppliers of the AirSole cushioning components used in footwear The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads both virgin and recycled specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat and repel rain andor snow and plastic and metal hardware NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place NIKEs independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products Since 1972 Sojitz Corporation of America Sojitz America a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed importexport financing services for us During fiscal 2019 Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina Brazil Canada India South Africa and Uruguay excluding products produced and sold in the same country Approximately 5 of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability However we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates 4 NIKE INC Table of Contents INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the implementation of or potential changes in foreign and domestic trade policies increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism We have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future In recent years uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws Notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for NIKE as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment NIKE also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements Changes in US trade policies including new and potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods may negatively affect US corporations with production activities outside the US including NIKE There have also been discussions and commentary regarding retaliatory actions by countries affected by the new tariffs and other changes in US trade policy and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain US goods which could negatively affect US corporations with business operations andor consumer markets in those countries Depending on the extent that certain new or proposed reforms are implemented by the US government and the manner in which foreign governments respond to such reforms it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations In addition with respect to proposed trade restrictions targeting China which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers Chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community Where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact However we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA and other antibribery laws applicable to our operations We source a significant portion of our products from and have important consumer markets outside of the United States and we have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us our employees agents suppliers and other partners COMPETITION The athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas Anta ASICS Li Ning lululemon athletica Puma Under Armour and VF Corporation among others The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 2019 FORM 10K 5 Table of Contents NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world Important aspects of competition in

important to our brand our success and our competitive position We pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against thirdparty theft and infringement We use trademarks

jurisdictions worldwide In addition we own many other trademarks that we use in marketing our products We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements For

consultation on certain Company decisions or by organizations similar to a union In certain European countries we are required by local law to enter into andor comply with industrywide or national collective bargaining agreements NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements 6 NIKE INC Table of Contents INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The

referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports The risks included here are not exhaustive Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance Moreover NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKEs business or the extent to which any risk or combination of risks may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements Given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information Accordingly shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report Furthermore NIKE has a policy against confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others Thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE Our products face intense competition NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products The athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products Our NIKE Direct operations both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores also compete with multibrand retailers selling our products 8 NIKE INC Table of Contents Product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service digital commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition This in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations In addition the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers are shopping and the rising trend of digital commerce constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation Maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation In addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives Our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity and brand culture Negative claims or publicity involving us our products consumer data or any of our key employees endorsers sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claims are accurate For example while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we do not control their practices Negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image Social media which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or by us could also damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations If the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity then our sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits Our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner However lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition In addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media mobile applications and online advertising If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations We rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products Research and development play a key role in technical innovation We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cuttingedge performance products While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems Failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business We establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues as well as other public figures including artists designers and influencers to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers However as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional 2019 FORM 10K 9 Table of Contents athletes sports teams and leagues or other public figures or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the high visibility or onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments As a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed Furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected In addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues or other endorsers associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or endorsers could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition In addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes public figures or sports organizations to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability General economic factors beyond our control and changes in the global economic environment including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates Additionally there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdoms impending exit from the European Union commonly referred to as Brexit or new or proposed US policy changes that impact the US Dollar value relative to other international currencies Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into US Dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the US Dollar adversely affects the US Dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger US Dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker US Dollar or other trading currency Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the US Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition Slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products reduced orders from retailers for our products order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts increased inventories and lower gross margins In the future we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so We conduct transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US Dollar Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies including in response to certain policies advocated or implemented by the US presidential administration could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain such as cotton or petroleum derivatives could have a material adverse effect on our costs gross margins and profitability If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products this could result in reduced orders for our products order cancellations late retailer payments extended payment terms higher accounts receivable reduced cash flows greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty some may become insolvent and cease business operations which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers 10 NIKE INC Table of Contents If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs it may result in delays or nondelivery of shipments of our products Our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year Historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters However the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events such as the NBA Finals Olympics or the World Cup among others In addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice As a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales Accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period This seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition generally without requiring collateral To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty In the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts retailers may be more cautious with orders A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition In addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products Failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins reduced cash flows and harm to our business To meet anticipated demand for our products we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows Conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows from period to period A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products The athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores These retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional retail it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid In addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 2019 FORM 10K 11 Table of Contents Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties Our NIKE Direct stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems and personnel We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities Because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores Due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our NIKE Direct operations a decline in sales a shift in consumer behavior away from brickandmortar retail or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs Many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the Companys control pose risks and uncertainties Risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation In addition extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business If the technologybased systems that give our consumers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally could be materially adversely affected Many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms Increasingly consumers are using mobilebased devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience Any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable userfriendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales harm our reputation with consumers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business We periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others We also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe on their intellectual property rights Defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights These actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective For example confidential information related to business strategy new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely inadvertently or improperly used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions In addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the United States and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we handle

applications Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social 12 NIKE INC Table of Contents engineering such as phishing and largescale complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time Any breach of our or our service providers network or other vendor systems may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data misappropriation of our consumers users or employees personal information or a disruption of our business Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business including unwanted media attention impairment of our consumer and customer relationships damage to our reputation resulting in lost sales and consumers fines lawsuits or significant legal and remediation expenses We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against respond to andor redress problems caused by any breach In addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the US Europe and elsewhere For example the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation the GDPR which became effective on May 25 2018 and California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act the CCPA which will go into effect in 2020 These laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored Compliance with existing proposed and recently enacted laws including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under GDPR and CCPA and regulations can be costly any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits We are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands We currently license and expect to continue licensing certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations customer relationships labor relationships supplier relationships or credit risks it could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety Notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition Negative publicity regarding production methods alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers manufacturers or licenses Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States Accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products This includes for example the uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the US and elsewhere as further described below under We could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate and Changes to US trade policy tariff and importexport regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations The US presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage US corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the US which may require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations The administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain US multinational corporations in public statements which if directed at us could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business 2019 FORM 10K 13 Table of Contents In addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad These factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected In addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate We are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in any jurisdiction subject to significant change On December 22 2017 the US enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the Tax Act which includes a number of significant changes to previous US tax laws that impact us including provisions for a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after December 31 2017 among other changes The Tax Act also transitions US international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on nonUS earnings which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to US taxation Implementation of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 We completed our analysis of the Tax Act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions There have been proposals to reform foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how US multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings We also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters These holidays and rulings expire in whole or in part from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met The impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate For example in January 2019 the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company If this matter is adversely resolved the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and the Companys Netherlands income taxes in the future could increase We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service IRS and other tax authorities We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made For example we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates Changes to US trade policy tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations Changes in US or international social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business as well as any negative sentiment toward the US as a result of such changes could adversely affect our business The US presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the US economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the US and other countries where we conduct our business It may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes As a result of recent policy changes of the US presidential administration and recent US government proposals there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade The new tariffs and other changes in US trade policy has in the past and could continue to trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments have instituted 14 NIKE INC Table of Contents or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain US goods The Company similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the US and foreign countries including governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or economic sanctions Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the US economy or certain sectors thereof our industry and the global demand for our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses As part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions In addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad As a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products NIKE is supplied by 112 footwear factories located in 12 countries We do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell In fiscal 2019 four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2019 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 61 of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2019 Our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship including due to changes in applicable trade policies we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations Additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing The principal materials used in our apparel products natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place The principal materials used in our footwear products natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather natural and synthetic fabrics and threads nylon canvas and polyurethane films are also locally available to manufacturers Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all Further our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products In addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner If we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements In addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards Any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 2019 FORM 10K 15 Table of Contents Because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance In addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins Changes in US trade policies including new and potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect our results of operations In addition Sojitz America performs significant importexport financing services for the Company During fiscal 2019 Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina Brazil Canada India South Africa and Uruguay collectively the Sojitz Markets excluding products produced and sold in the same country Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the Sojitz Markets Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability Our success depends on our global distribution facilities We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world Our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business We maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the Internet and thirdparty services Information Technology Systems across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown For example our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems Over a number of years we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate Our work to integrate secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts The failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers malware natural disasters vendor business interruptions or other causes or failure to properly maintain protect repair or upgrade systems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition We also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans or those of our vendors do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage Furthermore we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing digital commerce consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues damage to our reputation and loss of users The market for prime real estate is competitive Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease 16 NIKE INC Table of Contents economics demographics and other factors We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases In addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition Additionally the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers customers distribution centers headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition Moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and tsunamis whether occurring in the United States or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns From time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our digital commerce operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention We believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations We are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations As a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the US and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels If we or our employees agents suppliers and other partners fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations such failure could subject us to fines sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations We are involved in various types of claims lawsuits regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business our products and the actions of our employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability antitrust trademark rights and a variety of other matters It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation The global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks such as antibribery anticorruption fraud trade environmental competition privacy and other regulatory matters will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time which could adversely affect us In addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees The success of our business depends in part on highquality employees including key personnel Our success depends in part on the continued service of highquality employees including key executive officers and personnel The loss of the services of key individuals or any negative perception with respect to these individuals could harm our business Our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel In addition shifts in US immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract hire and retain highly

Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default and as a result the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated In addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt If our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory reserves contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets hedge accounting for derivatives stockbased compensation income taxes and other contingencies Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock Antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock There are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect threequarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number However such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company We may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts opinions of our future performance which may in part be based upon any guidance we have provided Analysts estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline In the past securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities If our stock price is volatile for any reason we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future Any litigation could result in reputational damage substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources needed to successfully run our business 18 NIKE INC Table of Contents ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES The following is a summary of principal properties owned or

AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NIKE designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world We sell our products through NIKEowned retail stores and through digital platforms which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses Our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative musthave products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail Through the Consumer Direct Offense we are focusing on our Triple Double strategy with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation increasing our speed to market and growing our direct connections with consumers As a result of the execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals through fiscal 2023 on average per year are as follows High singledigit revenue growth Gross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points Slight selling and administrative expense leverage Midteens earnings per share growth and Lowthirties percentage rate of return on invested capital Fiscal 2019 was our first full year executing against our new strategy and our results demonstrated the power of the NIKE Inc portfolio to generate revenue growth while investing in capabilities to fuel our next phase of longterm growth and profitability We achieved record revenues in fiscal 2019 growing 7 to 391 billion The NIKE Brand which represents over 90 of NIKE Inc Revenues delivered 8 revenue growth fueled by investments in innovative products and digital platforms On a currencyneutral basis NIKE Brand revenues grew 11 driven by growth across all geographies NIKE Direct and wholesale nearly all key categories and doubledigit growth across footwear and apparel Within our NIKE Direct business digital outpaced all other channels growing at 35 in fiscal 2019 Revenues for Converse increased 1 and 3 on a reported and currencyneutral basis respectively primarily driven by doubledigit growth in Asia and digital which was partially offset by declines in the US and Europe Income before income taxes increased 11 for fiscal 2019 as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense NIKE Inc gross margin increased 90 basis points primarily due to higher fullprice average selling price ASP on a wholesale equivalent basis favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and growth in NIKE Direct These benefits were partially offset by higher product costs Selling and administrative expense was higher as a percent of revenues reflecting investments in data and analytics capabilities digital commerce platforms and an initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate our endtoend digital transformation Additionally we prioritized investments in global brand campaigns aimed at deepening our connection with consumers Diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2 decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchase program While foreign currency markets remain volatile in part due to geopolitical dynamics leading to a stronger US Dollar we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above 24 NIKE INC Table of Contents For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial

filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 25 2018 USE OF NONGAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10K we discuss nonGAAP financial measures including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currencyneutral revenues which should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of 1 sales to external wholesale customers and 2 internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers Additionally currencyneutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations Management uses these nonGAAP financial measures when evaluating the Companys performance including when making financial and operating decisions Additionally management believes these nonGAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends However references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currencyneutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled nonGAAP measures used by other companies 2019 FORM 10K 25 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Dollars in millions except per share data FISCAL 2019 FISCAL

interest and taxes largely consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses including expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to our

losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 For

component of consolidated gross margin an unfavorable change of 210 million primarily due to higher operating overhead expense driven by higher wagerelated and administrative costs and a favorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of 132 million related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments reported as a component of consolidated Other income expense net 2019 FORM 10K 35 Table of Contents FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES OVERVIEW As a global company with significant operations outside the United States in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into US Dollars Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE Inc We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options As described below the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company NTC and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are Product Costs NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways 1 Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity a Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from thirdparty factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC b Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from thirdparty factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar In both purchasing scenarios a weaker US Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger US Dollar increases its cost 2 Factory input costs NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures Under this program our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a thirdparty All currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other income expense net Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating US Dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening US Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKEs US Dollar inventory cost Conversely a weakening US Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 36 NIKE INC Table of Contents NonFunctional Currency Denominated External Sales A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro eg the British Pound but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency These sales generate a foreign currency exposure Other Costs Nonfunctional currency denominated costs such as endorsement contracts also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent In certain cases the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other income expense net Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail NonFunctional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables including intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other income expense net within our consolidated results of operations MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above Generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments Accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other income expense net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the US Dollar Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into US Dollars for consolidated reporting The translation of foreign subsidiaries nonUS Dollar denominated balance sheets into US Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income loss within Shareholders equity In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income a weaker US Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger US Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately 1236 million a benefit of approximately 832 million and a detriment of approximately 542 million for the years ended May 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately 233 million a benefit of approximately 177 million and a detriment of approximately 115 million for the years ended May 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively Management generally identifies hyperinflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a threeyear period exceeds 100 Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyperinflationary market As a result beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the US Dollar As of and for the period ended May 31 2019 this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into US Dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these US Dollar denominated investments at nonUS Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under US GAAP We utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these US Dollar investments The combination of the purchase and sale of the US Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold Hedges of the purchase of US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 2019 FORM 10K 37 Table of Contents We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other income expense net had an unfavorable impact of approximately 97 million 110 million and 59 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the US Dollar which could adversely impact the US Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings We have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with US GAAP There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2019 and 2018 There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31 2019 2018 and 2017 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW ACTIVITY Cash provided by operations was 5903 million for fiscal 2019 compared to 4955 million for fiscal 2018 Net income adjusted for noncash items generated 5341 million of operating cash flow for fiscal 2019 compared to 3473 million for fiscal 2018 The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided by operations of 562 million for fiscal 2019 compared to an increase to Cash provided by operations of 1482 million for fiscal 2018 The primary driver of the change in working capital relates to the accrual of 1172 million for the transition tax under the Tax Act during fiscal 2018 Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes for additional information on the Tax Act Cash provided by operations in fiscal 2019 was further impacted by the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging transactions During fiscal 2019 we received cash collateral of 266 million compared to 23 million in fiscal 2018 In addition the change in Accounts receivable net decreased Cash provided by operations by 457 million in fiscal 2019 primarily driven by revenue growth Cash provided used by investing activities was an outflow of 264 million for fiscal 2019 compared to an inflow of 276 million for fiscal 2018 driven primarily by the net change in shortterm investments During fiscal 2019 the net change in investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash inflow of 850 million compared to an inflow of 1326 million in fiscal 2018 In fiscal 2020 we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth including corporate facilities expanding our digital capabilities and new NIKE Direct stores We continue to expect such investments to approximate 3 to 4 of revenues on average Cash used by financing activities was 5293 million for fiscal 2019 compared to 4835 million for fiscal 2018 with the increase primarily impacted by the repayment of Notes payable during fiscal 2019 In fiscal 2019 we purchased 543 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for 4283 million an average price of 7886 per share During the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we concluded the fouryear 12 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2015 Throughout this program we purchased a total of 1921 million shares for 12 billion an average price of 6247 per share Immediately following the completion of this program we began repurchasing shares under the new fouryear 15 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in June 2018 As of May 31 2019 we had repurchased 116 million shares at a cost of 986 million an average price of 8472 per share under this new program We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows excess cash andor proceeds from debt The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions CAPITAL RESOURCES On July 21 2016 we filed a shelf registration statement the Shelf with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time The Shelf expired on July 21 2019 and we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in July 2019 For additional information regarding our longterm debt refer to Note 8 LongTerm Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 38 NIKE INC

waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable As of May 31 2019 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future Liquidity is also provided by our 2 billion commercial paper program On June 1 2018 we repaid 325 million and had no additional borrowings under this program as of and for the year ended May 31 2019 We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs We currently have shortterm debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively To date in fiscal 2019 we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs however future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets As of May 31 2019 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 47 billion primarily consisting of deposits held at major banks money market funds commercial paper corporate notes US Treasury obligations US government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities Our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk While individual securities have varying durations as of May 31 2019 the weightedaverage days to maturity of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 32 days We believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor Currently we have several such agreements in place Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our significant longterm contractual obligations as of May 31 2019 and significant

fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31 2019 if variable timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations 3 The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete public figure sport team and league endorsers of our products Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements andor royalties on product sales in future periods Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods In addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives In addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 4 We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our NIKE Direct inline stores and digital commerce operations The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms In some cases prices are subject to change throughout the production process 5 Other purchase obligations primarily include construction service and marketing commitments including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts made in the ordinary course of business The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms including open purchase orders for nonproduct purchases 6 Represents the future cash payments due as part of the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which is reflected net of foreign tax credits we utilized Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

cash payments will occur Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes and Note 13 Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and postretirement benefits respectively We also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of May 31 2019 Refer to Note 7 ShortTerm Borrowings and Credit Lines in the

general business obligations NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements We believe the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Finance Committee of the Board of Directors 40 NIKE INC Table of Contents These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements as of a given date Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies Within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported REVENUE RECOGNITION On June 1 2018 we adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU No 201409 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method of adoption Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies Our revenue recognition polices under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs and references to prior period policies under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 605 Revenue Recognition are included below in the event they are substantially different Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear apparel and equipment as well as Converse products comprise a single performance obligation which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer based on the terms of sale A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product Transfer of control passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer Control passes to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment Prior to June 1 2018 the requirements for recognizing revenue were met upon delivery to the customer The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions As part of our revenue recognition policy consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against Revenues with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Prior to June 1 2018 the Companys reserve balances were reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for product returns and recognized within Accounts receivable ne t for wholesale transactions and Accrued liabilities for our direct to consumer business on the Consolidated Balance Sheets The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns Provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date Estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded If actual or expected future returns discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made Refer also to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16 Revenues for additional information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements INVENTORY RESERVES We also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 2019 FORM 10K 41 Table of Contents CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS A significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts In general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract However certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year When we determine payments are probable the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance In these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which we record in Cost of sales as the related sales occur For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITELIVED ASSETS We review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss rather than Net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income In most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions By their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss to Other income expense net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs INCOME TAXES We are subject to taxation in the United States as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws On an interim basis we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate Income tax expense The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur As the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year When this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 42 NIKE INC Table of Contents We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary Realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain At least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made On a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense On December 22 2017 the United States enacted the Tax Act which significantly changed previous US tax laws including provisions for a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after December 31 2017 among other changes The Tax Act also transitions US international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on nonUS earnings which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to US taxation Certain provisions of the Tax Act including a provision to tax global intangible lowtaxed income GILTI of foreign subsidiaries were not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019 In accordance with US GAAP the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense Implementation of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 We completed our analysis of the Tax Act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information OTHER CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 2019 FORM 10K 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions We have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements The timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31 2019 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for EuroUS Dollar British PoundEuro Chinese YuanUS Dollar and Japanese YenUS Dollar currency pairs Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs To achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT We monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and ValueatRisk VaR Our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only The VaR determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variancecovariance technique These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding oneyear period The value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors The estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the VaR model was 34 million and 93 million at May 31 2019 and 2018 respectively The VAR decreased yearoveryear as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31 2019 Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 83 million and 260 million during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 respectively 44 NIKE INC Table of Contents The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation Furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the VaR calculation above Therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows Details of thirdparty debt are provided in the table below The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by

its subsidiaries the Company or NIKE All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated REVENUE RECOGNITION Beginning in fiscal 2019 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU No 201409 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with the Companys historical accounting policies The Companys revenue recognition polices under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs and references to prior period policies under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 605 Revenue Recognition Topic 605 are included below in the event they are substantially different Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear apparel and equipment as well as Converse products comprise a single performance obligation which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer based on the terms of sale A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product Transfer of control passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer Control passes to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment Prior to June 1 2018 the requirements for recognizing revenue were met upon delivery to the customer The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions Consideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through salesbased or usagebased royalty arrangements and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction and are collected by the Company from a customer are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenue is recognized 56 NIKE INC Table of Contents SALESRELATED RESERVES Consideration promised in the Companys contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Prior to June 1 2018 the Companys reserve balances were reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for product returns and recognized within Accounts receivable net for wholesale transactions and Accrued liabilities for the Companys direct to consumer business on the Consolidated Balance Sheets The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns Provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date Estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded If actual or expected future returns discounts or claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves established a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made COST OF SALES Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs as well as warehousing costs including the cost of warehouse labor thirdparty royalties certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs including costs of endorsement contracts complimentary product television digital and print advertising and media costs brand events and retail brand presentation Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run Advertising media costs are expensed when the advertisement appears Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is complete and delivered A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts In general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract However certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport eg winning a championship The Company records Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year When the Company determines payments are probable the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Companys best estimate of the endorsers performance In these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the Companys estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which the Company records in Cost of sales as the related sales occur For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense Through cooperative advertising programs the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products The Company records these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run 2019 FORM 10K 57 Table of Contents Total advertising and promotion expenses which the Company refers to as Demand creation expense were 3753 million 3577 million and 3341 million for the years ended May 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled 773 million and 730 million at May 31 2019 and 2018 respectively of which 333 million and 359 million respectively was recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and 440 million and 371 million respectively was recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applied OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE Operating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefitrelated expenses research and development costs as well as other administrative expenses such as rent depreciation and amortization professional services meetings and travel CASH AND EQUIVALENTS Cash and equivalents represent cash and shortterm highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates including commercial paper US Treasury US Agency money market funds time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase SHORTTERM INVESTMENTS Shortterm investments consist of highly liquid investments including commercial paper US Treasury US Agency time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase Debt securities the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost At May 31 2019 and 2018 the Company did not hold any shortterm investments classified as trading or heldtomaturity At May 31 2019 and 2018 Shortterm investments consisted of availableforsale debt securities which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of tax in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification The Company considers all availableforsale debt securities including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within Shortterm investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys shortterm investments ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable net consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments In determining the amount of the allowance the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered noncurrent and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was 30 million at both May 31 2019 and 2018 INVENTORY VALUATION Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis In some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Companys suppliers as well as inbound freight import duties taxes insurance and logistics and other handling fees PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION Property plant and equipment are recorded at cost Depreciation is determined on a straightline basis for land improvements buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense 58 NIKE INC Table of Contents SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS Internal Use Software Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 12 year period on a straightline basis The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software In addition the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities training maintenance and all other postimplementation stage activities are expensed as incurred Computer Software to be Sold Leased or Otherwise Marketed Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers In most instances the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established Therefore software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred IMPAIRMENT OF LONGLIVED ASSETS The Company reviews the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value GOODWILL AND INDEFINITELIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount an impairment test is unnecessary If an impairment test is necessary the Company will estimate the fair value of its related reporting units If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value Indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the Company determines it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets the Company primarily utilizes the relieffromroyalty method This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital If the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible exceeds its fair value the asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value 2019 FORM 10K 59 Table of Contents OPERATING LEASES The Company leases retail store space certain distribution and warehouse facilities office space equipment and other nonreal estate assets under operating leases Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses renewal options rent holidays or certain landlord incentives including tenant improvement allowances Rent expense for noncancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term beginning with the effective lease commencement date which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property Certain leases also provide for contingent rent which is generally determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives equity securities and availableforsale debt securities Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date The Company uses a threelevel hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques market approach income approach and cost approach The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active Level 3 Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing Observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates forward pricing curves currency volatilities currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties The Companys fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for additional information FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into US Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income loss in Total shareholders equity The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement the impact of which is recorded in Other income expense net within the Consolidated Statements of Income ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of Total shareholders equity Longterm debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and if designated the extent to which the hedge is effective The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the 60 NIKE INC Table of Contents Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For designated net investment hedges this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For the Companys fair value hedges which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives STOCKBASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value net of estimated forfeitures of equity awards and recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense as applicable in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straightline basis over the vesting period Substantially all awards vest ratably over four years of continued employment with stock options expiring ten years from the date of grant The fair value of options stock appreciation rights and employees purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans ESPPs is determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant Refer to Note 11 Common Stock and StockBased Compensation for additional information on the Companys stockbased compensation programs INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes for further discussion EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards Refer to Note 12 Earnings Per Share for further discussion MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ from these estimates RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Topic 606 which replaces existing revenue recognition guidance The new standard requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services In addition Topic 606 requires disclosures of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers The Company adopted this standard using a modified retrospective approach in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized in Retained earnings at June 1 2018 Comparative prior period information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported in accordance with previous revenue recognition guidance in Topic 605 The Company has applied the new standard to all contracts at adoption 2019 FORM 10K 61 Table of Contents The Companys adoption of Topic 606 resulted in a change to the timing of revenue recognition The satisfaction of the Companys performance obligation is based upon transfer of control over a product to a customer which results in sales being recognized upon shipment rather than upon delivery for certain wholesale transactions and substantially all digital commerce sales A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product This resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment which increased Retained earnings by 23 million at June 1 2018 The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2019 Additionally the Companys reserve balances for returns postinvoice sales discounts and miscellaneous claims for wholesale transactions were previously reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for product returns and as a reduction to Accounts receivable net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Under Topic 606 an asset for the estimated cost of inventory for expected products returns is now recognized separately from the liability for salesrelated reserves This resulted in an increase to Accounts receivable net an increase in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and an increase in Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31 2019 Salesrelated reserves for the Companys direct to consumer operations continue to be recognized in Accrued liabilities but are now recorded separately from an asset for the estimated cost of inventory for expected product returns which is recognized in Prepaid expenses and other current assets The following table presents the related effect of the adoption of Topic 606 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31 2019 AS OF MAY 31 2019 Dollars in millions AS REPORTED EFFECT OF ADOPTION BALANCES

Financial Statements were immaterial Refer to Note 16 Revenues for further discussion In February 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 201802 Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income Topic 220 Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss The standard allows for reclassification of stranded tax effects on items resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the Tax Act from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss to Retained earnings Tax effects unrelated to the Tax Act are released from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item The Company early adopted the ASU in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 As a result of the

effectiveness The Company elected to early adopt the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU 201704 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment which simplified the accounting for goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in measuring an impairment charge previously Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test Under the new standard an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value previously Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test The guidance still allows companies to perform the optional qualitative assessment before determining whether to proceed to Step 1 The Company adopted the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements In January 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201601 Financial Instruments Overall Subtopic 82510 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure The Company adopted the ASU in the first

issued ASU No 201602 Leases Topic 842 which replaces existing lease accounting guidance The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record rightofuse ROU assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet ROU assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease The new guidance will require the Company to continue to classify leases as either an operating or finance lease with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement In addition the new standard requires enhanced disclosure surrounding the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing agreements In July 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 201811 which provides entities with an additional transition method to adopt Topic 842 Under the new transition method an entity initially applies the new standard at the adoption date versus at the beginning of the earliest period presented and recognizes a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption The Company will elect this transition method at the adoption date of June 1 2019 Upon adoption the Company will elect the package of transition practical expedients which would allow the Company to carry forward prior conclusions related to i whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases ii the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and iii initial direct costs for existing leases Additionally the Company will elect the practical expedient to not separate lease components from nonlease components for all real estate leases within the portfolio The Company will make an accounting policy election to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will recognize related lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straightline basis over the lease term In preparation for implementation the Company has been executing changes to business processes including implementing a software solution to assist with the new reporting requirements Upon adoption the Companys total assets and total liabilities will increase by approximately 28 billion The Company does not believe

to global market risks including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under US GAAP The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions and assessing both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of the hedging relationships The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31 2019 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for EuroUS Dollar British PoundEuro Chinese YuanUS Dollar and Japanese YenUS Dollar currency pairs All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date The following

derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction Effective hedge results are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be discontinued when it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period The gains and losses associated with discontinued derivative instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be recognized immediately in Other income expense net if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two month period thereafter In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding the Company will account for the derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below The purpose of the Companys foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Companys consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues demand creation expenses investments in US Dollar denominated availableforsale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions 76 NIKE INC Table of Contents Product cost exposures are primarily generated through nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below NIKE entities primarily purchase product in two ways 1 Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company NTC a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC 2 Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to the Companys existing foreign currency exposures Under this program the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges For all currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was 81 billion as of May 31 2019 As of May 31 2019 approximately 518 million of deferred net gains net of tax on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature As of May 31 2019 the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 15 months FAIR VALUE HEDGES The Company has in the past been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related longterm debt meet the shortcut method requirements under US GAAP Accordingly changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying longterm debt The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31 2019 NET INVESTMENT HEDGES The Company has in the past hedged and may in the future hedge the risk of variability in foreign currencydenominated net investments in whollyowned international operations All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2019 UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets andor the embedded derivative contracts These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other income expense net together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position andor embedded derivative contract The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was 65 billion as of May 31 2019 2019 FORM 10K 77 Table of Contents EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the US Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory In addition embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other income expense net through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist At May 31 2019 the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately 452 million CREDIT RISK The Company is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings however this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted To manage this risk the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored The Companys derivative contracts contain credit riskrelated contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business The Companys bilateral creditrelated contingent features generally require the owing entity either the Company or the derivative counterparty to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of 50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than 50 million Additionally a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements As of May 31 2019 the Company was in compliance with all credit riskrelated contingent features and derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features in a net liability position were immaterial Accordingly the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features Further as of May 31 2019 the Company had 289 million of cash collateral received from various counterparties to its derivative contracts refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial NOTE 15 ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS

programs and other general business obligations In connection with various contracts and agreements the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor Currently the Company has several such agreements in place However based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations In the ordinary course of its business the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty the Company does not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations financial position or cash flows 84 NIKE INC Table of Contents ITEM 9 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS
