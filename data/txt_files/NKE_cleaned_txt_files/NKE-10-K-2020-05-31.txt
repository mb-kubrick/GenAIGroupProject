devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities SALES AND MARKETING We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year Historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters However the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic operating and logisticsrelated factors as evidenced by the impact of the COVID19 pandemic Because NIKE is a consumer products company the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities as well as changing design trends affect the demand for our products We must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability This is a continuing risk Refer to Item

manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering digital technologies industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists physicians and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world Employee athletes athletes engaged

the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories and consumer applications Using market intelligence and research our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories to respond to consumer preferences The proliferation of NIKE Air Zoom Free Flywire DriFit Flyknit Flyweave FlyEase

designing innovative products MANUFACTURING We are supplied by 122 footwear factories located in 12 countries Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by over 15 independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 9 of total fiscal 2020 NIKE Brand footwear production For fiscal 2020 contract factories in Vietnam Indonesia and China manufactured approximately 50 24 and 22 of total NIKE Brand footwear respectively We also have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in Argentina and India to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries For fiscal 2020 four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 61 of NIKE Brand footwear production We are supplied by 329 apparel factories located in 38 countries The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 11 of total fiscal 2020 NIKE Brand apparel production Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories For fiscal 2020 contract factories in Vietnam China and Cambodia produced approximately 28 23 and 12 of total NIKE Brand apparel respectively For fiscal 2020 two apparel contract manufacturers accounted for more than 10 of apparel production and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 48 of NIKE Brand apparel production The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather nylon polyester and canvas as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE AirSole cushioning components During fiscal 2020 Air Manufacturing Innovation a whollyowned subsidiary with facilities near Beaverton Oregon in Dong Nai Province Vietnam and St Charles Missouri as well as independent contractors in China and 2020 FORM 10K 3 Table of Contents Vietnam were our suppliers of materials and cushioning components used in footwear Air Manufacturing Innovation also manufactures and sells small amounts of various other plastic products to other manufacturers The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads both virgin and recycled specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat and repel rain andor snow and plastic and metal hardware NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place NIKEs independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products Since 1972 Sojitz Corporation of America Sojitz America a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed importexport financing services for us During fiscal 2020 Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina Brazil Canada India South Africa and Uruguay excluding products produced and sold in the same country Approximately 4 of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability However we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates 2020 FORM 10K 4 Table of Contents INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the implementation of or potential changes in foreign and domestic trade policies increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism We have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future In recent years uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws Notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for NIKE as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment NIKE also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements Changes in US trade policies including new and potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods may negatively affect US corporations with production activities outside the US including NIKE There have also been discussions and commentary regarding retaliatory actions by countries affected by the new tariffs and other changes in US trade policy and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain US goods which could negatively affect US corporations with business operations andor consumer markets in those countries Depending on the extent that certain new or proposed reforms are implemented by the US government and the manner in which foreign governments respond to such reforms it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations In addition with respect to proposed trade restrictions targeting China which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers Chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community Where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact However we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA and other antibribery laws applicable to our operations We source a significant portion of our products from and have important consumer markets outside of the United States and we have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us our employees agents suppliers and other partners COMPETITION The athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas Anta ASICS Li Ning lululemon athletica Puma Under Armour and VF Corporation among others The intense

been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic A n ovel strain of coronavirus COVID19 was first identified in Wuhan China in December 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization To date this pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic have caused and are expected to continue to cause business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the 2020 FORM 10K 8 Table of Contents financial markets both globally and in the United States These events have led to and could continue to lead to a decline in discretionary spending by consumers and in turn materially impact our business sales financial condition and results of operations We have experienced a negative i mpact on our sales operations and financial results and we cannot predict the degree to or the time period over which our sales operations and financial results will continue to be affected by the pandemic and preventative measures Risks presented by the COVID19 pandemic include but are not limited to Deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and globally Reduced consumer demand for our products as consumers seek to reduce or delay discretionary spending in response to the impacts of COVID19 including as a result of a rise in unemployment rates and diminished consumer confidence Cancellation or postponement of sports seasons and sporting events in multiple countries including in the United States and bans on large public gatherings which have reduced consumer spending on our products and could impact the effectiveness of our arrangements with key endorsers Decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures reduced operating hours social distancing restrictions andor changes in consumer behavior The risk that any safety protocols in NIKEowned or affiliated facilities will not be effective or not be perceived as effective or that any virusrelated illnesses will be linked or alleged to be linked to such facilities whether accurate or not Incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures including providing facial coverings and hand sanitizer rearranging operations to follow social distancing protocols conducting temperature checks and undertaking regular and thorough disinfecting of surfaces Disruption to our distribution centers and our thirdparty manufacturing partners and other vendors including through the effects of facility closures reductions in operating hours labor shortages and real time changes in operating procedures including for additional cleaning and disinfection procedures Bankruptcies or other financial difficulties facing our wholesale customers which could cause them to be unable to make or delay making payments to us or result in cancellation or reduction of their orders Operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks as a result of extended workforce remote work arrangements and restrictions on employee travel Impacts to our distribution and logistics providers ability to operate or increases in their operating costs These supply chain effects may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand including digital demand and could result in an increase in our costs of production and distribution including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses and Significant disruption of and volatility in global financial markets which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future We continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operating financial and tax planning projections including assumptions regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and the global macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic However we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operations and financial condition due to the uncertainty of future developments In particular we believe the ultimate impacts on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on among other things the further spread and duration of COVID19 the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of the illness the availability safety and efficacy of a vaccine and treatments for COVID19 and the economic impacts of the pandemic Even in those regions where we are beginning to experience business recovery should those regions fail to fully contain COVID19 or suffer a COVID19 relapse those markets may not recover as quickly or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations The pandemic may also affect our business operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks In addition the impact of COVID19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A Risk Factors any of which could have a material effect on us Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world If global economic and financial market conditions further deteriorate or do not improve the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition Our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers Declines in consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products increased inventories reduced orders from retailers for our products order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts and lower gross margins In the future we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so 2020 FORM 10K 9 Table of Contents We conduct transactions in various currencies which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US Dollar Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain such as cotton or petroleum derivatives could have a material adverse effect on our costs gross margins and profitability If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products this could result in reduced orders for our products order cancellations late retailer payments extended payment terms higher accounts receivable reduced cash flows greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty some may become insolvent and cease business operations which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs it may result in delays or nondelivery of shipments of our products Our products services and experiences face intense competition NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products The athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies private labels and large companies that have diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products Our NIKE Direct operations both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores also compete with multibrand retailers which sell our products through their digital platforms and physical stores and with digital commerce platforms In addition we compete with respect to the digital experiences we are able to offer our consumers Product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service digital commerce platforms digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of intense competition This in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology a reduction in barriers to the creation of new footwear and apparel companies and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel athletic equipment services and experiences constitute significant risk factors in our operations In addition the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers shop and the continued proliferation of digital commerce constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase demand for our products may decline possibly significantly or we may need to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products Failure to maintain our reputation brand image and culture could negatively impact our business Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation Maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation In addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives Our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity purpose and brand culture Negative claims or publicity involving us our culture and values our products services and experiences consumer data or any of our key employees endorsers sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claims are accurate For example while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we do not control their practices Negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand Social media which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or by us could also damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations If the reputation culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity then our sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 2020 FORM 10K 10 Table of Contents Our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year Historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters However the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal or COVID19 related cancellations or postponements and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events such as the NBA Finals Olympics or the World Cup among others In addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice As a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales Accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period This seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions outbreaks of disease social or political unrest availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits Our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner However lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition In addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media mobile applications and online advertising If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations We rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products Research and development play a key role in technical innovation We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering digital technologies industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cuttingedge performance products While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence Failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business We establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues as well as other public figures including artists designers and influencers to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers However as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes sports teams and leagues or other public figures or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the high visibility or onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments As a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed Furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected In addition actions taken or statements made by athletes teams or leagues or other endorsers associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or endorsers could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition In addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes public figures or sports organizations to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability 2020 FORM 10K 11 Table of Contents Economic factors beyond our control and changes in the global economic environment including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which creates exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates Additionally there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union commonly referred to as Brexit or new or proposed US policy changes that impact the US Dollar value relative to other international currencies Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into US Dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the US Dollar adversely affects the US Dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger US Dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker US Dollar or other trading currency Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the US Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition generally without requiring collateral To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty In the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts retailers may be more cautious with orders A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition In addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products Failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins reduced cash flows and harm to our business To meet anticipated demand for our products we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows Conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows from period to period A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties Our NIKE Direct operations including our retail stores and digital platforms have required and will continue to require significant investment Our NIKE Direct stores have required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms Because of their unique design and technological elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores Due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail stores a decline in sales a shift in consumer behavior away from brickandmortar retail or the closure temporary or 2020 FORM 10K 12 Table of Contents otherwise or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs Many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond our control pose risks and uncertainties Risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation In addition we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our NIKE Direct operations and our digital offerings will require co ntinued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms In order to deliver highquality digital experiences our digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control We may not be successful in developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards A growing portion of consumers access our NIKE Direct digital platforms but in the event that it is more difficult for consumers to access and use our digital platforms consumers find that our digital platforms do not effectively meet their needs or expectations or consumers choose not to access or use our digital platforms or use devices that do not offer access to our platforms the success of our NIKE Direct operations could be adversely impacted Our competitors may develop or have already developed digital experiences features content services or technologies that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance We may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment in our NIKE Direct operations and managements attention from our other business opportunities could be diverted which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations If the technologybased systems that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base could be materially adversely affected Many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms Increasingly consumers are using mobilebased devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital experiences that are offered on mobile platforms We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience Any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable userfriendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales harm our reputation with consumers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations In addition as use of our digital platforms continues to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy our consumers needs If we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business We are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the Internet and thirdparty services Information Technology Systems across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown For example our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems Over a number of years we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate Our work to integrate secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts We cannot provide assurance however that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect our Information Technology Systems and prevent cyberattacks system failures or data or information loss The failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers malware natural disasters vendor business interruptions or other causes or failure to properly maintain protect repair or upgrade systems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all 2020 FORM 10K 13 Table of Contents eventualities and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition Further like other companies in the retail industry we have in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience cyberattacks including phishing and other attempts to breach or gain unauthorized access to our systems To date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future We also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans or those of our vendors do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage Furthermore we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing digital commerce consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues damage to our reputation and loss of users We are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations As a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels If we or our employees agents suppliers and other partners fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations such failure could subject us to fines sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations We are involved in various types of claims lawsuits regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business our products and the actions of our employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability antitrust trademark rights and a variety of other matters It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation The global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks such as antibribery anticorruption fraud trade environmental competition privacy and other regulatory matters will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time which could adversely affect us In addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees Changes to US or other countries trade policies and tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations Changes in US or international social political regulatory and economic conditions could impact our business financial condition and results of operations In particular political and economic instability geopolitical conflicts political unrest civil strife terrorist activity acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties in the United States or internationally could interrupt and negatively affect the sale of our products or other business operations Any negative sentiment toward the United States as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business In addition changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business The US presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the US economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the US and other countries where we conduct our business It may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes Changes or proposed changes in US or other countries trade policies may result in restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade Tariffs and other changes in US trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain US goods Further any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the United States or in other countries could affect the trade environment The Company similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the United States and foreign countries including governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or economic sanctions Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the US economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we conduct operations our industry and the global demand for our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 2020 FORM 10K 14 Table of Contents Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business We periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others We also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe on their intellectual property rights Defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights These actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective For example confidential information related to business strategy innovations new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely inadvertently or improperly used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation loss of intellectual property rights a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions In addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the United States and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we handle transactional and personal information about our wholesale customers and consumers and users of our digital experiences which include online distribution channels and product engagement adaptive products and personal fitness applications Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social engineering such as phishing and largescale complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time Any breach of our or our service providers network or other vendor systems may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data misappropriation of our consumers users or employees personal information or a disruption of our business Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business including unwanted media attention impairment of our consumer and customer relationships damage to our reputation resulting in lost sales and consumers fines lawsuits or significant legal and remediation expenses We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against respond to andor redress problems caused by any breach In addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous and sometimes conflicting regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States Europe and elsewhere For example the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation the GDPR which became effective on May 25 2018 and California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act the CCPA which became effective on January 1 2020 These laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored Compliance with existing proposed and recently enacted laws including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under GDPR and CCPA and regulations can be costly and time consuming and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others imposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States Accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products This includes for example the uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the United States and elsewhere as further described below under We could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate and Changes to US or other countries trade policies and tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and 2020 FORM 10K 15 Table of Contents results of operations The US presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage US corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the United States which may require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations The administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain US multinational corporations in public statements which if directed at us could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business In addition disease outbreaks including the current COVID19 pandemic terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad These factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected In addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Furthermore we are subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as the anticorruption laws of other countries in which we operate Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business reputation and operating results Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing The principal materials used in our apparel products natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place The principal materials used in our footwear products natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather natural and synthetic fabrics and threads nylon canvas and polyurethane films are also locally available to manufacturers Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all Further our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products In addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner If we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements In addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards Any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm Because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance In addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins Changes in US trade policies including new and potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect our results of operations In addition Sojitz America performs importexport financing services and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain countries and any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could have an 2020 FORM 10K 16 Table of Contents adverse effect on our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the countries in which Sojitz provides services which could in turn adversely affect our sales and profitability We could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate We are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in any jurisdiction subject to significant change We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions For example effective January 1 2020 the tax law in the Netherlands one of the Companys major jurisdictions changed Other proposals to reform foreign tax laws could significantly impact how US multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings We also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters These holidays and rulings expire in whole or in part from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met The impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate For example in January 2019 the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company If this matter is adversely resolved the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and the Companys Netherlands income taxes in the future could increase We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service IRS and other tax authorities We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made For example we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products The athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores and accelerating digital commerce capabilities The market shares of these retailers may increase through acquisitions and construction of additional stores and investments in digital capacity and as a result of attrition as struggling retailers exit the market Consolidation of our retailers will concentrate our credit risk with a smaller set of retailers any of whom may experience declining sales or a shortage of liquidity including as a result of the COVID19 pandemic In addition increasing market share concentration among a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find sufficient retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues We are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands We currently license and expect to continue licensing certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations customer relationships labor relationships supplier relationships or credit risks it could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental 2020 FORM 10K 17 Table of Contents health and safety standards for the benefit of workers We also require our direct contractors and the contractors of our licensees to comply with applicable standards for product safety Notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors If one or more of our direct or indirect contractors violates or fails to comply with or is accused of violating or failing to comply with such standards and laws this could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition Negative publicity regarding production methods alleged unethical or illegal practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales force us to locate alternative suppliers manufacturers or licenses or result in the imposition of additional regulations including new or additional quotas tariffs product safety regulations or other regulatory measures by governmental authorities If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses As part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions In addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad As a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products NIKE is supplied by 122 footwear factories located in 12 countries We do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell In fiscal 2020 four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2020 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 61 of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2020 Our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship including due to changes in applicable trade policies or be unable to perform including as a result of the COVID19 pandemic we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations Additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations Certain of our manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product Such manufacturing partners may go out of business if consumer preferences or market conditions change such that there is no longer sufficient demand for the types of products they produce If in the future the relevant products are again in demand and the specialized manufacturers no longer exist we may not be able to locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain products in a timely manner or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations Our success depends on our global distribution facilities We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world Our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities Our distribution facilities have in the past and could be interrupted by information technology problems disasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or government actions taken to mitigate their spread Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business We maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities The market for prime real estate is competitive Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases In addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing 2020 FORM 10K 18 Table of Contents locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition Additionally the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers manufacturers customers distribution centers headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition Moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and tsunamis whether occurring in the United States or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues have in the past temporarily disrupted and could in the future disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past and could result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition In particular if a natural disaster were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers manufacturers customers distribution centers and vendors are located our continued success would depend in part on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties computer telecommunication and other systems and operations In addition a severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an adverse impact on consumer spending any of which could in turn result in negative pointofsale trends for our merchandise Further climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters which may affect our business operations either in a particular region or globally as well as the activities of our thirdparty vendors and other suppliers manufacturers and customers In addition the physical changes prompted by climate change could result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences which could in turn affect our business operating results and financial condition We believe the diversity of locations in which we operate our operational size and our Information Technology Systems position us well but if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event we could still experience operational challenges in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel Further if we are unable to find alternative suppliers replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our Information Technology Systems or supply systems we could be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers These events could result in reputational damage lost sales cancellation charges or markdowns all of which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns From time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our NIKE Direct operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention We believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations See also Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties The success of our business depends in part on highquality employees including key personnel as well as our ability to maintain our workplace culture and values Our success depends in part on the continued service of highquality employees including key executive officers and personnel The loss of the services of key individuals or any negative perception with respect to these individuals or our workplace culture or values could harm our business Our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel In addition shifts in US immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States W e also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success and we have invested substantial time and resources in building maintaining and evolving our culture Any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success including our ability to retain and recruit employees 2020 FORM 10K 19 Table of Contents Our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to United States or foreign employment regulations We have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce including wage and hour laws and regulations fair labor standards minimum wage requirements overtime pay unemployment tax rates workers compensation rates citizenship requirements and payroll taxes which could have a direct impact on our operating costs A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforces could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases all of which may cause us to incur additional costs There is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment health and safety wage and hour laws criminal activity personal injury and other claims In addition if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements we could be vulnerable to a strike work stoppage or other labor action which could have an adverse effect on our business The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock As of June 30 2020 Swoosh LLC beneficially owned approximately 75 of our Class A Common Stock If on June 30 2020 all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16 The shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the US securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh LLC The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock Swoosh LLC was formed by Philip H Knight our Chairman Emeritus to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock Swoosh LLC is controlled by Mr Knights son and NIKE director Travis Knight Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options Our longterm debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard Poors and Moodys Investors Service If our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for our existing facilities or for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to the unsecured credit market or the capital markets could be adversely affected We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to among other things incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments pledge assets as security make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default and as a result the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated In addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt If our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory reserves contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets hedge accounting for derivatives stockbased compensation income taxes and other contingencies Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock 2020 FORM 10K 20 Table of Contents Antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock There are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect threequarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number However such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company We may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts opinions of our future performance which may in part be based upon any guidance we have provided Analysts estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline In the past securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities If our stock price is volatile for any reason we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future Any litigation could result in reputational damage substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NIKE designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world We sell our products through NIKEowned retail stores and through digital platforms which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses Our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative musthave products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail Since fiscal 2018 through the Consumer Direct Offense and our Triple Double strategy we have focused on doubling the impact of innovation increasing our speed and agility to market and growing our direct connections with consumers In June 2020 we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy Consumer Direct Acceleration This strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas First creating the marketplace of the future through more premium consistent and seamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need This strategy will lead with NIKE Digital and our own stores as well as through select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision Second we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Mens Womens and Kids This approach allows us to create product that better meets individual consumer needs including more specialization of our category approach while realigning and simplifying our offense to accelerate our largest growth opportunities In particular well be reinvesting in our Womens and Kids businesses and will also simplify our operating model across the remainder of the company to optimize effectiveness Third we will unify investments in data and analytics demand sensing insight gathering inventory management and other areas against an endtoend technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally On July 22 2020 management announced a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up strategic execution These changes are expected to lead to a net loss of jobs resulting in pretax onetime employee termination costs of approximately 200 million to 250 million which is expected to be incurred primarily during the first half of fiscal 2021 in the form of cash expenditures These amounts are subject to change until such time as all details are finalized This next phase of our Consumer Direct Offense is expected to drive sustainable growth and profitability as we accelerate NIKE to a digitalfirst company We are committed to the execution of this strategy despite the shortterm adverse impacts to our business from a novel strain of coronavirus COVID19 As such our longterm financial goals on average per year remain the same and are outlined below High singledigit revenue growth Gross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points Slight selling and administrative expense leverage Midteens earnings per share growth and Lowthirties percentage rate of return on invested capital COVID19 UPDATE COVID19 was first identified in Wuhan China in December 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization To date COVID19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas As a result COVID19 has impacted our business globally including through store closures reduced operating hours and decreased retail traffic In particular the outbreak and preventive measures taken to help curb the spread had material adverse impacts on our operations and business results in Greater China during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 following the temporary closure of or reduced operating hours in approximately 75 of NIKEowned and partner stores within the region During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 our results of operations were further impacted as approximately 90 of our NIKE Brand stores across North America EMEA and APLA excluding Korea were closed for approximately 8 weeks The majority of Converse direct to consumer stores were also closed for a significant portion of the fourth quarter Additionally certain of our wholesale partners closed stores or reduced operating hours during the fourth quarter resulting in lower than expected sales and a slowing of receipt of shipments of our products The combined effect of store closures and reduced wholesale shipments caused higher than normal inventory levels at May 31 2020 as Inventories grew 31 compared to the prior year In order to manage future inventory growth and ensure a return to normalized levels we are modifying our buying plans and canceling certain preCOVID19 factory purchases shifting product offer dates to meet nearterm demand as well as shifting available inventory into our digital channel and increasing digital fulfillment capacity specifically in 2020 FORM 10K 27 Table of Contents North America and EMEA Additionally we are investing in targeted promotions and markdowns to accelerate liquidation of excess inventory while continuing to protect the longterm health of our product franchises COVID19 also impacted our distribution centers our thirdparty manufacturing partners and other vendors including through the effects of facility closures reductions in operating hours labor shortages and real time changes in operating procedures to accommodate social distancing guidelines and additional cleaning and disinfection procedures In response to the uncertainty of the pandemic described above we enhanced our liquidity position during the fourth quarter through the issuance of 6 billion in senior unsecured notes the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program and by entering into a new committed credit facility agreement which provides for an additional 2 billion of borrowings Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional discussion Throughout the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 our digital commerce remained open supported by the employees in the distribution centers During the fourth quarter NIKE Brand digital remained our fastest growing channel growing 79 on a currencyneutral basis with each of our geographies growing over 50 Beginning in midMay stores within our NIKE Direct operations gradually began reopening As of July 17 2020 over 90 of our NIKE Direct stores have reopened across the globe with 100 open in Greater China over 90 open in both EMEA and North America and APLA open over 70 As of July 17 2020 substantially all Converse direct to consumer stores have reopened to serve consumers We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities including federal state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations In these circumstances there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan As such given the dynamic nature of this situation the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of COVID19 on our future financial condition results of operations or cash flows However we do expect they will have a material adverse impact on our future revenue growth as well as our overall profitability and may continue to lead to higher than normal inventory levels in various markets revised payment terms with certain of our wholesale customers higher salesrelated reserves factory cancellation costs and a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across the Companys jurisdictions On March 27 2020 in response to COVID19 the United States government enacted the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act the CARES Act The CARES Act is a relief package consisting of various stimulus measures such as tax payment deferrals various business incentives and makes certain technical corrections to the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 The enactment of such legislation while favorable did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2020

than offset by a decline of 820 basis points in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 primarily due the impacts of COVID19 For fiscal 2020 NIKE Inc gross margin decreased 130 basis points as higher fullprice average selling price ASP on a wholesale equivalent basis was more than offset by higher product costs due to incremental tariffs in the US as well as factory cancellation charges higher inventory obsolescence reserves and the negative rate impacts of supply chain costs on a lower volume of wholesale shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead expense partially offset by lower demand creation expense Operating overhead expense increased due to higher wagerelated expenses as a result of our continued investment in endtoend digital capabilities and higher bad debt expense partially offset by lower travel and related spend Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower retail brand presentation costs and sports marketing expenses as sporting events were postponed or canceled and a majority of stores were closed globally during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 These decreases were partially offset by higher digital brand marketing costs Diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2 decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchase program As we continue to execute against the Consumer Direct Offense we are focused on optimizing country operating models across our global portfolio and we remain committed to investing in our most significant growth opportunities During the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we announced our intention to sell our NIKE Brand businesses in Brazil Argentina Chile and Uruguay to

transactions are expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2021 As a result of this decision the related assets and liabilities of these entities were classified as heldforsale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31 2020 Additionally we recognized a nonrecurring impairment charge of 405 million within Other income expense net on the Consolidated Statements of Income classified within Corporate This charge was primarily due to the anticipated release of noncash cumulative foreign currency translation losses and could fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates up to the date of close In future quarters as we shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor operating model within these countries we expect consolidated NIKE Inc and APLA revenue growth will be reduced due to differences in commercial terms However we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses as well as lessen exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility On October 29 2019 we signed a definitive agreement to sell the assets and liabilities of our whollyowned subsidiary brand Hurley The transaction closed on December 6 2019 and the impacts of the divestiture are not considered material to the Company While foreign currency markets remain volatile in part due to geopolitical dynamics leading to a stronger US Dollar we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability We remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for

United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 23 2019 USE OF NONGAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10K we discuss nonGAAP financial measures including references to wholesale equivalent revenues currencyneutral revenues as well as Total NIKE Brand earnings before interest and taxes EBIT and Total NIKE Inc EBIT which should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of 1 sales to external wholesale customers and 2 internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers Additionally currencyneutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations EBIT is calculated as Net Income before Interest expense income net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income Management uses these nonGAAP financial measures when evaluating the Companys performance including when making financial and operating decisions Additionally management believes these nonGAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends However references to wholesale equivalent revenues currencyneutral revenues and EBIT should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with US

approximately 4 percentage points partially offset by revenue growth in Greater China contributing approximately 2 percentage points On a currencyneutral basis NIKE Brand footwear revenues decreased 2 for fiscal 2020 driven by declines in nearly all key categories primarily Running Sportswear and Training partially offset by growth in the Jordan Brand Unit sales of footwear decreased 8 partially offset by higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points The increase in ASP was primarily due to higher fullprice and NIKE Direct ASPs as well as the favorable impact of growth in

by growth in Sportswear and the Jordan Brand Unit sales of apparel decreased 8 partially offset by higher ASP per unit contributing approximately 5 percentage points The increase in ASP was primarily

fiscal 2020 compared to 32 for fiscal 2019 Digital commerce sales were 55 billion for fiscal 2020 compared to 38 billion for fiscal 2019 On a currencyneutral basis NIKE Direct revenues increased 8 for fiscal 2020 driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 49 which more than offset comparable store sales contraction of 12 due to temporary store closures and stores operating on reduced hours as a result of COVID19 Comparable store sales which exclude digital commerce sales comprises revenues from NIKEowned inline and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have

reflected growth in the Korea and SOCO which comprises Argentina Uruguay and Chile territories of 14 and 6 respectively partially offset by declines in Mexico of 9 Revenues increased in several key categories led by the Jordan Brand NIKE Direct revenues increased 12 fueled by strong digital commerce sales growth of 62 and the addition of new stores partially offset by a decline in comparable

growth in the Jordan Brand and NIKE Basketball was offset by declines in all other key categories primarily Training Unit sales of footwear decreased 12 offset by higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 12 percentage points driven by higher fullprice and NIKE Direct ASPs both of which in part reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory Currencyneutral apparel revenues grew 3 for fiscal 2020 driven by higher revenues in several key categories most notably Sportswear Unit sales of apparel decreased 5 which were more than offset by higher ASP per unit contributing approximately 8 percentage points primarily driven by higher fullprice and NIKE Direct ASPs both of which in part reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory Reported EBIT decreased 11 for fiscal 2020 reflecting lower revenues and gross margin contraction partially offset by lower selling and administrative expense Gross margin decreased 140 basis points as higher fullprice ASP was more than offset by higher product costs unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates as well as higher other costs The increase in other costs primarily occurred in the fourth quarter due to COVID19 and reflected increased warehousing and freight as well as higher inventory obsolescence Selling and administrative expense decreased as lower demand creation expense was partially offset by higher operating overhead expense The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily due to lower sports marketing costs advertising and marketing expenses as well as lower retail brand presentation costs as sporting events were postponed or canceled and a majority of stores were closed during the fourth quarter due to COVID19 The increase in operating overhead expense was primarily due to higher bad debt expense and higher wagerelated costs 2020 FORM 10K 39 Table of Contents GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS Dollars in millions FISCAL 2020 FISCAL 2019 CHANGE CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY

product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse related foreign currency hedge results conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments For fiscal 2020 Corporate includes the nonrecurring impairment charge recognized as a result of our decision to transition our NIKE Brand business operations in Brazil Argentina Chile and Uruguay to thirdparty distributors This charge primarily reflects the anticipated release of associated noncash cumulative foreign currency translation losses FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 The Corporate loss before interest and taxes increased 157 million primarily due to the following an unfavorable change of 494 million primarily due to the 405 million nonrecurring impairment charge discussed above For more information see Note 20 Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements a favorable change of 213 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse net of hedge gains and losses these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin and a favorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of 124 million related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments reported as a component of consolidated Other income expense net FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES OVERVIEW As a global company with significant operations outside the United States in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into US Dollars Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE Inc We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options As described below the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company NTC and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact 2020 FORM 10K 41 Table of Contents of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are Product Costs NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways 1 Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity a Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from thirdparty factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC b Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from thirdparty factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar In both purchasing scenarios a weaker US Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger US Dollar increases its cost 2 Factory input costs NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures Under this program our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a thirdparty All currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other income expense net Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating US Dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening US Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKEs US Dollar inventory cost Conversely a weakening US Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost NonFunctional Currency Denominated External Sales A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro eg the British Pound but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency These sales generate a foreign currency exposure Other Costs Nonfunctional currency denominated costs such as endorsement contracts also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent In certain cases the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other income expense net Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail NonFunctional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables including intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other income expense net within our consolidated results of operations MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above Generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements 2020 FORM 10K 42 Table of Contents Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments Accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other income expense net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the US Dollar Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into US Dollars for consolidated reporting The translation of foreign subsidiaries nonUS Dollar denominated balance sheets into US Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income loss within Shareholders equity In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income a weaker US Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger US Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately 867 million a detriment of approximately 1236 million and a benefit of approximately 832 million for the years ended May 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately 212 million a detriment of approximately 233 million and a benefit of approximately 177 million for the years ended May 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively Management generally identifies hyperinflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a threeyear period exceeds 100 Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyperinflationary market As a result beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the US Dollar As of and for the period ended May 31 2020 this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into US Dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these US Dollar denominated investments at nonUS Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under US GAAP We utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these US Dollar investments The combination of the purchase and sale of the US Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold Hedges of the purchase of US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other income expense net had an unfavorable impact of approximately 91 million 97 million and 110 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the US Dollar which could adversely impact the US Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings We have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with US GAAP There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2020 and 2019 There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31 2020 2019 and 2018 2020 FORM 10K 43 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW ACTIVITY Cash provided used by operations was an inflow of 2485 million for fiscal 2020 compared to 5903 million for fiscal 2019 Net income adjusted for noncash items generated 3730 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2020 compared to 5341 million for fiscal 2019 The decrease primarily reflects lower Net Income resulting from the unfavorable impacts of COVID19 The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided used by operations of 1245 million for fiscal 2020 compared to an increase of 562 million for fiscal 2019 The net change in working capital was impacted by a 1364 million increase in Inventories in part reflecting lower shipments to our wholesale customers and store closures within our NIKE Direct operations as well as a decrease in Accounts Payabl e resulting from lower spending both of which are due to COVID19 The net change in working capital was also unfavorably impacted by the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging transactions During fiscal 2020 cash collateral received from counterparties decreased 289 million compared to an increase of 266 million in fiscal 2019 Refer to the Credit Risk section of Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details In addition the net change in working capital was impacted by a 1509 million reduction in Accounts receivable net in fiscal 2020 primarily driven by lower revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the impacts of COVID19 Cash provided used by investing activities was an outflow of 1028 million for fiscal 2020 compared to an outflow of 264 million for fiscal 2019 driven primarily by lower proceeds from the net change in shortterm investments During fiscal 2020 the net change in investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash inflow of 27 million compared to 850 million in fiscal 2019 Additionally during fiscal 2020 we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth specifically focused around digital capabilities our endtoend technology foundation our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain We expect this trend to continue in future periods Cash provided used by financing activities was an inflow of 2491 million for fiscal 2020 compared to an outflow of 5293 million for fiscal 2019 primarily due to the net proceeds from a 5942 million corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as lower share repurchases during fiscal 2020 In fiscal 2020 we purchased 335 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for 3033 million an average price of 9049 per share under the fouryear 15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018 As of May 31 2020 we had repurchased 452 million shares at a cost of 4019 million an average price of 8900 per share under this new program We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows excess cash andor proceeds from debt To enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID19 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existing share repurchase program The existing program remains authorized by the Board of Directors and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time depending upon market conditions our capital needs and other factors CAPITAL RESOURCES On July 23 2019 we filed a shelf registration statement the Shelf with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time The Shelf expires on July 23 2022 On March 27 2020 we issued 6 billion of senior unsecured notes with tranches maturing March 27 2025 March 27 2027 March 27 2030 March 27 2040 and March 27 2050 For additional information regarding our longterm debt refer to Note 8 LongTerm Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements On August 16 2019 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings up to 3 billion in total upon lender approval The facility matures on August 16 2024 with a oneyear extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 16 2026 This facility replaces the prior 2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on August 28 2015 which would have matured August 28 2020 On April 6 2020 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings in addition to the existing credit facility discussed above The new facility matures on April 5 2021 As of May 31 2020 and 2019 no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities We currently have longterm debt ratings of AA and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively As it relates to our committed credit facility entered into on August 16 2019 if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fee and interest rate would increase Conversely if our longterm debt ratings were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease Under the committed credit facility entered into on April 6 2020 if our longterm debt ratings were to decline only the interest rate would increase but would remain unchanged in the event our longterm debt rating were to improve Changes in our longterm debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities Under these facilities we have agreed to various covenants These 2020 FORM 10K 44 Table of Contents covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable As of May 31 2020 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future Liquidity is also provided by our 4 billion commercial paper program which we increased by 2 billion during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 During the fiscal year ended May 31 2020 the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was 1456 million As of May 31 2020 we had 248 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 165 No commercial paper was outstanding as of May 31 2019 We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs We currently have shortterm debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively To date in fiscal 2020 we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets however future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets As of May 31 2020 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 88 billion primarily consisting of commercial paper corporate notes deposits held at major banks money market funds US government sponsored enterprise obligations US Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities Our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk While individual securities have varying durations as of May 31 2020 the weightedaverage days to maturity of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 14 days We believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed We indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings Should we require additional capital in the United States we may determine to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt Given our existing structure if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor Currently we have several such agreements in place Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations CONTRACTUAL

for their use It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives In addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 3 We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms In some cases prices are subject to change throughout the production

all of the benefits of the product Transfer of control passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer Control passes to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment Prior to fiscal 2019 the requirements for recognizing revenue were met upon delivery to the customer The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions As part of our revenue recognition policy consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against Revenues with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Prior to fiscal 2019 reserve balances were reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for product returns and recognized within Accounts receivable ne t for wholesale transactions and Accrued liabilities for our direct to consumer business on the Consolidated Balance Sheets The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns Provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date Estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded If actual or expected future returns discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made Refer also to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16 Revenues for additional information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements INVENTORY RESERVES We make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS A significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts In general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract However certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year When we determine payments are probable the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance In these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which we record in Cost of sales as the related sales occur For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments we 2020 FORM 10K 47 Table of Contents record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITELIVED ASSETS We review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss rather than Net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income In most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions By their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions When the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss to Other income expense net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs In rare circumstances the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence INCOME TAXES We are subject to taxation in the United States as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws On an interim basis we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate Income tax expense The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur As the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year When this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary Realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain At least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made We have not recorded withholding tax expense for foreign earnings we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested within certain of our foreign jurisdictions The amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore is due to the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore operations and our expectations of the future cash needs of our US and foreign entities Withholding tax consequences are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation Despite this approach because the determination is based on expected working capital and other capital needs in jurisdictions where the earnings are generated the possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated For instance the actual cash needs of our US operations may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations This would result in additional withholding tax expense in the year we determined amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 2020 FORM 10K 48 Table of Contents On a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense On December 22 2017 the United States enacted the Tax Act which significantly changed previous US tax laws including provisions for a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after December 31 2017 among other changes The Tax Act also transitions US international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on nonUS earnings which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to US taxation Certain provisions of the Tax Act including a provision to tax global intangible lowtaxed income GILTI of foreign subsidiaries were not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019 In accordance with US GAAP the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense Implementation of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 We completed our analysis of the Tax Act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information OTHER CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 2020 FORM 10K 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions We have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements The timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31 2020 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for EuroUS Dollar British PoundEuro Japanese YenUS Dollar and Chinese YuanUS Dollar currency pairs Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs To achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT We monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and ValueatRisk VaR Our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only The VaR determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variancecovariance technique These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding oneyear period The value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors The estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the VaR model was 48 million and 34 million at May 31 2020 and 2019 respectively The VaR increased yearoveryear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities at May 31 2020 Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 126 million and 83 million during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively 2020 FORM 10K 50 Table of Contents The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt and fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation Furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the VaR calculation above Therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows Details of thirdparty debt are provided in the table below The table presents principal cash flows

Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that i relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and ii involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matter below providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates Accounting for Income Taxes As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements the Company recorded income tax expense of 348 million for the year ended May 31 2020 and has net deferred tax assets of 732 million including a valuation allowance of 26 million and total gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding related interest and penalties of 771 million as of May 31 2020 536 million of which would affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognized in future periods The Company is subject to taxation in the United States as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions As disclosed by management the use of significant judgment and estimates as well as the interpretation and application of complex tax laws is required by management to determine its provision for income taxes The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for income taxes is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing complex tax laws and regulations including new temporary regulations and recent court rulings as it relates to determining the provision for income taxes and other tax positions This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the provision for income taxes and other tax positions In addition the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the provision for income taxes and other tax positions These procedures also included among others evaluating the effect on the Companys tax provision of changes in its legal entity structure and tax laws testing

Standard Codification Topic 605 Revenue Recognition Topic 605 are included below in the event they are substantially different Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear apparel and equipment as well as Converse products comprise a single performance obligation which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer based on the terms of sale A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product Transfer of control passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer Control passes to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment Prior to fiscal 2019 the requirements for recognizing revenue were met upon delivery to the customer The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions Consideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through salesbased or usagebased royalty arrangements and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction and are collected by the Company from a customer are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues are recognized SALESRELATED RESERVES Consideration promised in the Companys contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Prior to fiscal 2019 the Companys reserve balances were reported net of the 2020 FORM 10K 62 Table of Contents estimated cost of inventory for product returns and recognized within Accounts receivable net for wholesale transactions and Accrued liabilities for the Companys direct to consumer business on the Consolidated Balance Sheets The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns Provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date Estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded If actual or expected future returns discounts or claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves established a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made COST OF SALES Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs as well as warehousing costs including the cost of warehouse labor thirdparty royalties certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs including costs of endorsement contracts complimentary product television digital and print advertising and media costs brand events and retail brand presentation Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run Advertising media costs are expensed when the advertisement appears Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is complete and delivered A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts In general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract However certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport eg winning a championship The Company records Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year When the Company determines payments are probable the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Companys best estimate of the endorsers performance In these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the Companys estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which the Company records in Cost of sales as the related sales occur For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense Through cooperative advertising programs the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products The Company records these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time it is obligated to its customers for the costs This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run Total advertising and promotion expenses which the

440 million respectively was recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applied 2020 FORM 10K 63 Table of Contents OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE Operating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefitrelated expenses research and development costs bad debt expense as well as other administrative expenses such as rent depreciation and amortization professional services meetings and travel CASH AND EQUIVALENTS Cash and equivalents represent cash and shortterm highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates including commercial paper US Treasury US Agency money market funds time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase SHORTTERM INVESTMENTS Shortterm investments consist of highly liquid investments including commercial paper US Treasury US Agency time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase Debt securities the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost At May 31 2020 and 2019 the Company did not hold any shortterm investments classified as trading or heldtomaturity At May 31 2020 and 2019 Shortterm investments consisted of availableforsale debt securities which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of tax in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification The Company considers all availableforsale debt securities including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within Shortterm investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys shortterm investments ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable net consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations the Company considers historical levels of credit losses as well as macroeconomic and industry trends such as the impacts of COVID19 to determine the amount of the allowance Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered noncurrent and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was 214 million and 30 million as of May 31 2020 and 2019 respectively INVENTORY VALUATION Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis In some instances the Company ships product directly from its suppliers to the customer with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Companys suppliers as well as inbound freight import duties taxes insurance and logistics and other handling fees PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION Property plant and equipment are recorded at cost Depreciation is determined on a straightline basis for land improvements buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS Internal Use Software Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 12 year period on a straightline basis The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software In addition the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects 2020 FORM 10K 64 Table of Contents The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities training maintenance and all other postimplementation stage activities are expensed as incurred Computer Software to be Sold Leased or Otherwise Marketed Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers In most instances the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established Therefore software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred IMPAIRMENT OF LONGLIVED ASSETS The Company reviews the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value GOODWILL AND INDEFINITELIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment the Company allocates goodwill across its reporting units which are considered the Companys operating segments The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount an impairment test is unnecessary If an impairment test is necessary the Company will estimate the fair value of its related reporting units If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value Indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the Company determines it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets the Company primarily utilizes the relieffromroyalty method This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenues for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital If the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible exceeds its fair value the asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value OPERATING LEASES Beginning in fiscal 2020 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU No 201602 Leases Topic 842 Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with the Companys historical accounting policies The Companys lease recognition policies under Topic 842 are described in the following paragraphs 2020 FORM 10K 65 Table of Contents The Company primarily leases retail store space certain distribution and warehouse facilities office space equipment and other nonreal estate assets The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at the commencement date which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the asset Rightofuse ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term with lease expense recognized on a straightline basis The Companys incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable Lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses renewal or termination options rent holidays or certain landlord incentives including tenant improvement allowances ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced by the amount of lease incentives The lease term includes the noncancelable period of the lease and options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options Certain lease agreements include variable lease payments which are based on a percent of retail sales over specified levels or adjust periodically for inflation as a result of changes in a published index primarily the Consumer Price Index FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives equity securities and availableforsale debt securities Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date The Company uses a threelevel hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques market approach income approach and cost approach The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active Level 3 Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing Observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates forward pricing curves currency volatilities currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties The Companys fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for additional information FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into US Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income loss in Total shareholders equity The Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement the impact of which is recorded in Other income expense net within the Consolidated Statements of Income ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of Total shareholders equity Longterm debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and if designated the extent to which the hedge is effective The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items For undesignated 2020 FORM 10K 66 Table of Contents hedges and designated cash flow hedges this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For designated net investment hedges this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For the Companys fair value hedges which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives STOCKBASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value net of estimated forfeitures of equity awards and recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense as applicable in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straightline basis over the vesting period Substantially all awards vest ratably over four years of continued employment with stock options expiring ten years from the date of grant The fair value of options stock appreciation rights and employees purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans ESPPs is determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant Refer to Note 11 Common Stock and StockBased Compensation for additional information on the Companys stockbased compensation programs INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes for further discussion EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards Refer to Note 12 Earnings Per Share for further discussion MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ from these estimates Additionally the extent to which the evolving COVID19 pandemic impacts the Companys financial statements will depend on a number of factors including the magnitude and duration of the pandemic The Company expects it may have a material adverse impact on future revenue growth as well as overall profitability and may continue to lead to higher than normal inventory levels revised payment terms with certain wholesale customers higher salesrelated reserves factory cancellation costs and a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across the Companys jurisdictions 2020 FORM 10K 67 Table of Contents RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In February 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No 201602 Leases Topic 842 which replaced existing lease accounting guidance The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record ROU assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet ROU assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease The new guidance requires the Company to continue to classify leases as either an operating or finance lease with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement In addition the new standard requires enhanced disclosure surrounding the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing agreements In July 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 201811 which provided entities with an additional transition method Under the new transition method an entity initially applies the new standard at the adoption date versus at the beginning of the earliest period presented and recognizes a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption The Company elected this transition method and adopted Topic 842 using a modified retrospective approach in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognized in Retained earnings at June 1 2019 Comparative prior period information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported in accordance with previous lease accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 840 Leases Upon adoption the Company elected the package of transition practical expedients which allowed the Company to carry forward prior conclusions related to i whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases ii the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and iii initial direct costs for existing leases Additionally the Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease components from nonlease components for all real estate leases within the portfolio The Company made an accounting policy election to not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will recognize related lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straightline basis over the lease term In preparation for implementation the Company executed changes to business processes including implementing a software solution to assist with the new reporting requirements The adoption of Topic 842 resulted in a 27 billion increase to total assets and total liabilities as of June 1 2019 Upon adoption the Company recognized 32 billion of total operating lease liabilities and 29 billion of operating lease ROU assets as well as removed 348 million of existing deferred rent liabilities which was recorded as an offset against the ROU assets In addition the Company removed 184 million of existing assets and liabilities related to buildtosuit lease arrangements Several other asset and liability line items in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets were also impacted by immaterial amounts The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For more information on the Companys lease arrangements refer to Note 19 Leases In October 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201616 Income Taxes Topic 740 IntraEntity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory The updated guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs Income tax effects of intraentity transfers of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party The Company adopted the standard on June 1 2018 using a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of applying the new standard recognized in Retained earnings at the date of adoption The adoption resulted in reductions to Retained earnings Deferred income taxes and other assets and Prepaid expenses and other current assets of 507 million 422 million and 45 million respectively and an increase in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities of 40 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets 2020 FORM 10K 68 Table of Contents NOTE 2 INVENTORIES Inventory balances of 7367 million and 5622

is exposed to global market risks including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under US GAAP The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions and assessing both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of the hedging relationships The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31 2020 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for EuroUS Dollar British PoundEuro Japanese YenUS Dollar and Chinese YuanUS Dollar currency pairs All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date The

Other income expense net CASH FLOW HEDGES All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction Effective hedge results are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be discontinued when it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period The gains and losses associated with discontinued derivative instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be recognized immediately in Other income expense net if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two month period thereafter In rare circumstances the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding the Company accounts for the derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below The purpose of the Companys foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Companys consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues demand creation expenses investments in US Dollar denominated availableforsale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions Product cost exposures are primarily generated through nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below NIKE entities primarily purchase product in two ways 1 Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC 2 Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in US Dollars 2020 FORM 10K 83 Table of Contents These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to the Companys existing foreign currency exposures Under this program the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges For all currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was 81 billion as of May 31 2020 As of May 31 2020 approximately 374 million of deferred net gains net of tax on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature As of May 31 2020 the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months FAIR VALUE HEDGES The Company has in the past been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related longterm debt meet the shortcut method requirements under US GAAP Accordingly changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying longterm debt The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31 2020 NET INVESTMENT HEDGES The Company has in the past hedged and may in the future hedge the risk of variability in foreign currencydenominated net investments in whollyowned international operations All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2020 UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets andor the embedded derivative contracts These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other income expense net together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position andor embedded derivative contract The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was 41 billion as of May 31 2020 EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the US Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory In addition embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other income expense net through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist 2020 FORM 10K 84 Table of Contents At May 31 2020 the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately 281 million CREDIT RISK The Company is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings however this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted To manage this risk the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored The Companys derivative contracts contain credit riskrelated contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business The Companys bilateral creditrelated contingent features generally require the owing entity either the Company or the derivative counterparty to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of 50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than 50 million Additionally a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements As of May 31 2020 the Company was in compliance with all credit riskrelated contingent features and had derivative instruments with such features in a net liability position of 137 million However no derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features in a net liability position were greater than 50 million by counterparty Accordingly the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features Further as of May 31 2020 the Company had received no cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial For additional information related to the Companys derivative financial instruments and collateral refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements 2020 FORM 10K 85 Table of Contents NOTE 15 ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS The changes in Accumulated other comprehensive
