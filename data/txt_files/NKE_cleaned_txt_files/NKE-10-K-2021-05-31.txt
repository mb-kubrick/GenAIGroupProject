exceeded those in the second and third quarters However the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic strategic operating and logisticsrelated factors as evidenced by the impact of the COVID19 pandemic Because NIKE is a consumer products company the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities as well as changing design trends affect the demand for our products We must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability This is a continuing risk Refer to Item 1A Risk Factors We report our NIKE Brand

subsidiary with facilities near Beaverton Oregon in Dong Nai Province Vietnam and St Charles Missouri as well as independent contractors in China and Vietnam were our suppliers of materials and cushioning components used in footwear Air Manufacturing Innovation also manufactures and sells small amounts of various other plastic products to other manufacturers The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics yarns and threads both virgin and recycled specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat and repel rain andor snow and plastic and metal hardware NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place NIKEs independent contractors and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products Since 1972 Sojitz Corporation of America Sojitz America a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed importexport financing services for us INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the implementation of or potential changes in foreign and domestic trade policies increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political tensions instability conflicts nationalism and terrorism We have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future In recent years uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws Notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for NIKE as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment NIKE also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements Changes in and responses to US trade policies including the imposition of tariffs or penalties on imported goods or retaliatory measures by other countries could negatively affect US corporations including NIKE with business operations andor consumer markets in those countries which could also make it necessary for us to change the way we conduct business either of which may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or our results of operations In addition with respect to proposed trade restrictions we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers domestic economies and the important role they may play in the global economic community Where trade protection measures are implemented we believe we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact However we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA and other antibribery laws applicable to our operations We source a significant portion of our products from and have important consumer 2021 FORM 10K 4 Table of Contents markets outside of the United States and we have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us our employees agents suppliers and other partners COMPETITION The athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas Anta ASICS Li Ning lululemon athletica Puma Under Armour and VF Corporation among others The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences

Deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and globally Reduced consumer demand for our products if consumers seek to reduce or delay discretionary spending in response to the impacts of COVID19 including as a result of a rise in unemployment rates and diminished consumer confidence Cancellation or postponement of sports seasons and sporting events in multiple countries including in the United States and bans on large public gatherings which have reduced consumer spending on our products and could impact the effectiveness of our arrangements with key endorsers Decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures reduced operating hours social distancing restrictions andor changes in consumer behavior The risk that any safety protocols in NIKEowned or affiliated facilities including our offices will not be effective or not be perceived as effective or that any virusrelated illnesses will be linked or alleged to be linked to such facilities whether accurate or not Incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures and compliance with regulatory requirements including providing facial coverings and hand sanitizer rearranging operations to follow social distancing protocols conducting temperature checks COVID19 testing and undertaking regular and thorough disinfecting of surfaces Disruption to our distribution centers and our thirdparty manufacturing partners and other vendors including through the effects of facility closures reductions in operating hours labor shortages and real time changes in operating procedures including for additional cleaning and disinfection procedures Bankruptcies or other financial difficulties facing our wholesale customers which could cause them to be unable to make or delay making payments to us or result in cancellation or reduction of their orders Operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks as a result of continued workforce remote work arrangements and restrictions on employee travel Impacts to our distribution and logistics providers ability to operate or increases in their operating costs These supply chain effects have had an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand including digital demand and have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in an increase in our costs of production and distribution including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses and Significant disruption of and volatility in global financial markets which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future We continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operating financial and tax planning projections including assumptions regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and the global macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic However we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operations and financial condition due to the uncertainty of future developments In particular we believe the ultimate impacts on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on among other things the further spread and duration of COVID19 the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of the illness the availability widespread distribution and acceptance as well as the safety and efficacy of vaccines for COVID19 and the economic impacts of the pandemic Even in those regions where we have experienced business recovery should those regions fail to fully contain COVID19 or suffer a COVID19 relapse those markets may not recover as quickly or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations The pandemic may also affect our business operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks In addition the impact of COVID19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A Risk Factors any of which could have a material effect on us 2021 FORM 10K 11 Table of Contents Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition Our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers Declines in consumer spending have in the past and in the future may result in reduced demand for our products increased inventories reduced orders from retailers for our products order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts and lower gross margins In the future we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so We conduct transactions in various currencies which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US Dollar Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain such as cotton or petroleum derivatives could have a material adverse effect on our costs gross margins and profitability If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products this could result in reduced orders for our products order cancellations late retailer payments extended payment terms higher accounts receivable reduced cash flows greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense If retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty some may become insolvent and cease business operations which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs it may result in delays or nondelivery of shipments of our products Our products services and experiences face intense competition NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products services and experiences The athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies private labels and large companies that have diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products Our NIKE Direct operations both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores also compete with multibrand retailers which sell our products through their digital platforms and physical stores and with digital commerce platforms In addition we compete with respect to the digital services and experiences we are able to offer our consumers including fitness and activity apps sport fitness and wellness content and services and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience Product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service digital commerce platforms digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of intense competition These in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology a reduction in barriers to the creation of new footwear and apparel companies and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment services and experiences constitute significant risk factors in our operations In addition the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers shop and the continued proliferation of digital commerce constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase demand for our products may decline possibly significantly or we may need to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products Economic factors beyond our control and changes in the global economic environment including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which creates exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates Additionally there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union commonly referred to as Brexit or new or proposed US policy changes that impact the US Dollar value relative to other international currencies Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses 2021 FORM 10K 12 Table of Contents could be affected by currency fluctuations specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into US Dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the US Dollar adversely affects the US Dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger US Dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker US Dollar or other trading currency Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the US Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition generally without requiring collateral To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty In the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts retailers may be more cautious with orders A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition In addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products The ongoing financial uncertainty surrounding COVID19 particularly for retailers could also have an effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers manufacturers customers distribution centers offices headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition Moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes wildfires and tsunamis whether occurring in the United States or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues have in the past temporarily disrupted and could in the future disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in and in the future could result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition In particular if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers manufacturers customers distribution centers and vendors are located our continued success would depend in part on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties computer network telecommunication and other systems and operations In addition a natural disaster or severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an adverse impact on consumer spending any of which could in turn result in negative pointofsale trends for our merchandise Further climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters which may affect our business operations either in a particular region or globally as well as the activities of our thirdparty vendors and other suppliers manufacturers and customers In addition the physical changes prompted by climate change could result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences which could in turn affect our business operating results and financial condition We believe the diversity of locations in which we operate our operational size disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks including the Internet and thirdparty services Information Technology Systems position us well but may not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities If we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events we could still experience operational challenges in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel For example our World Headquarters are located in an active seismic zone which is at a higher risk for earthquakes and the related consequences or effects Further if we are unable to find alternative suppliers replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our Information Technology Systems or supply systems we could be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers These events could result in reputational damage lost sales cancellation charges or markdowns all of which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 2021 FORM 10K 13 Table of Contents Business and Operational Risks Failure to maintain our reputation brand image and culture could negatively impact our business Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation Maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation In addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives Our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity purpose and brand culture Negative claims or publicity involving us our culture and values our products services and experiences consumer data or any of our key employees endorsers sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claims are accurate For example while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we do not control their practices Negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand Further our reputation and brand image could be damaged as a result of our support of association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change certain of our activities in response to such considerations Social media which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or by us could also damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations If the reputation culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity then our sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected Our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year Historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters However the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time or in the future as a result of strategic shifts in our business changes in COVID19 related cancellations or postponements and seasonal or geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing cancellation or postponement of significant sporting events such as the NBA Finals Olympics or the World Cup among others In addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice As a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales Accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period This seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions outbreaks of disease social or political unrest availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits Our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner However lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition In addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media mobile applications and online advertising If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 2021 FORM 10K 14 Table of Contents We rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing processes of footwear apparel and equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products Research and development play a key role in technical innovation We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering digital technologies industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cuttingedge performance products While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance and reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence Failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business We establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues as well as other public figures including artists designers and influencers to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers However as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes sports teams and leagues or other public figures or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the high visibility or onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments As a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed Furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected In addition actions taken or statements made by athletes teams or leagues or other endorsers associated with our products or brand that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or endorsers could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition In addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes public figures or sports organizations to use and endorse our products and brand or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability Failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins reduced cash flows and harm to our business To meet anticipated demand for our products we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows Conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages Inventory shortages could delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows from period to period A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties Our NIKE Direct operations including our retail stores and digital platforms have required and will continue to require significant investment Our NIKE Direct stores have required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms Because of their unique design and technological elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores Due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail stores a decline in sales a shift in consumer behavior away from brickandmortar retail or the closure temporary or otherwise or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs Many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond our control pose risks and uncertainties Risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation In addition we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our NIKE Direct operations and our digital offerings will require co ntinued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms In order to deliver highquality digital experiences our digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control We may not be successful 2021 FORM 10K 15 Table of Contents in developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards A growing portion of consumers access our NIKE Direct digital platforms but in the event that it is more difficult for consumers to access and use our digital platforms consumers find that our digital platforms do not effectively meet their needs or expectations or consumers choose not to access or use our digital platforms or use devices that do not offer access to our platforms the success of our NIKE Direct operations could be adversely impacted Our competitors may develop or have already developed digital experiences features content services or technologies that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance We may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment in our NIKE Direct operations and managements attention from our other business opportunities could be diverted which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations If the technologybased systems that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base could be materially adversely affected Many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms Increasingly consumers are using mobilebased devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on mobile platforms We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience Any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable secure userfriendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales harm our reputation with consumers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations In addition as use of our digital platforms continues to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy our consumers needs If we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business We are heavily dependent on Information Technology Systems across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown For example our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems Over a number of years we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate Our work to integrate secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts We cannot provide assurance however that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect our Information Technology Systems and prevent cyberattacks system failures or data or information loss The failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers malware natural disasters vendor business interruptions or other causes failure to properly maintain protect repair or upgrade systems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition In addition the increased use of employeeowned devices for communications as well as workfromhome arrangements such as those implemented in response to the COVID19 pandemic present additional operational risks to our Information Technology Systems including but not limited to increased risks of cyberattacks Further like other companies in the retail industry we have in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience cyberattacks including phishing and other attempts to breach or gain unauthorized access to our systems To date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future We also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans or those of our vendors do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and 2021 FORM 10K 16 Table of Contents profits as well as reputational damage Furthermore we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing digital commerce consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world

could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products The athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores and accelerating digital commerce capabilities The market shares of these retailers may increase through acquisitions and construction of additional stores and investments in digital capacity and as a result of attrition as struggling retailers exit the market Consolidation of our retailers will concentrate our credit risk with a smaller set of retailers any of whom may experience declining sales or a shortage of liquidity including as a result of the COVID19 pandemic In addition increasing market share concentration among a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find sufficient retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses As part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions In addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad As a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products NIKE is supplied by 191 footwear factories located in 14 countries We do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell In fiscal 2021 four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2021 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 61 of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2021 Our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship including due to changes in applicable trade policies or be unable to perform including as a result of the COVID19 pandemic we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations Additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations Certain of our manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product Such manufacturing partners may go out of business if consumer preferences or market conditions change such that there is no longer sufficient demand for the types of products they produce If in the future the relevant products are again in demand and the specialized manufacturers no longer exist we may not be able to locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain products in a timely manner or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations 2021 FORM 10K 17 Table of Contents The market for prime real estate is competitive Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases In addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition Additionally the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition The success of our business depends in part on highquality employees including key personnel as well as our ability to maintain our workplace culture and values Our success depends in part on the continued service of highquality employees including key executive officers and personnel The loss of the services of key individuals or any negative perception with respect to these individuals or our workplace culture or values could harm our business Our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel Changes to our current and future office environments or adoption of a new work model that expects employees to work onsite for a specified number of days with some flexibility to work remotely on other days may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies policies which could negatively impact our ability to attract hire and retain our employees In addition shifts in US immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States W e also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success and we have invested substantial time and resources in building maintaining and evolving our culture Any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success including our ability to retain and recruit employees Our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to United States or foreign employment regulations We have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce including wage and hour laws and regulations fair labor standards minimum wage requirements overtime pay unemployment tax rates workers compensation rates citizenship requirements and payroll taxes which could have a direct impact on our operating costs A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases all of which may cause us to incur additional costs There is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment health and safety wage and hour laws criminal activity personal injury and other claims In addition if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements we could be vulnerable to a strike work stoppage or other labor action which could have an adverse effect on our business Risks Related to Operating a Global Business Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business Virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States Accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political tensions unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products This includes for example the effect of Brexit including implementation of the legal and regulatory framework that applies to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union and other countries as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the United States and elsewhere as further described below under

and tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations Changes in the US presidential administrations import and export policies including trade restrictions increased tariffs or quotas embargoes safeguards or customs restrictions could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations In addition disease outbreaks including the recent COVID19 pandemic terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad These factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure 2021 FORM 10K 18 Table of Contents materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected In addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Furthermore we are subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as the anticorruption laws of other countries in which we operate Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws our employees contractors suppliers and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business reputation and operating results Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing The principal materials used in our apparel products natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place The principal materials used in our footwear products natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather natural and synthetic fabrics and threads nylon canvas and polyurethane films are also locally available to manufacturers Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our independent contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates and other labor standards that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all Further our independent contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages or other changes in labor standards whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals fabrics or raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products In addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner If we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements In addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards Any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm Because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance In addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins Changes in US trade policies including to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect our reputation or results of operations Our success depends on our global distribution facilities We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world Our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities Our distribution facilities have in the past and could be interrupted by information technology problems disasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or government actions taken to mitigate their spread Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business We maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 2021 FORM 10K 19 Table of Contents Legal Regulatory and Compliance Risks We are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations As a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels If we or our employees agents suppliers and other partners fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations such failure could subject us to fines sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations Furthermore laws regulations and policies and the interpretation of such can conflict among jurisdictions and compliance in one jurisdiction may result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction We are involved in various types of claims lawsuits regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business our products and the actions of our employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability antitrust trademark rights and a variety of other matters It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation The global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks such as antibribery anticorruption fraud trade environmental competition privacy and other regulatory matters will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time which could adversely affect us In addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees Changes to US or other countries trade policies and tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations Changes in US or international social political regulatory and economic conditions could impact our business reputation financial condition and results of operations In particular political and economic instability geopolitical conflicts political unrest civil strife terrorist activity acts of war public corruption expropriation nationalism and other economic or political uncertainties in the United States or internationally could interrupt and negatively affect the sale of our products or other business operations Any negative sentiment toward the United States as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business In addition changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business US presidential administrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the US economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the US and other countries where we conduct our business It may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes Changes or proposed changes in US or other countries trade policies may result in restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade Tariffs and other changes in US trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain US goods Further any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the United States or in other countries could affect the trade environment The Company similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the United States and foreign countries including governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or economic sanctions Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the US economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we conduct operations our industry and the global demand for our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business We periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others We also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe their intellectual property rights Defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development manufacturing use importation andor sale of certain products 2021 FORM 10K 20 Table of Contents We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights These actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective For example confidential information related to business strategy innovations new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely inadvertently or improperly used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation loss of intellectual property rights a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions In addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the United States and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we handle transactional and personal information about our wholesale customers and consumers and users of our digital experiences which include online distribution channels and product engagement adaptive products and personal fitness applications Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social engineering such as phishing and largescale complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time Any breach of our or our service providers networks or other vendor systems may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data misappropriation of our consumers users or employees personal information or a disruption of our business Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business including unwanted media attention impairment of our consumer and customer relationships damage to our reputation resulting in lost sales and consumers fines lawsuits or significant legal and remediation expenses We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against respond to andor redress problems caused by any breach In addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous and sometimes conflicting regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States Europe and elsewhere For example the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation the GDPR which became effective on May 25 2018 and California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act the CCPA which became effective on January 1 2020 and additional jurisdictions are considering proposing or adopting similar regulations These laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored Compliance with existing proposed and recently enacted laws including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under GDPR and CCPA and regulations can be costly and time consuming and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others imposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits We could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and as such we are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in any jurisdiction subject to significant change Proposals to reform US and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how US multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the US corporate tax rate Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate income tax expense and cash flows Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are under various tax holidays We also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters These holidays expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met The impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate For example in January 2019 the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company If this matter is adversely resolved the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and the Companys Netherlands income taxes in the future could increase We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service IRS and other tax authorities We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the 2021 FORM 10K 21 Table of Contents applicable final determinations are made For example we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates Failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business We work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit independent parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental human rights health and safety standards for the benefit of workers We also require our contract manufacturers and the contractors of our licensees to comply with applicable standards for product safety Notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors If one or more of our direct or indirect contractors violates or fails to comply with or is accused of violating or failing to comply with such standards and laws this could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition Negative publicity regarding production methods alleged unethical or illegal practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales force us to locate alternative suppliers manufacturers or licenses or result in the imposition of additional regulations including new or additional quotas tariffs sanctions product safety regulations or other regulatory measures by governmental authorities Risks Related to Our Securities Investments and Liquidity Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns From time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses or capabilities product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our NIKE Direct operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention We believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations See also Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock As of June 30 2021 Swoosh LLC beneficially owned approximately 77 of our Class A Common Stock If on June 30 2021 all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 15 The shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the US securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh LLC The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock Swoosh LLC was formed by Philip H Knight our Chairman Emeritus to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock Swoosh LLC is controlled by Mr Knights son and NIKE director Travis Knight Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options Our longterm debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard Poors and Moodys Investors Service If our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for our existing facilities or for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to credit or capital markets could be adversely affected We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to among other things incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments pledge assets as security make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default and as a result the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated In addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt If our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience 2021 FORM 10K 22 Table of Contents difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory reserves contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets hedge accounting for derivatives income taxes and other contingencies Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock Antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock There are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect threequarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number However such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company We may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts opinions of our future performance which may in part be based upon any guidance we have provided Analysts estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline In the past securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities If our stock price is volatile for any reason we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future Any litigation could result in reputational damage substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources needed to successfully run our business 2021 FORM 10K 23 Table of Contents ITEM 1B

sell our products through NIKEowned retail stores and through digital platforms which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses Our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative musthave products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail Since fiscal 2018 through the Consumer Direct Offense and our Triple Double strategy we have focused on doubling the impact of innovation increasing our speed and agility to market and growing our direct connections with consumers In June 2020 we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy Consumer Direct Acceleration This strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas First creating the marketplace of the future through more premium consistent and seamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need This strategy will lead with NIKE Digital and our owned stores as well as through select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision Second we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Mens Womens and Kids This approach is intended to allow us to create product that better meets individual consumer needs including more specialization of our category approach while realigning and simplifying our offense to accelerate our largest growth opportunities In particular we expect to reinvest in our Womens and Kids businesses and also simplify our operating model across the remainder of the Company to optimize effectiveness Third we will unify investments in data and analytics demand sensing insight gathering inventory management and other areas against an endtoend technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally As such our new financial goals through fiscal 2025 are outlined below High singledigit to low doubledigit revenue growth Gross margin rate in the high 40s by fiscal 2025 Earnings before interest and taxes as a percent of revenues EBIT Margin in the high teens by fiscal 2025 Mid to high teens diluted earnings per share growth Exceeding low 30 range rate of return on invested capital ROIC and Annual capital expenditures at roughly 3 of Revenues As a result of our strategic acceleration management announced on July 22 2020 a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up our execution These changes resulted in a net reduction of our global workforce and d uring fiscal 2021 we incurred pretax charges of 294 million which relate to employee termination costs and to a lesser extent stockbased compensation expense All related actions are now substantially complete and w e expect future annual wagerelated savings will be reinvested to execute against this next phase of our strategy For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs see Note 21 Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements COVID19 UPDATE Throughout fiscal 2021 the COVID19 pandemic impacted our business results and operations globally Our business and wholesale partners experienced temporary store closures and stores operating on reduced hours as a result of mandatory lockdowns across our North America EMEA and APLA geographies Additionally disruption in the global supply chain due to container shortages transportation delays and US port congestion interrupted the flow of our inventory Despite the disruption caused by the pandemic we achieved record Revenues for fiscal 2021 which increased 19 to 445 billion compared to the prior fiscal year with gross margin expansion of 140 basis points We ended the fiscal year with Inventories down 7 compared to May 31 2020 and our liquidity position remains strong with 135 billion of Cash and equivalents and Shortterm investments an increase of 47 billion compared to May 31 2020 Our NIKE Direct business fueled our growth throughout the year as we navigated the pandemic leveraging our digital platforms with our store footprint to connect directly with the consumer NIKE Brand digital revenues grew 60 on a currencyneutral basis with strong doubledigit growth across each of our geographies Despite temporary store closures throughout the year due to COVID19 safetyrelated measures we experienced a 4 increase in comparable store sales driven by growth in Greater China and North America partially offset by declines in EMEA and APLA As of July 15 2021 approximately 99 of our owned stores were open with some operating on reduced hours 2021 FORM 10K 28 Table of Contents We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation as well as guidance from international and domestic authorities including federal state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations In these circumstances there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan There remains risk that COVID19 could have material adverse impacts on our future revenue growth as well as our overall profitability and may lead to higher than normal inventory levels in various markets adverse impacts on the global supply

experienced growth of 19 up 17 on a currencyneutral basis driven by increases across all geographies NIKE Direct grew 30 on a currencyneutral basis driven by 60 growth in digital with all geographies growing strong double digits while wholesale revenues grew 10 Revenues for Converse increased 19 and 16 on a reported and currencyneutral basis respecti vely led by strong doubledigit growth in digital Income loss before income taxes increased 131 for fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher revenues gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage NIKE Inc gross margin increased 140 basis points primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID19 including lower factory cancellation charges lower inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments The increase in gross margin also reflects higher fullprice product margins across wholesale and NIKE Direct Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower Demand creation expense partially offset by higher Operating overhead expense Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower marketing and advertising expenses for our brand events and retail operations as well as lower sports marketing expenses as sporting events were postponed due to COVID19 These decreases were partially offset by higher digital marketing investments Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to an increase in strategic technology investments higher NIKE Direct variable costs and 255 million in

financial measure see Use of NonGAAP Financial Measures for further information During fiscal 2020 we entered into definitive agreements to sell our NIKE Brand businesses in Brazil Argentina Chile and Uruguay and to shift to a distributor operating model During fiscal 2021 the transaction with Grupo SBF SA to purchase substantially all of our NIKE Brand operations in Brazil closed Additionally during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 we mutually agreed with Grupo Axo to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the transition of NIKEs businesses in Argentina Chile and Uruguay to a

the entities have remained classified as heldforsale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31 2021 For more information related to our planned distributor partnership transition within APLA see Note 20 Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements In future quarters as we shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor operating model within these countries we expect consolidated NIKE Inc and APLA revenue growth will be reduced due to differences in commercial terms However we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses as well as lessen exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility While foreign currency markets remain volatile in part due to geopolitical dynamics which may lead to a stronger US Dollar we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability We remain committed to effectively managing our business and mitigating financial market risks to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above For discussion

principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of 1 sales to external wholesale customers and 2 internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers Additionally currencyneutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations EBIT is calculated as Net Income before Interest expense income net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income EBIT Margin 2021 FORM 10K 29 Table of Contents is calculated as EBIT divided

NIKE Brand and Converse Higher revenues in North America contributed approximately 7 percentage points to NIKE Inc Revenues with EMEA and Greater China each contributing approximately 4 percentage points of growth and APLA and Converse each contributing approximately 1 percentage point of growth On a currencyneutral basis NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 18 for fiscal 2021 driven by growth in nearly all key categories primarily Sportswear and the Jordan Brand Unit sales of footwear increased 11 while higher average selling price ASP on a wholesale equivalent basis per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth The increase in ASP was primarily due to higher fullprice ASP in part reflecting lower discounts as well as higher NIKE Direct ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business Currencyneutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 15 for fiscal 2021 due to growth in all key categories primarily Sportswear Football Soccer and the Jordan Brand Unit sales of apparel increased 14 while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth The increase in ASP was primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business as well as higher NIKE Direct ASP partially offset by lower fullprice ASP On a reported basis NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 39 of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2021 compared to 35 for fiscal 2020 Digital commerce sales were 91 billion for fiscal 2021 compared to 55 billion for fiscal 2020 On a currencyneutral basis NIKE Direct revenues increased 30 for fiscal 2021 driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 60 comparable store sales growth of 4 and the addition of new stores

been open at least one year 2 square footage has not changed by more than 15 within the past year and 3 the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID19 Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKEowned inline and factory stores Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry As a result our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies On a currencyneutral basis fiscal 2021 NIKE Brand Mens and Womens revenues increased 11 and 20 respectively Higher NIKE Brand Mens revenues were driven by growth in nearly all key categories primarily

our consolidated gross profit increased 23 to 19962 million compared to 16241 million for fiscal 2020 as the prior fiscal year was significantly impacted by lower shipments to our wholesale customers and store closures within our NIKE Direct operations due to COVID19 Gross margin increased 140 basis points to 448 for fiscal 2021 compared to 434 for fiscal 2020 due to the following Wholesale equivalent Favorable NIKE Brand fullprice product margins across both our wholesale and NIKE Direct businesses primarily reflect higher fullprice ASP net of discounts Additionally the favorable impact of growth in our higher margin NIKE Direct business led by NIKE owned Digital was more than offset by higher promotions in our factory stores during the first half of fiscal 2021 to reduce excess inventory as a result of COVID19 Lower other costs are due to annualizing certain impacts of COVID19 from fiscal 2020 including lower factory cancellation charges lower inventory obsolescence reserves

transition within APLA see Note 20 Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign

meaningful shift in the way consumers shop for product and make purchasing decisions across each of our geographies Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product and have an expectation for superior service and rapid delivery all fueled by the shift toward digital and monobrand experiences in NIKE Direct We anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels Specifically in North America we remain focused on building longterm momentum with our strategic wholesale customers which offer a differentiated retail experience Additionally over the last three years we have significantly reduced the number of undifferentiated wholesale accounts During fiscal 2021 we took further steps towards account and channel consolidation by reprioritizing product allocation to benefit NIKE Direct and our differentiated strategic wholesale customers We expect that over the next two fiscal years we will more aggressively accelerate these changes as we work to reprofile the shape of the marketplace and recapture wholesale revenue declines over time FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 On a

segment results For more information see Note 20 Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 On a currencyneutral basis APLA revenues increased 8 for fiscal 2021 The increase was due to higher revenues across most territories led by a 15 increase in Japan a 37 increase in Pacific which includes Australia and New Zealand and a 12 increase in Korea partially offset by a decline in Latin Distributors of 48 Additionally the transition of our NIKE Brand business in Brazil to a thirdparty distributor operating model reduced APLA revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points Revenues increased in most key categories led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand NIKE Direct revenues increased 22 primarily fueled by strong digital sales growth of 73 partially offset by comparable store sales declines of 4 largely due to reduced physical retail traffic in part resulting from safetyrelated measures in response to COVID19 Currencyneutral footwear revenues increased 8 for fiscal 2021 due to higher revenues in several key categories primarily the Jordan Brand and Sportswear Unit sales of footwear decreased 5 while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 13 percentage points of footwear revenue growth driven by higher fullprice and NIKE Direct ASPs in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory which includes Argentina Chile and Uruguay as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business Currencyneutral apparel revenues increased 10 for fiscal 2021 due to higher revenues in most key categories led by Sportswear Unit sales of apparel increased 5 while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth Higher ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher fullprice ASP in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory Reported EBIT increased 29 for fiscal 2021 driven by higher revenues lower selling and administrative expense and gross margin expansion Gross margin increased approximately 130 basis points as higher fullprice ASP net of discounts in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory and lower other costs were partially offset by higher product costs unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and lower margin in our NIKE Direct business The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID19 including lower factory cancellation charges and lower inventory obsolescence reserves Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation and operating overhead expense The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing expense as well as a decline in sports marketing costs Lower operating overhead expense was primarily due to lower bad debt and travel and related costs partially offset by higher NIKE Direct variable

Revenues 40 11 7 Earnings Loss Before Interest and Taxes 2261 1967 15 1810 9 Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program The Corporate loss before interest and taxes primarily consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses including expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters unallocated insurance benefit and compensation programs including stockbased compensation and certain foreign currency gains and losses In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard rates used to record nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse related foreign currency hedge results conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 Corporates loss before interest and taxes increased 294 million during fiscal 2021 primarily due to the following an unfavorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of 241 million related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments reported as a component of consolidated Other income expense net a favorable change of 132 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse net of hedge gains and losses these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin and an unfavorable change of 185 million in part due to restructuringrelated costs of 294 million associated with changes to our organizational model announced in July 2020 partially offset by the 405 million charge in the prior year related to our planned distributor transition within APLA For more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA as well as more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs refer to Note 20 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 21 Restructuring respectively within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES OVERVIEW As a global company with significant operations outside the United States in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into US Dollars Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE Inc We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options As described below the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company NTC and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end 2021 FORM 10K 42 Table of Contents TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are Product Costs NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways 1 Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity a Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from thirdparty factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC b Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from thirdparty factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar In both purchasing scenarios a weaker US Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger US Dollar increases its cost 2 Factory input costs NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures Under this program our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a thirdparty All currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other income expense net Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating US Dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening US Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKEs US Dollar inventory cost Conversely a weakening US Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost NonFunctional Currency Denominated External Sales A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro eg the British Pound but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency These sales generate a foreign currency exposure Other Costs Nonfunctional currency denominated costs such as endorsement contracts also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent In certain cases the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other income expense net Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail NonFunctional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables including intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other income expense net within our consolidated results of operations MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above Generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements 2021 FORM 10K 43 Table of Contents Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments Accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other income expense net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the US Dollar Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into US Dollars for consolidated reporting The translation of foreign subsidiaries nonUS Dollar denominated balance sheets into US Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income loss within Shareholders equity In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income a weaker US Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger US Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately 893 million a detriment of approximately 867 million and a detriment of approximately 1236 million for the years ended May 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a benefit of approximately 260 million a detriment of approximately 212 million and a detriment of approximately 233 million for the years ended May 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively Management generally identifies hyperinflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a threeyear period exceeds 100 Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyperinflationary market As a result beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the US Dollar As of and for the period ended May 31 2021 this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into US Dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these US Dollar denominated investments at nonUS Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under US GAAP We utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these US Dollar investments The combination of the purchase and sale of the US Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold Hedges of the purchase of US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other income expense net had a favorable impact of approximately 19 million and unfavorable impacts of 91 million and 97 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the US Dollar which could adversely impact the US Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings We have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with US GAAP There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2021 and 2020 There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31 2021 2020 and 2019 2021 FORM 10K 44 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW ACTIVITY Cash provided used by operations was an inflow of 6657 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 2485 million for fiscal 2020 Net income adjusted for noncash items generated 6612 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2021 compared to 3730 million for fiscal 2020 The increase primarily reflects the recovery of our business operations from the impact of COVID19 The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided used by operations of 45 million for fiscal 2021 compared to a decrease of 1245 million for fiscal 2020 The net change in working capital was impacted by a 2361 million decrease in Inventories driven by strong consumer demand as we return to healthy inventory levels across markets closed in the prior year due to COVID19 An increase in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities also contributed to the net change in working capital primarily due to reduced spending in fiscal 2020 as a result of COVID19 In addition the net change in working capital was impacted by a 2845 million increase in Accounts receivable net primarily driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 Cash provided used by investing activities was an outflow of 3800 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an outflow of 1028 million for fiscal 2020 primarily driven by higher purchases of shortterm investments During fiscal 2021 the net change in investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash outflow of 3276 million compared to a cash inflow of 27 million in fiscal 2020 Additionally during fiscal 2021 we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth specifically focused around digital capabilities our endtoend technology foundation our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain In future periods we expect to make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3 of annual revenues Cash provided used by financing activities was an outflow of 1459 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an inflow of 2491 million for fiscal 2020 This change was primarily due to the net proceeds from a 5942 million corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 partially offset by lower share repurchases during fiscal 2021 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID19 we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existing share repurchase program The existing program remained authorized by the Board of Directors and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we began repurchasing shares under the program In fiscal 2021 we purchased 49 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for 650 million an average price of 13354 per share under the fouryear 15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018 As of May 31 2021 we had repurchased 500 million shares at a cost of 4669 million an average price of 9333 per share under this program We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions CAPITAL RESOURCES On July 23 2019 we filed a shelf registration statement the Shelf with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time The Shelf expires on July 23 2022 On August 16 2019 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings up to 3 billion in total upon lender approval The facility matures on August 16 2024 with a oneyear extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond August 16 2026 This facility replaces the prior 2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on August 28 2015 which would have matured August 28 2020 On March 15 2021 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings up to 15 billion in total upon lender approval The facility matures on March 14 2022 with a 364day extension option up to 30 days prior to the existing termination date provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond March 13 2023 This facility replaces the prior 2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on April 6 2020 which would have matured on April 5 2021 As of May 31 2021 and 2020 no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities Refer to Note 7 ShortTerm Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information We currently have longterm debt ratings of AA and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on August 16 2019 and March 15 2021 if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fees and interest rates would increase Conversely if our longterm debt ratings were to improve the facility fees and interest rates would decrease Changes in our longterm debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities Under these facilities we have agreed to various covenants These covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become 2021 FORM 10K 45 Table of Contents immediately due and payable As of May 31 2021 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future Liquidity was also provided by our 3 billion commercial paper program which we decreased from 4 billion in connection with the new credit facility agreement entered into on March 15 2021 as described above During the fiscal year ended May 31 2021 the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was 248 million No commercial paper was outstanding as of May 31 2021 As of May 31 2020 we had 248 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 165 We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs We currently have shortterm debt ratings of A1 and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets however future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets As of May 31 2021 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 135 billion primarily consisting of commercial paper corporate notes deposits held at major banks money market funds US government sponsored enterprise obligations US Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities Our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk While individual securities have varying durations as of May 31 2021 the weightedaverage days to maturity of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 54 days We believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed We indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings Should we require additional capital in the United States we may determine to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt Given our existing structure if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor Currently we have several such agreements in place Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our significant longterm contractual obligations as of May 31 2021 and

Table of Contents In addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives In addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 3 We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms In some cases prices are subject to change throughout the production process 4 Other purchase obligations primarily include construction service and marketing

that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements We believe the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements so we consider these to be our

estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies Within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported REVENUE RECOGNITION Beginning in fiscal 2019 we adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU No 201409 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 Our revenue recognition policies under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear apparel and equipment as well as Converse products comprise a single performance obligation which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred based on the terms of sale A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive 2021 FORM 10K 47 Table of Contents substantially all of the benefits of the product Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions As part of our revenue recognition policy consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against Revenues with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns Provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date Estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded If actual or expected future returns discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made Refer also to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16 Revenues for additional information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements INVENTORY RESERVES We make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS A significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts In general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract However certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year When we determine payments are probable the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance In these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which we record in Cost of sales as the related sales occur For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITELIVED ASSETS We review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset 2021 FORM 10K 48 Table of Contents group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss rather than Net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income In most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions By their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions When the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss to Other income expense net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs In rare circumstances the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence INCOME TAXES We are subject to taxation in the United States as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws On an interim basis we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate Income tax expense The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur As the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year When this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary Realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain At least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made We have not recorded withholding tax expense for foreign earnings we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested within certain of our foreign jurisdictions The amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore is due to the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore operations and our expectations of the future cash needs of our US and foreign entities Withholding tax consequences are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation Despite this approach because the determination is based on expected working capital and other capital needs in jurisdictions where the earnings are generated the possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated For instance the actual cash needs of our US operations may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations This would result in additional withholding tax expense in the year we determined amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore On a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information 2021 FORM 10K 49 Table of Contents OTHER CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 2021 FORM 10K 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions We have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements The timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31 2021 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for EuroUS Dollar British PoundEuro Chinese YuanUS Dollar and Japanese YenUS Dollar currency pairs Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs To achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT We monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and ValueatRisk VaR Our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies and fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only The VaR determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variancecovariance technique These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding oneyear period The value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors The estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the VaR model was 92 million and 48 million as of May 31 2021 and 2020 respectively The VaR increased yearoveryear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31 2021 Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 184 million and 126 million during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively 2021 FORM 10K 51 Table of Contents The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies and fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation Furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the VaR calculation above Therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows Details of

maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB We conducted our audits in accordance with

Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that i relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and ii involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matter below providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates Accounting for Income Taxes As described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements the Company recorded income tax expense of 934 million for the year ended May 31 2021 and has net deferred tax assets of 1133 million including a valuation allowance of 12 million and total gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding related interest and penalties of 896 million as of May 31 2021 609 million of which would affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognized in future periods The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings Management assesses the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization A valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset to the extent that recovery is not likely The Company is subject to taxation in the United States as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions As disclosed by management the use of significant judgment and estimates as well as the interpretation and application of complex tax laws is required by management to determine the Companys provision for income taxes The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for income taxes is a critical audit matter are the high degree of auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to i managements assessment of complex tax laws and regulations including recent court rulings as it relates to determining the provision for income taxes and other tax positions and ii managements assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets specifically around future taxable income foreign tax credit utilization and available tax planning strategies In addition the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge Addressing the matters involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the provision for income taxes and other tax positions including controls over managements assessments of the realizability of deferred tax assets These procedures also included among others evaluating the effect on the Companys tax provision of changes in its legal entity structure evaluating changes in and compliance with tax laws and testing managements tax calculations including the Companys forecast of future taxable income tax planning strategies and foreign tax credit utilization of deferred tax assets Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the application of relevant tax laws the provision for income taxes and the reasonableness of managements assessments of whether certain tax positions are morelikelythannot of being sustained s

include the accounts of NIKE Inc and its subsidiaries the Company or NIKE All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated REVENUE RECOGNITION Beginning in fiscal 2019 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU No 201409 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 The Companys revenue recognition policies under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear apparel and equipment as well as Converse products comprise a single performance obligation which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred based on the terms of sale A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions Consideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through salesbased or usagebased royalty arrangements and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction and are collected by the Company from a customer are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues are recognized SALESRELATED RESERVES Consideration promised in the Companys contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns Provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date 2021 FORM 10K 63 Table of Contents Estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded If actual or expected future returns discounts or claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves established a reduction or increase to net Revenues is recorded in the period in which such determination is made COST OF SALES Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs as well as warehousing costs including the cost of warehouse labor thirdparty royalties certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs including costs of endorsement contracts complimentary products television digital and print advertising and media costs brand events and retail brand presentation Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run Advertising media costs are expensed when the advertisement appears Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is complete and delivered A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts In general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract However certain contracts contain elements that may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport eg winning a championship The Company records Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year When the Company determines payments are probable the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Companys best estimate of the endorsers performance In these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the Companys estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which the Company records in Cost of sales as the related sales occur For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense Through cooperative advertising programs the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products The Company records these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time it is obligated to its customers for the costs This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run Total advertising and promotion expenses which the Company refers to as Demand creation expense were 3114 million 3592 million and 3753 million for the years ended May 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled 630 million and 686 million at May 31 2021 and 2020 respectively of which 338 million and 326 million respectively were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and 292 million and 360 million respectively were recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applied OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE Operating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefitrelated expenses research and development costs bad debt expense as well as other administrative expenses such as rent depreciation and amortization professional services meetings and travel 2021 FORM 10K 64 Table of Contents CASH AND EQUIVALENTS Cash and equivalents represent cash and shortterm highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates including commercial paper US Treasury US Agency money market funds time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase SHORTTERM INVESTMENTS Shortterm investments consist of highly liquid investments including commercial paper US Treasury US Agency time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase At May 31 2021 and 2020 Shortterm investments consisted of availableforsale debt securities which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of tax in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss unless unrealized losses are determined to be unrecoverable Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification The Company considers all availableforsale debt securities including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within Shortterm investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys Shortterm investments ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable net consist primarily of amounts due from customers The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations the Company considers historical levels of credit losses as well as macroeconomic and industry trends such as the impacts of COVID19 to determine the amount of the allowance Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered noncurrent and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was 93 million and 214 million as of May 31 2021 and 2020 respectively INVENTORY VALUATION Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis In some instances the Company ships products directly from its suppliers to the customer with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Companys suppliers as well as inbound freight import duties taxes insurance logistics and other handling fees PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION Property plant and equipment are recorded at cost Depreciation is determined on a straightline basis for land improvements buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 12 year period on a straightline basis The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software The Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities training maintenance and all other postimplementation stage activities are expensed as incurred Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers In most instances the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established therefore software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred 2021 FORM 10K 65 Table of Contents IMPAIRMENT OF LONGLIVED ASSETS The Company reviews the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value GOODWILL AND INDEFINITELIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment the Company allocates goodwill across its reporting units which are considered the Companys operating segments The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount an impairment test is unnecessary If an impairment test is necessary the Company will estimate the fair value of its related reporting units If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value Indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the Company determines it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets the Company primarily utilizes the relieffromroyalty method This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenues for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital If the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible exceeds its fair value the asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value OPERATING LEASES Beginning in fiscal 2020 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU No 201602 Leases Topic 842 Periods prior to fiscal 2020 have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with the Companys historical accounting policies The Companys lease recognition policies under Topic 842 are described in the following paragraphs The Company primarily leases retail store space certain distribution and warehouse facilities office space equipment and other nonreal estate assets The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at the commencement date which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the asset Lease components are not separated from nonlease components for real estate leases within the Companys lease portfolio Rightofuse ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term with lease expense recognized on a straightline basis The Companys incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable Lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses renewal or termination options rent holidays or certain landlord incentives including tenant improvement allowances ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced by the amount of lease incentives The lease term includes the noncancelable period of the lease and options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options The Company does not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes related lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straightline basis over the lease term Certain lease agreements include variable lease 2021 FORM 10K 66 Table of Contents payments which are based on a percent of retail sales over specified levels or adjust periodically for inflation as a result of changes in a published index primarily the Consumer Price Index and are expensed as incurred FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives equity securities and availableforsale debt securities Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date The Company uses a threelevel hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques market approach income approach and cost approach The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active Level 3 Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing Observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates forward pricing curves currency volatilities currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties The Companys fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for additional information FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into US Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income loss in Total shareholders equity The Companys global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement the impact of which is recorded in Other income expense net within the Consolidated Statements of Income ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of Total shareholders equity Longterm debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and if designated the extent to which the hedge is effective The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For designated net investment hedges this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For the Companys fair value hedges which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives 2021 FORM 10K 67 Table of Contents STOCKBASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value net of estimated forfeitures of equity awards and recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense as applicable in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straightline basis over the vesting period Substantially all awards vest ratably over four years of continued employment with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant The fair value of options stock appreciation rights and employees purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans ESPPs is determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant Refer to Note 11 Common Stock and StockBased Compensation for additional information on the Companys stockbased compensation programs INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain At least quarterly the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies The Company uses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization which are inherently uncertain and can result in significant variation between estimated and actual results To the extent the Company believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset which increases the Companys income tax expense in the period when such determination is made The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes for further discussion EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards Refer to Note 12 Earnings Per Share for further discussion MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ from these estimates Additionally the extent to which the evolving COVID19 pandemic impacts the Companys financial statements will depend on a number of factors including the magnitude and duration of the pandemic There remains risk that COVID19 could have a material adverse impact on future revenue growth as well as overall profitability and may lead to higher than normal inventory levels in various markets adverse impacts on the global supply chain revised payment terms with certain wholesale customers higher salesrelated reserves factory cancellation costs and a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across the Companys jurisdictions RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In October 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201616 Income Taxes Topic 740 IntraEntity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory The updated guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs Income tax effects of intraentity transfers of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party The Company adopted the standard on June 1 2018 using a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of applying the new standard recognized in Retained earnings at the date of adoption The adoption resulted in reductions to Retained earnings Deferred income taxes and other assets and Prepaid 2021 FORM 10K 68 Table of Contents expenses and other current assets of 507 million 422 million

All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedge instruments are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction Effective hedge results are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure When it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period hedge accounting is discontinued and the Company accounts for the associated derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below Additionally the gains and losses associated with derivatives no longer designated as cash flow hedge instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss are recognized immediately in Other income expense net if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional twomonth period thereafter In rare circumstances the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company The purpose of the Companys foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Companys consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costs nonfunctional currency denominated revenues intercompany revenues demand creation expenses investments in US Dollar denominated availableforsale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions Product cost foreign currency exposures are primarily generated through nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below NIKE entities primarily purchase product in two ways 1 Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different 2021 FORM 10K 82 Table of Contents functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC 2 Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to the Companys existing foreign currency exposures Under this program the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges For all currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was 174 billion as of May 31 2021 As of May 31 2021 approximately 369 million of deferred net losses net of tax on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature As of May 31 2021 the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months FAIR VALUE HEDGES The Company has in the past been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31 2021 NET INVESTMENT HEDGES The Company has in the past hedged and may in the future hedge the risk of variability in foreign currencydenominated net investments in whollyowned international operations All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2021 UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets andor embedded derivative contracts These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other income expense net together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position andor embedded derivative contract The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was 48 billion as of May 31 2021 EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES As part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the US Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory In addition embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other income expense net through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist As of May 31 2021 the total notional amount of embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately 415 million 2021 FORM 10K 83 Table of Contents CREDIT RISK The Company is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings however this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted To manage this risk the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored The Companys derivative contracts contain credit riskrelated contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business The Companys bilateral creditrelated contingent features generally require the owing entity either the Company or the derivative counterparty to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of 50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than 50 million Additionally a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral requirements As of May 31 2021 the Company was in compliance with all credit riskrelated contingent features and derivative instruments with such features were in a net liability position of approximately 364 million Accordingly the Company posted 39 million of cash collateral as a result of these contingent features Further as of May 31 2021 the Company had received no cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial For additional information related to the
