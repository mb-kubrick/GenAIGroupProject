Part I Item 1 Business RECENT DEVELOPMENTS During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023 we completed the sale of our entity in Chile and our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to thirdparty distributors respectively Now that we have completed the shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor model within our Central and South America CASA territory we expect consolidated NIKE Inc and Asia Pacific Latin America APLA revenue growth will be reduced due to different commercial terms However over time we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses as well as reduce exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility USE OF NONGAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10K we discuss nonGAAP financial measures which should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP References to these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies Management uses these nonGAAP measures when evaluating the Companys performance including when making financial and operating

revenues enhance visibility to underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations Currencyneutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period in place of the exchange rates in use during the current period Wholesale equivalent revenues References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of 1 sales to external wholesale customers and 2 internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers COMPARABLE STORE SALES Comparable store sales This key metric which excludes NIKE Brand Digital sales comprises revenues from NIKEowned inline and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met 1 the store has been open at least one year 2 square footage has not changed by more than 15 within the past year and 3 the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID19 Comparable store sales represents a performance metric that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKEowned inline and factory stores Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry As a result our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies 2023 FORM 10K 30 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Dollars in millions except per share data FISCAL 2023 FISCAL 2022 CHANGE FISCAL 2021 CHANGE Revenues

10 and 16 compared to fiscal 2022 on a reported and currencyneutral basis respectively The increase was due to higher revenues in North America Europe Middle East Africa EMEA APLA and Greater China which contributed approximately 7 6 2 and 1 percentage points to NIKE Inc Revenues respectively NIKE Brand revenues which represented over 90 of NIKE Inc Revenues increased 10 and 16 on a reported and currencyneutral basis respectively This increase was primarily due to higher revenues in Mens the Jordan Brand Womens and Kids which grew 17 3511 and 10 respectively on a wholesale equivalent basis NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 20 on a currencyneutral basis due to higher revenues in Mens the Jordan Brand Womens and Kids Unit sales of footwear increased 13 while higher average selling price ASP per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth Higher ASP was primarily due to higher fullprice ASP net of discounts on a wholesale equivalent basis and growth in the size of our NIKE Direct business partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 8 on a currencyneutral basis primarily due to higher revenues in Mens Unit sales of apparel increased 4 while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth Higher ASP was primarily due to higher fullprice ASP and growth in the size of our NIKE Direct business partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP reflecting higher promotional activity NIKE Direct revenues increased 14 from 187 billion in fiscal 2022 to 213 billion in fiscal 2023 On a currencyneutral basis NIKE Direct revenues increased 20 primarily driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 24 comparable store sales growth of 14 and the addition of new stores

fiscal 2022 Gross margin decreased 250 basis points to 435 for fiscal 2023 compared to 460 for fiscal 2022 due to the following Wholesale equivalent The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to Higher NIKE Brand product costs on a wholesale equivalent basis primarily due to higher input costs and elevated inbound freight and logistics costs as well as product mix Lower margin in our NIKE Direct business driven by higher promotional activity to liquidate inventory in the current period compared to lower promotional activity in the prior period resulting from lower available inventory supply Unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates including hedges and Lower offprice margin on a wholesale equivalent basis This was partially offset by Higher NIKE Brand fullprice ASP net of discounts on a wholesale equivalent basis due primarily to strategic pricing actions and product mix and Lower other costs primarily due to higher inventory

Other income expense net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonoperating transactions that are outside the normal course of business FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2022 Other income expense net increased from 181 million of other income net in fiscal 2022 to 280 million in the current fiscal year primarily due to a net favorable change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses including hedges and the onetime charge related to the deconsolidation of our Russian operations recognized in the prior year This increase was partially offset by net unfavorable activity related to our strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA including the loss recognized upon the completion of the sale of our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a thirdparty distributor in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 For more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA see Note 18 Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign

to decreased benefits from stockbased compensation and a noncash onetime benefit in the prior year related to the onshoring of certain nonUS intangible property ownership rights On August 16 2022 the US government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that includes among other provisions changes to the US corporate income tax system including a fifteen percent minimum tax based on adjusted

expenses including expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters unallocated insurance benefit and compensation programs including stockbased compensation and certain foreign currency gains and losses In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard rates used to record nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse related foreign currency hedge results conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2022 Corporates loss before interest and taxes increased 621 million during fiscal 2023 primarily due to the following an unfavorable change of 371 million primarily related to higher wage and other professional services expenses reported as a component of consolidated Operating overhead expense an unfavorable change of 352 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse net of hedge gains and losses these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin an unfavorable change of 45 million largely due to net unfavorable activity related to our strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA including the loss recognized upon completion of the sale our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a thirdparty distributor in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 This was partially offset by the onetime charge related to the deconsolidation of our Russian operations recognized in the prior year with the net amount of these activities reported as a component of consolidated Other income expense net and a favorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of 174 million related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments reported as a component of consolidated Other income expense net FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES OVERVIEW As a global company with significant operations outside the United States in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into US Dollars Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE Inc We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options As described below the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company NTC and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 2023 FORM 10K 42 Table of Contents Refer to Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Note 12 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are Product Costs NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways 1 Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity a Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from thirdparty factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC b Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from thirdparty factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar In both purchasing scenarios a weaker US Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger US Dollar increases its cost 2 Factory input costs NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures Under this program our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating US Dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening US Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKEs US Dollar inventory cost Conversely a weakening US Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost NonFunctional Currency Denominated External Sales A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro eg the British Pound but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency These sales generate a foreign currency exposure Other Costs Nonfunctional currency denominated costs such as endorsement contracts also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent NonFunctional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables including intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other income expense net within our Consolidated Statements of Income MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above Generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges 2023 FORM 10K 43 Table of Contents Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not formally designated as hedging instruments Accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other income expense net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability being hedged TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the US Dollar Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into US Dollars for consolidated reporting The translation of foreign subsidiaries nonUS Dollar denominated balance sheets into US Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income loss within Shareholders equity In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income a weaker US Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger US Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately 2859 million 295 million and a benefit of approximately 893 million for the years ended May 31 2023 2022 and 2021 respectively The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately 824 million 87 million and a benefit of approximately 260 million for the years ended May 31 2023 2022 and 2021 respectively MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into US Dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these US Dollar denominated investments at nonUS Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America US GAAP We utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these US Dollar investments The combination of the purchase and sale of the US Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold Hedges of the purchase of US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other income expense net had an unfavorable impact of approximately 1023 million and a favorable impact of approximately 132 million and 19 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31 2023 2022 and 2021 respectively NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the US Dollar which could adversely impact the US Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings We have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with US GAAP There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2023 and 2022 There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31 2023 2022 and 2021 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW ACTIVITY Cash provided used by operations was an inflow of 5841 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 5188 million for fiscal 2022 Net income adjusted for noncash items generated 6354 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2023 compared to 6848 million for fiscal 2022 The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided used by operations of 513 million for fiscal 2023 compared to a decrease of 1660 million for fiscal 2022 For fiscal 2023 the net change in working capital compared to the prior year was impacted by unfavorable changes in Accounts payable offset by favorable impacts from Inventories and Accounts receivable These changes were in part due to reduced inventory purchases in the current period and timing of wholesale shipments Further impacting these changes was a lower available supply of inventory in the prior year due to supply chain constraints Cash provided used by investing activities was an inflow of 564 million for fiscal 2023 compared to an outflow of 1524 million for fiscal 2022 primarily driven by the net change in shortterm investments For fiscal 2023 the net change in shortterm 2023 FORM 10K 44 Table of Contents investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash inflow of 1481 million compared to a cash outflow of 747 million for fiscal 2022 Additionally we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support future growth specifically focused around digital capabilities our endtoend technology foundation our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain Cash provided used by financing activities was an outflow of 7447 million for fiscal 2023 compared to an outflow of 4836 million for fiscal 2022 The increased outflow in fiscal 2023 was driven by higher share repurchases of 5480 million for fiscal 2023 compared to 4014 million for fiscal 2022 the repayment of 500 million of senior notes that matured in fiscal 2023 as well as lower proceeds from stock option exercises which resulted in a cash inflow of 651 million in fiscal 2023 compared to 1151 million in fiscal 2022 In fiscal 2023 we purchased a total of 500 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for 55 billion an average price of 11032 per share In August 2022 we terminated the previous fouryear 15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018 Under this program we repurchased 65 million shares for a total approximate cost of 7100 million an average price of 10985 per share during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 838 million shares for a total approximate cost of 94 billion an average price of 11182 per share during the term of the program Upon termination of the fouryear 15 billion program we began purchasing shares under the new fouryear 18 billion share repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2022 As of May 31 2023 we had repurchased 435 million shares at a cost of approximately 48 billion an average price of 11038 per share under this new program We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions CAPITAL RESOURCES On July 21 2022 we filed a shelf registration statement the Shelf with the US Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time The Shelf expires on July 21 2025 On March 11 2022 we entered into a fiveyear committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings up to 3 billion in total with lender approval The facility matures on March 11 2027 with options to extend the maturity date up to an additional two years This facility replaces the prior 2 billion fiveyear credit facility agreement entered into on August 16 2019 which would have matured on August 16 2024 Refer to Note 5 ShortTerm Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information On March 10 2023 we entered into a 364day committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings up to 15 billion in total with lender approval The facility matures on March 8 2024 with an option to extend the maturity date by 364 days This facility replaces the prior 1 billion 364day credit facility agreement entered into on March 11 2022 which matured on March 10 2023 Refer to Note 5 ShortTerm Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information We currently have longterm debt ratings of AA and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on March 11 2022 and March 10 2023 if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fees and interest rates would increase Conversely if our longterm debt ratings were to improve the facility fees and interest rates would decrease Changes in our longterm debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities Under these facilities we have agreed to various covenants These covenants include limits on the disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the applicable syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable As of May 31 2023 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and we believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future Liquidity is also provided by our 3 billion commercial paper program As of and for the fiscal years ended May 31 2023 and 2022 we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our 3 billion program We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the capital or credit markets however future volatility may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets As of May 31 2023 we had Cash and equivalents and Shortterm investments totaling 107 billion primarily consisting of commercial paper corporate notes deposits held at major banks money market funds US Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities Our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk While individual securities have varying durations as of May 31 2023 the weightedaverage days to maturity of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 98 days 2023 FORM 10K 45 Table of Contents We believe that existing Cash and equivalents Shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future Our material cash requirements as of May 31 2023 were as follows Debt Obligations Refer to Note 5 ShortTerm Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 6 LongTerm Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information Operating Leases Refer to Note 17 Leases in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information Endorsement Contracts As of May 31 2023 we had endorsement contract obligations of 76 billion with 13 billion payable within 12 months representing approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete public figure sport team and league endorsers of our products Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than these amounts as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements andor royalties on product sales in future periods Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods In addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors and the contracts generally do not stipulate a minimum amount of cash to be spent on the product Product Purchase Obligations As of May 31 2023 we had product purchase obligations of 64 billion all of which are payable within the next 12 months Product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations In some cases prices are subject to change throughout the production process Other Purchase Obligations As of May 31 2023 we had 33 billion of other purchase obligations with 17 billion payable within the next 12 months Other purchase obligations primarily include technology investments construction service and marketing commitments including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts made in the ordinary course of business The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms and may include open purchase orders for nonproduct purchases In addition to the above we have longterm obligations for uncertain tax positions and various postretirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes and Note 11 Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and postretirement benefits respectively As a part of the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as of May 31 2023 we had 644 million in estimated future cash payments with 161 million payable within the next 12 months These amounts represent the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are reflected net of foreign tax credits we utilized Refer to Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our offbalance sheet arrangements bank guarantees and letters of credit OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS As of May 31 2023 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our current and future financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources In connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor Currently we have several such agreements in place Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and issued accounting standards 2023 FORM 10K 46 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements We believe the assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting estimates described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Finance Committee of the Board of Directors Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements Within the context of these critical accounting estimates we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported SALESRELATED RESERVES Provisions for anticipated sales returns consist of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns Provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date Estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded If actual or expected future returns discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made Refer to Note 14 Revenues in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information INVENTORY RESERVES We make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss rather than Net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income In most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions By their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions When the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss to Other income expense net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs In rare circumstances the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence Refer to Note 12 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information 2023 FORM 10K 47 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES We are subject to taxation in the United States as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws On an interim basis we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate Income tax expense The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur As the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year When this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs On a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information OTHER CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and government investigations related to our business products and actions of our employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability antitrust customs tax intellectual property and other matters We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability Refer to Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information 2023 FORM 10K 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements The timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31 2023 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for EuroUS Dollar British PoundEuro Chinese YuanUS Dollar and Japanese YenUS Dollar currency pairs Refer to Note 12 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs To achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT We monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and ValueatRisk VaR Our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies and fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only The VaR determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variancecovariance technique These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding oneyear period The value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors The estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the VaR model was 111 million and 99 million as of May 31 2023 and 2022 respectively The VaR increased yearoveryear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31 2023 Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 289 million and 170 million during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 respectively The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies and fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation Furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward 2023 FORM 10K 49 Table of Contents

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE Inc and its subsidiaries the Company or NIKE All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear apparel and equipment as well as Converse products comprise a single performance obligation which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred based on the terms of sale A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions Consideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through salesbased or usagebased royalty arrangements and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction and are collected by the Company from a customer are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues are recognized SALESRELATED RESERVES Consideration promised in the Companys contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns Provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date Estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded If actual or expected future returns discounts or claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves established a reduction or increase to net Revenues is recorded in the period in which such determination is made 2023 FORM 10K 61 Table of Contents COST OF SALES Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs as well as warehousing costs including the cost of warehouse labor thirdparty royalties certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs including costs of endorsement contracts complimentary products television digital and print advertising as well as media costs brand events and retail brand presentation Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run Advertising media costs are expensed when the advertisement appears Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is complete and delivered A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts In general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract However certain contracts contain elements that may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport eg winning a championship The Company records Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year When the Company determines payments are probable the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Companys best estimate of the endorsers performance In these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the Companys estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which the Company records in Cost of sales as the related sales occur For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense Through cooperative advertising programs the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products To the extent the Company receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration paid to the customer that does not exceed the fair value of that good or service the amounts reimbursed are recorded in Demand creation expense Total Demand creation expense was 4060 million 3850 million and 3114 million for the years ended May 31 2023 2022 and 2021 respectively Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled 755 million and 773 million at May 31 2023 and 2022 respectively of which 372 million and 329 million respectively were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and 383 million and 444 million respectively were recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applied OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE Operating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefitrelated expenses research and development costs bad debt expense as well as other administrative expenses such as rent depreciation and amortization professional services certain technology investments meetings and travel CASH AND EQUIVALENTS Cash and equivalents represent cash and shortterm highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates with maturities three months or less at the date of purchase 2023 FORM 10K 62 Table of Contents SHORTTERM INVESTMENTS Shortterm investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities over three months at the date of purchase At May 31 2023 and 2022 Shortterm investments consisted of availableforsale debt securities which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of tax in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss unless unrealized losses are determined to be unrecoverable Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification The Company considers all availableforsale debt securities including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within Shortterm investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Refer to Note 4 Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys Shortterm investments ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable net consist primarily of amounts due from customers The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations the Company considers historical levels of credit losses as well as macroeconomic and industry trends to determine the amount of the allowance The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was 35 million and 34 million as of May 31 2023 and 2022 respectively INVENTORY VALUATION Inventories substantially all of which are finished goods are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis In some instances the Company ships products directly from its suppliers to the customer with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Companys suppliers as well as inbound freight import duties taxes insurance logistics and other handling fees PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION Property plant and equipment are recorded at cost Depreciation is determined on a straightline basis for land improvements buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over 2 to 12 years on a straightline basis The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software The Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities training maintenance and all other postimplementation stage activities are expensed as incurred Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers In most instances the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established therefore software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred 2023 FORM 10K 63 Table of Contents IMPAIRMENT OF LONGLIVED ASSETS The Company reviews the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value GOODWILL AND INDEFINITELIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment the Company allocates goodwill across its reporting units which are considered the Companys operating segments For both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets which primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life is less than its carrying amount If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount an impairment test is unnecessary If an impairment test is necessary the Company will estimate the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset If the carrying value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value There were no accumulated impairment losses as of May 31 2023 and 2022 Additionally the impact to Goodwill as a result of acquisitions and divestitures during fiscal 2023 and 2022 was not material OPERATING LEASES The Company primarily leases retail store space certain distribution and warehouse facilities office space equipment and other nonreal estate assets The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at the commencement date which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the asset Lease components are not separated from nonlease components for real estate leases within the Companys lease portfolio Rightofuse ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term with lease expense recognized on a straightline basis The Companys incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable Lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses renewal or termination options rent holidays or certain landlord incentives including tenant improvement allowances ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced by the amount of lease incentives The lease term includes the noncancelable period of the lease and options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options The Company does not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes related lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straightline basis over the lease term Certain lease agreements include variable lease payments which are based on a percent of retail sales over specified levels or adjust periodically for inflation as a result of changes in a published index primarily the Consumer Price Index and are expensed as incurred FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives equity securities and availableforsale debt securities Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date The Company uses a threelevel hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used as follows 2023 FORM 10K 64 Table of Contents Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active Level 3 Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing Observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates forward pricing curves currency volatilities currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties The Companys fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded Refer to Note 4 Fair Value Measurements for additional information FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into US Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income loss The Companys global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement the impact of which is recorded in Other income expense net within the Consolidated Statements of Income ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss Longterm debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and if designated the extent to which the hedge is effective The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For designated net investment hedges this is within the Cash provided by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For the Companys fair value hedges which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Refer to Note 12 Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives STOCKBASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value net of estimated forfeitures of equity awards and recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense as applicable in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straightline basis over the vesting period Substantially all awards vest ratably over four years of continued employment with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant Performancebased restricted stock units vest based on the Companys achievement of certain performance criteria throughout the threeyear performance period and continued employment through the vesting date The fair value of options stock appreciation rights and employees purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans ESPPs is determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model The fair value of restricted stock and timevesting restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant The fair value of performancebased restricted stock units is estimated as of the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation Refer to Note 9 Common Stock and StockBased Compensation for additional information on the Companys stockbased compensation programs 2023 FORM 10K 65 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain At least quarterly the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies The Company uses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization which are inherently uncertain and can result in significant variation between estimated and actual results To the extent the Company believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset which increases the Companys income tax expense in the period when such determination is made The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes for further discussion EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards Refer to Note 10 Earnings Per Share for further discussion MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ from these estimates Additionally the macroeconomic environment could remain volatile as the risk exists that worsening macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse impact on future revenue growth as well as overall profitability RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2022 the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU ASU 202204 Liabilities Supplier Finance

Other income expense net CASH FLOW HEDGES All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedge instruments are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction Effective hedge results are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure When it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period hedge accounting is discontinued and the Company accounts for the associated derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below Additionally the gains and losses associated with derivatives no longer designated as cash flow hedge instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss are recognized immediately in Other income expense net if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional twomonth period thereafter In rare circumstances the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company The purpose of the Companys foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Companys consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costs nonfunctional currency denominated revenues intercompany revenues demand creation expenses investments in US Dollar denominated availableforsale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions Product cost foreign currency exposures are primarily generated through nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases NIKE entities primarily purchase product in two ways 1 Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from thirdparty factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency 2023 FORM 10K 79 Table of Contents exposure for the NTC 2 Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from thirdparty factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was 182 billion as of May 31 2023 As of May 31 2023 approximately 419 million of deferred net gains net of tax on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature As of May 31 2023 the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 27 months FAIR VALUE HEDGES The Company has in the past been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31 2023 NET INVESTMENT HEDGES The Company has in the past hedged and may in the future hedge the risk of variability in foreign currencydenominated net investments in whollyowned international operations All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2023 UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other income expense net together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was 47 billion as of May 31 2023 CREDIT RISK The Company is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings however this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted To manage this risk the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored The Companys derivative contracts contain credit riskrelated contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business The Companys bilateral creditrelated contingent features generally require the owing entity either the Company or the derivative counterparty to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of 50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than 50 million Additionally a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral requirements As of May 31 2023 the Company was in compliance with all credit riskrelated contingent features and derivative instruments with such features were in a net liability position of approximately 2 million Accordingly the Company posted no cash collateral as a result of these contingent features Further as of May 31 2023 the Company had received 36 million in cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial For additional information related to the Companys derivative financial instruments and collateral refer to Note 4 Fair Value Measurements 2023 FORM 10K 80 Table of Contents NOTE 13

totaling 588 million and 289 million respectively issued primarily for real estate agreements selfinsurance programs other general business obligations and legal matters In connection with various contracts and agreements the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor Currently the Company has several such agreements in place However based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations In the ordinary course of business the Company is subject to various legal proceedings claims and government investigations relating to its business products and actions of its employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability antitrust customs tax intellectual property and other matters The outcome of these legal matters is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot predict the eventual outcome of currently pending matters the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses fines penalties or consequences relating to those matters When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter If one or more legal matters were to be resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above managements expectations the Companys financial position operating results and cash flows for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected In the opinion of management based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel the Company does not believe any currently pending legal matters will have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations financial position or cash flows except as described below BELGIAN CUSTOMS CLAIM The Company has received claims for certain years from the Belgian Customs Authorities for alleged underpaid duties related to products imported beginning in fiscal 2018 The Company disputes these claims and has engaged in the appellate process The Company has issued bank guarantees in order to appeal the claims At this time the Company is unable to estimate the range of loss and cannot predict the final outcome as it could take several years to reach a resolution on this matter If this matter is ultimately resolved against the Company the amounts owed including fines penalties and other consequences relating to the matter could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations financial position and cash flows NOTE 17 LEASES Lease expense is recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income based on
