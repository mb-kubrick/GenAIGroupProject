work closely with each industrys respective OEMs original design manufacturers or ODMs system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers or AIBs retailersdistributors and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our Channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products Members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process We also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our Channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our Channels timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our Channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products As a result of our Channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue However their end customers consist of a large number of OEMs and system builders throughout the world Sales to our largest customer accounted for 11 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2015 Additionally to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products and enterprise applications optimized for our GPUs we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community Engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems Our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software applications and game titles that are optimized for our products 7 Table of Contents Backlog Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability The semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules In light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant Seasonality Our GPU and Tegra processor products serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider cloud datacenters however a majority of our revenue is consumer focused Our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year However there can be no assurance that this trend will continue Manufacturing We do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products Instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging This strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing In addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations Our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products As a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support We utilize industryleading suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers We then utilize independent subcontractors such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc BYD Auto Co Ltd Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd JSI Logistics Ltd King Yuan Electronics Co Ltd and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products We purchase substrates from IbidenCo Ltd Nanya Technology Corporation and Unimicron Technology Corporation We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or CEMs distributors motherboard and AIB customers from our thirdparty warehouse in Hong Kong Generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or OEMs as motherboard and addin board solutions Working Capital We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand The quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules A substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands Our existing cash and marketable securities balances decreased by 10 to 462 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015 compared with the end of fiscal year 2014 We believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition capital purchases and intended capital return to shareholders needs for at least the next twelve months 8 Table of Contents Research and Development We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3D graphics HD video audio ultralow power consumption and SOC architectures is essential to our future success Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of GPUs and Tegra Processors including GPUs for highperformance computing and Tegra SOCs for SHIELD and other mobile products using independent design teams Our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms These groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products A critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry We invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of PC OEMs and other manufacturers We believe in leveraging our significant research and development depth and scale to create differentiated products As of January 25 2015 we had 6658 fulltime employees engaged in research and development During fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred research and development expense of 136 billion 134 billion and 115 billion respectively Competition The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products In addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs and mobile SOC products Some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes Our current competitors include suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as Advanced Micro Devices or AMD and Intel Corporation or Intel suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into smart devices such as televisions monitors settop boxes gaming devices and automobiles such as AMD Apple Inc Freescale Semiconductor Inc Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Co Ltd Intel Marvell Technology Group Ltd Mediatek Mobileye NV Qualcomm Incorporated Samsung ST Microelectronics and Texas Instruments Incorporated and licensors of graphics technologies such as ARM Holdings plc or ARM and Imagination Technologies Group plc 9 Table of Contents Patents and Proprietary Rights We rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS In evaluating NVIDIA and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10K Before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below Any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline Additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business Risks Related to Our Business Industry and Partners If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets our revenue and financial results will be adversely impacted NVIDIAbranded products and services are visual computing platforms that address four large markets Gaming Enterprise High Performance Computing Cloud and Automotive Our GPUs and Tegra processors are designed to meet the evolving needs of these markets however these markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve and new competitors enter these markets Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify and develop new products services and technologies and enhancements to our existing products services and technologies in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve consumer and market acceptance of our products services and technologies If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets including in significant international markets such as China demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer In addition if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends our business will be harmed Our competitors products services and technologies may be less costly or their products services and technologies may offer superior functionality or different features than ours In addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets quickly transition their semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business If we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an integral part of our future success Our OEM ODM and AIB and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows If OEMs ODMs and AIB and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration In order to achieve design wins we must anticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers and price our products competitively In general we are limited in our ability to introduce new products and enhancements to our customers design cycles and we must maintain compliance with evolving industry standards Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies 12 Table of Contents If our intellectual property licensing strategy is not successful our licensing revenues may decline We intend to license our GPU cores and visual computing patent portfolio to device manufacturers who offer products in markets such as mobile The extent of the demand to license our GPU cores or other elements of our visual computing patent portfolio is unknown and may be limited In addition we may not be able to renew our existing license agreements In January 2011 we entered into a patent cross licensing agreement under which Intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of 150 billion over six years The final 2000 million payment under this agreement is scheduled to be received in January 2016 and recognized as revenue into the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 If we are unable to enter into new licensing agreements or renew our existing agreements and these agreements are not offset by other growth in income our financial results may be adversely affected If our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share Our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system Our products are used by a variety of industries including the automotive industry Failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs ODMs AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue In addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins and harm our relationships with customers Also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field A product recall particularly an automotive recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive could damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us such as product liability suits If a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business System security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation Security breaches computer malware and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur in the future Experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products For portions of our IT infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems Data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systems Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose us our partners our customers third parties or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful We may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions Delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 13 Table of Contents We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility Instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques Similarly we do not assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc BYD Auto Co Ltd Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd JSI Logistics Ltd King Yuan Electronics Co and Siliconware Precision Industries Co Ltd We do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors As a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our products a failure to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis loss of a supplier and additional expense andor production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality and delays in product shipments shortages a decrease in product quality andor higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors orders over our orders or otherwise We also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements To bring new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner we utilize sophisticated and technologically advanced software development tools to complete our design simulations and verifications In the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products In the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline If our products fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields our financial results could be adversely impacted and our reputation with our customers may be harmed Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry When a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause As a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem Because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers Lower than expected yields could harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results 14 Table of Contents Business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and increase our costs and expenses Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in Asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity In addition a majority of our principal IT datacenters are located in California making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area The manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including Taiwan China and Korea Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues The ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown In the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event our revenue could decline and our business may be harmed We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could decline if we lose any of these customers We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers Revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was 11 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal year 2015 21 of our total revenue from two customers in fiscal year 2014 and 13 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal year 2013 The percentage of revenue we receive from our largest customers has fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors In the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty our customers may develop their own solutions our customers may purchase products from our competitors or our customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products The loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers In the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient Our gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin Our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products sold average selling prices introduction of new products product transitions sales discounts pricing actions by our competitors the cost of product components and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products We are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate the impact of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee our gross margins may be negatively impacted In addition gross margins for our Tegra processors are lower than our overall corporate gross margins If Tegra processors comprise a higher percentage of our future revenue or if we continue to enter into new business areas with comparatively lower margins our overall gross margins may decline 15 Table of Contents If we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a customers product that does not materialize In estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions including downturns in our target markets andor overall economy changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit market a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products or increased competition including competitive pricing actions In addition the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins In addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals We could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial results Conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis Even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner If we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our business We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and Other Americas We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers outside the United States and Other Americas Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 75 of total revenue for both fiscal year 2015 and 2014 and 74 of total revenue for fiscal year 2013 The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties including international economic and political conditions such as political tensions between countries in which we do business unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions financial risks such as longer payment cycles difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and foreign exchange rate fluctuations and increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations such as carbon taxes fuel or energy taxes and pollution limits If sales to any of our customers outside of the United States and Other Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 16 Table of Contents We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products We have in the past and intend to continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business Any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results difficulty in combining the technology products operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business diversion of capital and other resources including managements attention assumption of liabilities incurring amortization expenses impairment charges to goodwill or writedowns of acquired assets potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality architecture and development or legal and financial contingencies among other things and impairment of relationships with employees vendors and customers or the loss of any of our key employees vendors or customers or our targets key employees vendors or customers as a result of our acquisition or investment Risks Related to Regulatory Legal Our Common Stock and Other Matters Actions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights such as litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we fail to take such actions or are unsuccessful in doing so We rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections We have in the past and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results Further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation For example in September 2014 we filed complaints against Qualcomm Inc and various Samsung entities with both the ITC and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for infringement of seven patents relating to graphics processing In November 2014 various Samsung entities filed a complaint against us and Velocity Micro for alleged infringement of Samsungs patents If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third parties patent or other intellectual property rights However we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted Furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 17 Table of Contents Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors For example our operating expenses represent a significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period In particular our research and development expenses reflect multiyear commitments to the development of new products and enhancements that will not result in revenue if any until future periods Therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance Factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include demand and market acceptance for our products andor our customers products the successful development and volume production of our nextgeneration products our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to multiyear development cycle for some of our products and services new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors our introduction of new products in accordance with OEMs design requirements and design cycles changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers products the level of growth or decline of the PC industry in general seasonal fluctuations associated with the PC and consumer products market contraction in automotive and consumer endmarket demand due to adverse regional or worldwide economic conditions slower than expected growth of demand for new technologies fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders the loss of a significant customer substantial disruption in the operations of our foundries or other thirdparty subcontractors as a result of a natural disaster equipment failure terrorism or other causes supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers products including memory devices costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products unexpected inventory writedowns or writeoffs legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits availability of software and technology licenses at commercially reasonable terms for the continued sale or development of new products customer bad debt writeoffs changes in our effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates applicable tax laws or interpretations of tax laws any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property costs to comply with new government regulations such as the SECs conflict mineral regulations and regulatory enforcement actions costs to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting our inability to forecast changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards and general macroeconomic events and factors affecting the overall semiconductor industry Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility and as a result investors may suffer losses In the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities We have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation Such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business In addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 18 Table of Contents We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations In December 2013 we issued 15 billion of 100 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 or 100 Notes Our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions The exercise of warrants issued to Goldman Sachs Co concurrently with our 100 Notes would and the conversion of our 100 Notes could dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders The warrants issued concurrently with our 100 Notes will be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between March 2019 and June 2019 unless Goldman Sachs Co notifies us otherwise Any issuance by us of additional shares to Goldman Sachs Co upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders In addition the conversion of our 100 Notes will dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders and could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the 100 Notes Any sales in the public market by Goldman Sachs Co of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants or sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 100 Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control Our status as a Delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders In addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock These provisions include the following the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval a supermajority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders and the ability of our Board of Directors to make amend or repeal our bylaws On March 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox Under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable 19 Table of Contents ITEM 2 PROPERTIES Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara California It includes eight leased commercial buildings totaling 887993 square feet and real property that we own which consists of twelve commercial buildings on 36 acres of land We expect to eventually build a new corporate headquarters campus on this owned property However during fiscal year 2014 we leased and occupied an office building within the boundaries of our Santa Clara campus that balanced the workspace needs for our Santa Clara staff and provided us the opportunity to delay the start of the new campus building and refine our design to further optimize for functionality and cost In addition we also lease datacenter space in Santa Clara Outside of Santa Clara we lease space in Austin Texas and a number of regional facilities in other US locations which are used as research and development centers andor sales and administrative offices Outside of the United States we own a building in Hyderabad India which is being used primarily as a research and development center We also lease facilities in various international locations as research and development centers andor sales and administrative offices These leased facilities are located primarily in Asia and Europe We believe that we currently have sufficient facilities to conduct our operations for the next twelve months For additional information regarding obligations under leases see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the subheading Lease Obligations which information

infotainment systems powered by NVIDIA including the BMW i8 and i3 the Volkswagen Golf and Passat and the Honda Civic Civic Tourer and CRV Capital Return to Shareholders During fiscal year 2015 we repurchased 444 million shares of our common stock for 8136 million and paid 1865 million in cash dividends As a result we returned 100 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2015 in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments On November 6 2014 we announced our intention to return approximately 6000 million to our shareholders in fiscal year 2016 through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends On February 11 2015 we declared that we would pay our next quarterly cash dividend of 0085 per share on March 19 2015 to all shareholders of record on February 26 2015 Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further discussion Litigation In September 2014 we filed lawsuits against Qualcomm Inc and various Samsung entities in the United States International Trade Commission or ITC and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for using our GPU patents without a license On November 10 2014 Samsung filed a complaint against NVIDIA and Velocity Micro Inc in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia The complaint alleges that NVIDIA infringed six patents and falsely advertised that the Tegra K1 processor is the worlds fastest mobile processor On December 19 2014 Samsung filed an amended longer complaint but asserting the same claims against NVIDIA Please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further discussion 27 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or US GAAP The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10K Revenue Recognition Product Revenue We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured For sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and in some cases when customer return rights lapse Our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor While we have a long history of rebate arrangements with OEMs we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual OEMs In such cases the OEMs may not be our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix of demand they place on their CEMsODMs may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings In addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents approximately 05 of total revenue Our customer programs also include marketing development funds or MDFs MDFs represent monies paid to retailers system builders OEMs distributors addin card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products Depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 28 Table of Contents License and Development Revenue For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed For most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project We periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue Please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly for older products as newer products are introduced or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition In addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory Also because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals Charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 594 million 501 million and 899 million for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 13 12 and 21 respectively Sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 324 million 434 million and 537 million for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 favorably impacting our gross margin by 07 11 and 13 respectively As a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 06 01 and 08 in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively During fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of GPU and Tegra Processor products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products As a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand In doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints We also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions all of which may impact demand for our products Please refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion Income Taxes We recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized 29 Table of Contents United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonUS subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly As of January 25 2015 we had a valuation allowance of 2610 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value We have identified two reporting units GPU and Tegra Processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis Goodwill assigned to these reporting units as of January 25 2015 was 2097 million and 4085 million respectively Determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we elected to use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit In applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business When performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions Our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance Additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance The longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable Significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill The fair value of our GPU reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value and the fair value of our Tegra Processor reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 21 As such even if we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit it still would not have resulted in the fair value of our reporting units being less than their carrying values As an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our reporting units we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date The reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization However any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units Such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting units 30 Table of Contents In particular the fair value of our Tegra reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 21 The fair value of this reporting unit was assessed using a combination of income and market approaches The underlying assumptions we used in assessing the fair value of the Tegra reporting unit include but are not limited to assumptions around future revenue growth rates gross margins operating expense investment levels overall market growth rates our market share of the overall market and the appropriate discount rates to apply to future cash flows If the actual future results of the Tegra reporting unit do not achieve the levels we estimated in assessing its fair value the fair value of the Tegra reporting unit could decline A future decline in the fair value of the Tegra reporting unit could result a charge to our earnings as a result of a writedown of the value of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit Our next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist Such indicators include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions Such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a decrease in fair value and require us to record goodwill impairment charges Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets Our Level 1 assets consist of our money market funds We classify securities within Level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets Our availableforsale securities are classified as having Level 2 inputs Our Level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian Most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on Level 2 inputs We did not have any investments classified as Level 3 as of January 25 2015 All of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments If the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument In these situations we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value For availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors The credit loss component is recognized in earnings We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 25 2015 We concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no other than temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of availableforsale investments as of January 25 2015 Stockbased Compensation Our stockbased compensation expense is associated with stock options restricted stock units or RSUs performance stock units or PSUs and our employee stock purchase plan or ESPP During fiscal year 2015 we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs and PSUs to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on the Companys level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year The number of shares of our stock to be received at vesting ranges from 0 to 200 of the target amount 31 Table of Contents We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of RSUs and PSUs The compensation expense for RSUs is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our ESPP using the BlackScholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year Stockbased compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model Our RSU and PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is discounted by the dividend yield Additionally we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates If factors change the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period Litigation Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters However there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments If that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with US GAAP However the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs Results of Operations The following table sets forth

for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively A discussion of our revenue results for each of our reporting segments and the All Other category is as follows GPU Business GPU business revenue increased by 11 in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 This increase was due primarily to higher revenue from GeForce GTX GPUs and associated memory for gaming reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and increased sales of our Maxwellbased GPU products Revenue from Tesla for accelerated datacenter computing increased due to large project wins with cloud service providers and revenue from our NVIDIA GRID virtualization products also increased as this platform gained momentum Revenue from GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to last year GPU business revenue increased by 7 in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 This increase was largely attributable to strength in our highend GeForce GTX GPUs driven by gaming market segment demand The GPU business also benefited from higher sales of Tesla accelerated datacenter computing and Quadro enterprise products in fiscal year 2014 Offsetting these growth areas were declines in the overall market for mainstream desktop PCs and notebooks which contributed to lower unit volumes of our mainstream GeForce GPUs Tegra Processor Business Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 45 in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 This increase was driven by higher sales of Tegra products serving automotive infotainment systems smartphones and tablet devices and the onset of SHIELD tablet sales in fiscal year 2015 Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 48 in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 This decrease was primarily due to lower sales of our previous generation Tegra 3based products for smartphones and tablet devices Additionally sales of our embedded products for entertainment devices and revenue from license fees related to game consoles also decreased during fiscal year 2014 These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of Tegra 4based products for smartphones and tablet devices as well as for automotive infotainment systems All Other License revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with Intel in January 2011 was flat at 2640 million for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 75 of total revenue for both fiscal years 2015 and 2014 and 74 of total revenue for fiscal year 2013 Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location Revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized as follows Year Ended January 25 2015 January 26 2014 January 27 2013 Revenue Customer A 11 11 13 Customer B 9 10 9 33 Table of Contents Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold Our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell which is often difficult to estimate with accuracy Therefore if we experience product transition challenges if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines our gross margin may be negatively impacted Our overall gross margin was 555 549 and 520 for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively The increase over these fiscal years was driven primarily by a richer product mix in our GPU business partially offset by lower Tegra business margins Charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 594 million 501 million and 899 million for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 13 12 and 21 respectively Sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 324 million 434 million and 537 million for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 favorably impacting our gross margin by 07 11 and 13 respectively As a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 06 01 and 08 in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reporting segments is as follows GPU Business The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 due to richer product mix resulting from strong sales of highend GeForce GTX GPU products based on our Maxwell architecture and the volume increase in our Tesla accelerated computing products The increase in fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a combination of a richer product mix of our highend GeForce GTX GPU Tesla high performance computing and Quadro professional workstation products Lower inventory provisions for excess inventory in fiscal year 2014 also contributed to the increase Tegra Processor Business The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business decreased during fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 and during fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013 These decreases were driven primarily by a combination of an overall decline in margins of our Tegra products and a less rich mix between tablet products which have had higher gross margins and smartphone and automotive module products which have had comparably lower gross margins 34 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Year

2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 Compensation and benefits increased by 565 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense Offsetting this increase was a 389 million decrease in engineering development expenses Research and development expenses increased by 16 in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 Compensation and benefits increased by 1019 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs The growth in engineering employees also drove an increase in facilities and IT support expense of 346 million purchases of computer and software supplies of 141 million and depreciation and amortization of 110 million In addition engineering development expenses increased by 232 million primarily related to the ramp up of Tegra products Sales General and Administrative Sales general and administrative expenses increased by 10 in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 Compensation and benefits increased by 537 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense Facilities costs increased by 103 million as we expanded our offices internationally and leased an office building within the boundaries of our main Santa Clara campus Offsetting these increases were a decrease in outside professional fees of 88 million as well as more favorable international taxes and government subsidies Sales general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 Compensation and benefits increased by 379 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs Offsetting this increase were the absence of both a 201 million charge for a charitable contribution and a charge of 31 million for a class action settlement that we recorded in fiscal year 2013 35 Table of Contents Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 Interest income was 281 million 171 million and 199 million in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively The increase in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to higher average cash balances as we invested the proceeds from the convertible notes we issued in December 2013 in interest bearing securities The decrease in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the result of lower average cash balances as we liquidated a portion of our investment portfolio to fund an accelerated share repurchase transaction during the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 Interest expense was 461 million 104 million and 33 million in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively The increases in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 compared to fiscal years 2014 and 2013 respectively were primarily due to coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes we issued in December 2013 Other Income and Expense Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities sales or impairments of investments in nonaffiliated companies and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates Net other income expense was 139 million 74 million and 28 million in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively The increase for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain from the sale of a nonaffiliated investment partially offset by the recognition of an impairment loss of a nonaffiliated investment during the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and losses from foreign currency remeasurement The increase in other income for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to an increase in gains from foreign currency remeasurements and a gain from the sale of a nonaffiliated investment Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of 1242 million 703 million and 995 million during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 165 138 and 150 in fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal year 2015 and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014 Our effective tax rate on income before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the United States federal statutory rate of 35 due to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate is lower favorable recognition of the US federal research tax credit and release of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain nonUS jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefits Please refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional

in inventories resulting from the introduction of newly launched Maxwellbased GPUs and certain Tegra SOCs and SHIELD devices and an increase in accounts receivable Cash provided by operating activities increased slightly in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily due to a decrease in operating assets offset by a decrease in net income The decrease in operating assets was driven mainly by a combination of a decrease in accounts receivable resulting from strong collections and linear monthly shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 and a decrease in inventories Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2015 decreased from fiscal year 2014 primarily due to lower purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2014 increased from fiscal year 2013 driven primarily by capital expenditures in fiscal year 2014 for new technology licenses and leasehold improvements at our facilities in various locations Cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2015 resulted primarily from our repurchase of 8136 million of shares of our common stock and our cash dividend payments totaling 1865 million These uses of cash were offset by cash proceeds of 1535 million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans Cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2014 due primarily to the net proceeds of 148 billion we received from the convertible note offering that was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 as well as cash proceeds of 702 million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans Concurrent with the convertible note offering we used net proceeds of 1080 million to fund the related note hedge and warrant transactions During fiscal year 2014 we also used 8873 million to repurchase shares of our common stock and paid 1813 million of cash dividends to shareholders 37 Table of Contents Liquidity Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations Our investment portfolio consists principally of cash and cash equivalents debt securities of corporations and United States government and its agencies assetbacked securities mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and foreign government bonds These investments are denominated in United States dollars As of January 25 2015 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities Please refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information As of January 25 2015 and January 26 2014 we had 462 billion and 467 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities and the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration as specified in our investment policy guidelines These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer or type of instrument As of January 25 2015 we were in compliance with our investment policy As of January 25 2015 our investments in US government agencies and US government sponsored enterprises represented 35 of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for 30 of our total investment portfolio All of our investments are with AA3 or better rated securities We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 25 2015 Based on our quarterly impairment review we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and did not record any impairment during fiscal year 2015 Net realized gains were 01 million 24 million and 05 million for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively As of January 25 2015 we had a net unrealized gain of 84 million which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of 110 million offset by 26 million of gross unrealized losses As of January 26 2014 we had a net unrealized gain of 48 million which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of 72 million offset by 24 million of gross unrealized losses Our accounts receivable are highly concentrated Two customers accounted for 30 of our accounts receivable balance at January 25 2015 We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside of the United States As of January 25 2015 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 172 billion held within the United States and 290 billion held outside of the United States Most of the amounts held outside the United States may be repatriated to the United States but under current law would be subject to US federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits Further repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws As of January 25 2015 we have not provided for US federal and state income taxes on approximately 227 billion of undistributed earnings of nonUnited States subsidiaries as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States Although we have no current need to do so if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the United States we would incur US federal and state income tax less applicable foreign tax credits and reduced by the current amount of our US federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards Further in addition to the 172 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the United States and available to fund our US operations and any other US cash needs we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the United States other than by repatriation of foreign earnings where US income tax may otherwise be due Accordingly we do not reasonably expect any material effect on our business as a whole or to our financial flexibility with respect to our current cash balances held outside of the United States Dividend payments and any share repurchases must be made from cash held in the United States For fiscal year 2015 we made total cash dividend payments of 1865 million and repurchased 8136 million of our common stock utilizing a significant amount of our US cash balance previously taxed as of January 25 2015 38 Table of Contents Convertible Notes On December 2 2013 we issued 150 billion of 100 Convertible Senior Notes or the Notes due in 2018 and concurrently entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions and used 143 million to repurchase shares of our common stock from purchasers of the Notes in privately negotiated transactions The Notes will mature on December 1 2018 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date As of January 25 2015 none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further discussion Capital Return to Shareholders Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to 370 billion of our common stock through January 2016 As of January 25 2015 we had repurchased 32652 million of that amount leaving up to 4348 million available under this authorization through January 2016 During fiscal year 2015 we repurchased 444 million shares of our common stock for 8136 million and paid 1865 million in cash dividends equivalent to 0085 per share on a quarterly basis or 034 per share on an annual basis to our common shareholders As a result we returned 10 billion to shareholders during fiscal year 2015 in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments On November 6 2014 we announced our intention to return approximately 6000 million to our shareholders in fiscal year 2016 through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends On February 11 2015 we declared that we would pay our next quarterly cash dividend of 0085 per share on March 19 2015 to all shareholders of record on February 26 2015 Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our Boards continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further discussion Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition share repurchase cash dividend and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months However there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent shareholders We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include decreased demand and market acceptance for our products andor our customers products inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our nextgeneration products competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors We expect to spend approximately 1500 million to 2000 million for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2016 primarily for facilities emulation equipment computers and engineering workstations 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 25 2015 Payment Due By

plus the related interest and penalties of 144 million recorded in noncurrent income tax payable as of January 25 2015 We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability or interestpenalty payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions 4 Represents the remaining portion of a retention program totaling approximately 615 million that we initiated in fiscal year 2012 in connection with our acquisition of Icera As of January 25 2015 we have made payments of 580

sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation SK 303a4ii Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Please see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk As of January 25 2015 and January 26 2014 we had 462 billion and 467 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities We invest in a variety of financial instruments consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents debt securities of corporations and United States government and its agencies assetbacked securities mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and foreign government bonds As of January 25 2015 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities All of our investments are denominated in United States dollars As of January 25 2015 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments According to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of 26 million 28 million Please refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances Volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them As of January 25 2015 our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented 35 of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for 30 of our total investment portfolio Substantially all of our investments are with AA3 or better rated securities If the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 2 5 the fair values of these investments could decline by approximately 57 million 144 million On December 2 2013 we issued 150 billion of 100 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 or the Notes The Notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations of the Company which pay interest in cash semiannually at a rate of 100 per annum We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets Since the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates However the fair value of the Notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in Other expense net in our Consolidated Financial Statements and to date have not been significant The impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 was 05 million 47 million and 15 million respectively Sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete Conversely decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us Additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than US dollars Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar We may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates There were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at January 25 2015 ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Financial Officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud A control system no matter how well conceived and operated

Corporation In our opinion the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under item 15a1 present fairly in all material respects the financial position of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries at January 25 2015 and January 26 2014 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 25 2015 in

presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements Also in our opinion the Company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 25 2015 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements on the financial statement schedule and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects Our audits of the financial statements included examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate s PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose California March 11 2015 46 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Our Company NVIDIA is dedicated to advancing visual computing We enable individuals to interact with digital ideas data and entertainment with an ease and efficiency unmatched by any other communication medium Our two reporting segments GPU and Tegra Processor are based on a single underlying graphics architecture Our GPU product brands aimed at specialized markets include GeForce for gamers Quadro for designers Tesla for researchers deep learning and bigdata analysts and GRID for cloudbased visual computing users We also integrate our GPUs into tiny mobile chips called systemonachip SOC processors which power tablets and automotive infotainment and safety systems Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip incorporating GPUs and multicore CPUs with audio video and inputoutput capabilities They can also be integrated with baseband processors to add voice and data communication Tegra conserves power while delivering stateoftheart graphics and multimedia processing Headquartered in Santa Clara California NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998 All references to NVIDIA we us our or the Company mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries except where it is made clear that the term means only the parent company Fiscal Year We operate on a 52 or a 53week year ending on the last Sunday in January Fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 were 52week years Reclassifications Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and its whollyowned subsidiaries All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ from those estimates On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 53 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Revenue Recognition Product Revenue We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured For most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer At the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment For sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and in some cases when customer return rights lapse Our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue Our customer programs also include marketing development funds or MDFs MDFs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or OEMs distributors addin card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF programs We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns License and Development Revenue For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed For most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project A provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue Royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties We recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee Research and Development Expense Research and development expense includes the conceptual formulation design and testing of product alternatives construction of prototypes and operation of pilot plants Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 54 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Advertising Expenses We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 were 146 million 131 million and 92 million respectively Rent Expense We recognize rent expense on a straightline basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred but not paid Product Warranties We generally offer limited warranty to endusers that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition Under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated Stockbased Compensation We estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and recognize the expense using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or RSUs and performance stock units or PSUs The compensation expense for the RSUs is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or ESPP using the BlackScholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year Stockbased compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model Litigation Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters However there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments If that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with US GAAP However the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at endofperiod exchange rates Nonmonetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in Other income expense net in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant The impact of gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement included in determining other income expense net for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 was 05 million 47 million and 15 million respectively 55 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Income Taxes We recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonUS subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested Our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly As of January 25 2015 we had a valuation allowance of 2610 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period Our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 4119 million as of January 25 2015 Consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders equity if and when realized In determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to utilize the withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits We have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operations We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense Please refer to Note 13 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income loss Other comprehensive income loss components include unrealized gains losses on availableforsale securities net of tax Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method Under the treasury stock method the effect of stock options outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is antidilutive Additionally we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that requires us upon conversion to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock Our convertible notes note hedges and related warrants contain various conversion features which are further described in Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the convertible notes and warrants under the treasury stock method will be included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion is dilutive However unless actually exercised the note hedges will not be included in the calculation of diluted net income per share as their preexercised effect would be antidilutive under the treasury stock method 56 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents As of January 25 2015 and January 26 2014 our cash and cash equivalents were 4967 million and 11516 million respectively which include 1325 million and 3079 million invested in money market funds for fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014 respectively Marketable Securities Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as availableforsale These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity net of tax The fair value of interestbearing securities includes accrued interest Any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income and expense section of our consolidated statements of income Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income and expense section of our consolidated statements of income All of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments If the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument In these situations we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value For availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded as other comprehensive income Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 25 2015 and January 26 2014 Marketable securities are comprised of availableforsale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity net of tax Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents marketable securities accounts receivable and the note hedge Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities the diversification of asset type and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration All marketable securities are held in our name managed by several investment managers and held by one major financial institution under a custodial arrangement Accounts receivable from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total accounts receivable aggregated approximately 30 of our accounts receivable balance from two customers at January 25 2015 and approximately 23 of our accounts receivable balance from one customer at January 26 2014 We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit 57 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments We determine this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout and shipping costs as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions Once inventory has been writtenoff or writtendown it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently writtenup Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets generally three to five years Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and a gain or loss is recorded The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to twenty five years Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist For the purposes of completing our impairment test we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis For those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred where potential impairment indicators exist or for which we have not performed a quantitative assessment recently we utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach The second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities Please refer to Note 5 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Intangible Assets Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses patents acquired intellectual property trademarks and customer relationships and are subject to an annual impairment test We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from one to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern cannot be reliably determined using a straightline amortization method 58 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Impairment of LongLived Assets Longlived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations We account for asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs The accounting guidance applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development andor normal use of the assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset As of January 25 2015 and January 26 2014 our asset retirement obligations to return the leasehold improvements at our headquarters facility and certain laboratories at our domestic and international facilities to their original condition upon lease termination were 74 million and 111 million respectively Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014 the FASB issued a new accounting standard update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under US GAAP for all companies in all industries Under the new standard recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services In addition the new guidance requires that reporting companies disclose the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers including significant judgments and estimates used This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period Early adoption is not permitted We will adopt this guidance either by using a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined which transition method we will apply Note 2 StockBased Compensation Our stockbased compensation expense is associated with stock options RSUs PSUs and our ESPP Our consolidated statements of income include stockbased

1083 Weighted average grantdate fair value per share 499 560 516 During fiscal year 2015 we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs and PSUs to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on the Companys level of achievement versus the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year The number of shares of our stock to be received at vesting typically ranges from 0 to 200 of the target amount Of the estimated total grantdate fair value we estimated that the stockbased compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expected to vest for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 was 366 million 297 million and 271 million respectively January 25 January 26 2015 2014 In thousands Aggregated unearned stockbased compensation expense 291416 256500 Estimated weighted average amortization period In years Stock Options 18 25 RSUs and PSUs 28 27 ESPP 05 06 Valuation Assumptions We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of RSUs and PSUs Compensation expense for RSUs is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model We estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and recognize the expense using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period 60 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our ESPP using the BlackScholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year Stockbased compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model The fair value of stock options granted under our stock option plans and shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following

Riskfree interest rate 0105 0104 0103 Volatility 2331 3237 4447 Dividend yield 1719 2024 The expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of our valuation model and is impacted by the underlying assumptions of our company For ESPP shares the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date The riskfree interest rate assumption used to value stock options and ESPP is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term of the award Our expected stock price volatility assumption for stock options and ESPP is estimated using implied volatility For awards granted on or subsequent to November 8 2012 we use a dividend yield at grant date based on the per share dividends declared during the most recent quarter Our RSU and PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is discounted by the dividend yield Additionally for employee stock options and RSU and PSU awards we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience Equity Incentive Program We grant stock options RSUs PSUs and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan In 2007 our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan or the 2007 Plan The 2007 Plan was amended and restated in 2012 2013 and 2014 or the Restated 2007 Plan 61 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued The Restated 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options nonstatutory stock options restricted stock restricted stock unit stock appreciation rights performance stock awards performance cash awards and other stockbased awards to employees directors and

for an aggregate purchase price of 742 million On December 15 2000 NVIDIA Corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement or the APA which closed on April 18 2001 to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx In October 2002 3dfx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California In March 2003 the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court to represent 3dfxs bankruptcy estate served his complaint on NVIDIA The Trustees complaint asserted claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and sought additional payments from us In early November 2005 NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors or the Creditors Committee agreed to a Plan of Liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the Trustees claims against us This conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy Court The conditional settlement called for a payment by NVIDIA of 306 million to the 3dfx estate Under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and Trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx Accordingly during the three month period ended October 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx The Trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement The conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process On December 20 2010 the District Court issued an Order affirming the Bankruptcy Courts entry of summary judgment in NVIDIAs favor and on January 19 2011 the Trustee filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Oral argument on the appeal was held on October 8 2014 On November 6 2014 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Courts decision upholding the ruling of the Bankruptcy Court As a result we paid 56 million in related legal expenses The case concluded on February 5 2015 and we reversed the 250 million liability for additional contingent consideration and reduced the goodwill related to our 3dfx acquisition by the same amount as of January 25 2015

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued We allocate goodwill to our reporting units and perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist For the purposes of completing our impairment test we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis We utilized a quantitative analysis to complete our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values In a qualitative analysis we evaluate factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions market and industry conditions the competitive environment the operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units including cost factors and actual revenue results For reporting units in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value no further goodwill impairment testing is required For those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred where potential impairment indicators exist or for which we have not performed a quantitative assessment recently we utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business When performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions The market method of determining the fair value of our reporting units requires us to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market comparables Note 6 Amortizable

changes of the entitys product warranty liabilities Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities We record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties Under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products Additionally we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated During periods prior to fiscal year 2013 we recorded a cumulative net charge of 4759 million most of which was charged against cost of revenue to cover customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation MCP and GPU products used in notebook configurations During fiscal year 2014 we released the remaining 78 million unclaimed balance of that warranty accrual

and 78 million related to the release of the final unclaimed portion of that accrual during fiscal year 2014 In connection with certain agreements that we have executed in the past we have at times provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax product and employee liabilities We have also on occasion included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability As such we have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications 73 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Note 11 LongTerm Debt 100 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018 On December 2 2013 we issued 150 billion of the Notes The Notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations of the Company which pay interest in cash semiannually at a rate of 100 per annum The Notes will mature on December 1 2018 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date The Notes may be converted under the conditions specified below based on an initial conversion rate of 4960 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of Notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of 2016 per share of common stock subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to August 1 2018 only under the following circumstances 1 during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ended on April 27 2014 and only during such fiscal quarter if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day 2 during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price per 1000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day or 3 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events On or after August 1 2018 to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date holders may convert all or any portion of their notes regardless of the foregoing conditions Upon conversion we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver as the case may be cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election in respect of the remainder if any of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted As of January 25 2015 none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met The determination of whether or not the Notes are convertible must be performed quarterly If the Notes become convertible at the option of the holder the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Notes would be reflected as convertible debt in the mezzanine equity section on our Consolidated Balance Sheets In accordance with ASC 47020 Debt with Conversion and Other Options all cashsettled convertible debt should be separated into debt and equity components at issuance and be assigned a fair value The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value as of the issuance date of a similar debt without the conversion feature The difference between the net cash proceeds and this estimated fair value represents the value assigned to the equity component and is recorded as a debt discount The debt discount is amortized using the effective interest method from the origination date through its stated contractual maturity date The initial debt component of the Notes was valued at 13518 million based on the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate market rate for a nonconvertible debt at the date of issuance which was determined to be 315 The carrying value of the permanent equity component reported in additional paidincapital was valued at 1257 million and recorded as a debt discount This amount together with the 225 million purchasers discount to the par value of the Notes represents the total unamortized debt discount of 1482 million we recorded at the time of issuance of the Notes The aggregate debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Notes using the effective interest method using an interest rate of 315 74 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE

to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx The transaction closed on April 18 2001 In October 2002 3dfx filed for bankruptcy Following the bankruptcy in March 2003 the Trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court to represent 3dfxs bankruptcy estate served a complaint on NVIDIA asserting claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeking additional payments from us The Trustees fraudulent transfer theory alleged that NVIDIA had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfxs assets and sought recovery of the difference between the 700 million paid and the alleged fair value which difference the Trustee estimated to exceed 500 million The Trustees successor liability theory alleged NVIDIA was effectively 3dfxs legal successor and therefore was responsible for all of 3dfxs unpaid liabilities In early November 2005 after several months of mediation NVIDIA and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors or the Creditors Committee agreed to a Plan of Liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the Trustees claims against us This conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the Bankruptcy Court The conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process In March 2007 a trial was held regarding certain valuation issues in the Trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against NVIDIA On April 30 2008 the Bankruptcy Court issued its Memorandum Decision After Trial in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties contentions and evidence and concluded that the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the Transaction This decision did not entirely dispose of the Trustees action however as the Trustees claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending On June 19 2008 NVIDIA filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the Memorandum Decision After Trial to a final judgment That motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in NVIDIAs favor on September 11 2008 The Trustee filed a Notice of Appeal from that judgment on September 22 2008 and on September 25 2008 NVIDIA exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the United States District Court On December 20 2010 the District Court issued an Order affirming the Bankruptcy Courts entry of summary judgment in NVIDIAs favor and on January 19 2011 the Trustee filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Oral argument on the appeal was held on October 8 2014 On November 6 2014 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Courts decision upholding the ruling of the Bankruptcy Court and the case concluded on February 5 2015 77 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Securities Cases In September 2008 three putative securities class actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California arising out of our announcements on July 2 2008 that we would take a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated costs and expenses arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation MCP and GPU products and that we were revising financial guidance for our second quarter of fiscal year 2009 The actions purport to be brought on behalf of purchasers of NVIDIA stock and assert claims for violations of Sections 10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended On January 22 2010 Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint asserting claims for violations of Section 10b Rule 10b5 and Section 20a of the Securities Exchange Act and seeking unspecified compensatory damages We moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint and on October 19 2010 Judge Seeborg granted our motion with leave to amend On December 2 2010

November 10 2014 Samsung filed a complaint against NVIDIA and Velocity Micro Inc in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that NVIDIA infringed six patents and falsely advertised that the Tegra K1 processor is the worlds fastest mobile processor On December 19 2014 Samsung filed an amended longer complaint but asserting the same claims against NVIDIA Samsung seeks unspecified damages and an injunction prohibiting NVIDIA from any future violations NVIDIA answered the amended complaint on January 26 2015 and filed an amended answer on March 3 2015 On January 12 2015 NVIDIA moved to transfer the action to the Northern District of California and to sever and stay the proceedings against Velocity Micro Inc Briefing on the motion to transfer is now complete and submitted to the court for decision Accounting for Loss Contingencies While there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes we believe the claims made by other parties in the above ongoing matters are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend the actions As of January 25 2015 we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities while possible are not probable Further any possible range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time We are engaged in

150 in fiscal year 2013 The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal year 2015 and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014 Our effective tax rate on income before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the United States federal statutory rate of 35 due to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate is lower favorable recognition of the US federal research tax credit and release of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain nonUS jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefits As of January

or CODM reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments We report our business in two primary reporting segments the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business based on a single underlying graphics architecture Our GPU product brands aimed at specialized markets include GeForce for gamers Quadro for designers Tesla for researchers deep learning and bigdata analysts and GRID for cloudbased visual computing users We also integrate our GPUs into tiny mobile chips called systemonachip SOC processors which power tablets and automotive infotainment and safety systems Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip incorporating GPUs and multicore CPUs with audio video and inputoutput capabilities They can also be integrated with baseband processors to add voice and data communication Tegra conserves power while delivering stateoftheart graphics and multimedia processing We have a single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors This architecture unification leverages our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reporting segments our CODM assigns 100 of those expenses to the reporting segment that benefits the most The revenue and cost of revenue of the reporting segments was not affected and comparative periods presented below reflect the impact of this change The All Other category presented
