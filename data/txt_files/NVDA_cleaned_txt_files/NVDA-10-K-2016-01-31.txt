so too have our avenues to market SHIELD products such as our gaming tablet and Android TV device are sold through etail channels and through some of the worlds largest retailers 7 Table of Contents Backlog Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders The quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability The semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules In light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant Seasonality Our GPU and Tegra processor products serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider cloud datacenters however a majority of our revenue is consumer focused Our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year However there can be no assurance that this trend will continue Manufacturing We do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products Instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging This strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing In addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations While we directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products such as substrates and a variety of components our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products As a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support We utilize industryleading suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers We then utilize independent subcontractors such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc BYD Auto Co Ltd Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd JSI Logistics Ltd King Yuan Electronics Co Ltd and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products and platforms We purchase substrates from IbidenCo Ltd Nanya Technology Corporation and Unimicron Technology Corporation We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or CEMs distributors motherboard and AIB customers from our thirdparty warehouse in Hong Kong Generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or OEMs as motherboard and addin board solutions Working Capital We focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand The quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules A substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands Our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 9 to 504 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016 compared with the end of fiscal year 2015 We believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition capital expenditure and intended capital return to shareholders needs for at least the next twelve months 8 Table of Contents Research and Development We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology is essential to our future success Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of GPUs and Tegra Processors including GPUs for highperformance computing and Tegra SOCs for SHIELD and other mobile products using independent design teams Our research and development efforts include software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms A critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with industry leaders We invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of visual computing and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis We believe in leveraging our significant research and development depth and scale to create differentiated products As of January 31 2016 we had 6566 fulltime employees engaged in research and development During fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 we incurred research and development expense of 133 billion 136 billion and 134 billion respectively Competition The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and partners and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard Application Programming Interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products In addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs and mobile SOC products Some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes Our current competitors include suppliers of discrete and integrated GPUs including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as Advanced Micro Devices or AMD and Intel Corporation or Intel suppliers of SOC products that are embedded into automobiles and smart devices such as televisions monitors settop boxes gaming devices and automobiles such as Ambarella Inc AMD Apple Inc Avago Technologies Ltd Intel Marvell Technology

addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10K Before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below Any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline Additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business Risks Related to Our Business Industry and Partners If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets our revenue and financial results will be adversely impacted NVIDIAbranded products and services are visual computing platforms that address four large markets Gaming Professional Visualization Datacenter and Automotive Our products services and technologies are designed to meet the evolving needs of these markets however these markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve and new competitors enter these markets Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify and develop new products services and technologies and enhancements to our existing products services and technologies in a timely and costeffective manner and to achieve consumer and market acceptance of them If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets including in significant international markets such as China demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer In addition if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends our business will be harmed Our competitors products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or different features than ours In addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business If we fail to successfully execute our transitions to new business models and markets our results of operations could suffer In connection with our diversification into new business models we have transformed into a specialized platform company targeting markets where visual computing is essential and valued Our business strategy is dependent on creating products and services that anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends We cannot assure you that our new strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners We also devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where our operating history is less extensive such as the automotive market These new offerings and markets may require a considerable investment of technical financial compliance sales and marketing resources If demand for products and services from these growth markets is below our expectations or if we are not able to improve the cost or operational efficiencies of these new business models we may not realize benefits from our strategy Alternatively we may not be able to effectively implement our strategy or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities or meet competitive challenges If we are unable to successfully establish new offerings in light of the competitive environment our results of operations could suffer If we do not replace our Intel licensing revenues our financial results may be adversely affected In January 2011 we entered into a patent cross licensing agreement under which Intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of 150 billion over six years The final 200 million payment under this agreement was received in January 2016 We will be recognizing revenue under this agreement through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 If we do not enter into new licensing agreements or if the Intel agreement is not offset by other growth in income our financial results may be adversely affected 12 Table of Contents If our products fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields our financial results could be adversely impacted and our reputation with our customers and partners may be harmed Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry As a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem Because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers and partners Lower than expected yields could harm customer or partner relationships our reputation and our financial results If our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share Our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system Our products are used by a variety of industries including the automotive industry Failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs ODMs AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue In addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins and harm our relationships with customers and partners and consumers perceptions of our brand Also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field A product recall particularly an automotive recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits If a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business Further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial results System security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation Security breaches computer malware and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur in the future Experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time For portions of our IT infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems Data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systems Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful We may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions Delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation 13 Table of Contents We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility Instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques Similarly we do not assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc BYD Auto Co Ltd Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd JSI Logistics Ltd King Yuan Electronics Co and Siliconware Precision Industries Co Ltd We do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors As a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our products a failure to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis loss of a supplier and additional expense andor production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality and delays in product shipments shortages a decrease in product quality andor higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors orders over our orders or otherwise We also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner In the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline If we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor Our OEM ODM and AIB and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows If OEMs ODMs and AIB and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration In order to achieve design wins we must anticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers and price our products competitively Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers Further if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies 14 Table of Contents Business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in Asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity In addition a majority of our principal IT datacenters are located in California making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area The manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including Taiwan China and Korea Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues The ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown In the event of a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event our revenue could decline and our business may be harmed We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could decline if we lose any of these customers We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers Revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was 11 of our total revenue from one customer in both fiscal year 2016 and 2015 and 21 of our total revenue from two customers in fiscal year 2014 Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors In the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all to purchase fewer products than they did in the past or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty our customers may develop their own solutions our customers may purchase products from our competitors or our customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products The loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers In the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient Our gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross margin Our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products sold average selling prices introduction of new products and services process node transitions product transitions sales discounts pricing actions by our competitors the cost of product components and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products We are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate the impact of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee our gross margins may be negatively impacted In addition gross margins for our Tegra processors are lower than our overall corporate gross margins If Tegra processors comprise a higher percentage of our future revenue or if we continue to enter into new business areas with comparatively lower margins our overall gross margins may decline 15 Table of Contents If we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize In estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions including downturns in our target markets andor overall economy changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit market a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products less demand than expected for newlyintroduced products or increased competition including competitive pricing actions In addition the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins In addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals We could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial results Conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis Even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner If we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our business We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and Other Americas We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers outside the United States and Other Americas Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 79 of total revenue for fiscal year 2016 and 75 of total revenue for both fiscal year 2015 and 2014 The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties including international economic and political conditions such as political tensions between countries in which we do business unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions financial risks such as longer payment cycles difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and foreign exchange rate fluctuations and increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations such as carbon taxes fuel or energy taxes and pollution limits If sales to any of our customers outside of the United States and Other Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted 16 Table of Contents We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products We have in the past acquired and invested in and intend to continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business Any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results difficulty in combining the technology products operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business diversion of capital and other resources including managements attention assumption of liabilities incurring amortization expenses impairment charges to goodwill or writedowns of acquired assets potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality architecture and development or legal and financial contingencies among other things and impairment of relationships with or loss of our or our targets employees vendors and customers as a result of our acquisition or investment Risks Related to Regulatory Legal Our Common Stock and Other Matters Actions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products We have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results Further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third partys patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third partys patent or other intellectual property rights However we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted Furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results We rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections 17 Table of Contents Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors For example our operating expenses represent a significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period In particular our research and development expenses reflect multiyear commitments to the development of new products and enhancements that will not result in revenue if any until future periods Therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance Factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include demand and market acceptance for our products and services andor our customers products the successful development and volume production of our nextgeneration products our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multiyear development cycle for some of our products and services new product and service announcements or product and service introductions by our competitors our introduction of new products in accordance with OEMs design requirements and design cycles changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers products the level of growth or decline of the PC industry in general seasonal fluctuations associated with the PC and consumer products market contraction in automotive and consumer endmarket demand due to adverse regional or worldwide economic conditions slower than expected growth of demand for new technologies fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders the loss of a significant customer substantial disruption in the operations of our foundries or other thirdparty subcontractors as a result of a natural disaster equipment failure terrorism or other causes supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers products including memory devices costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products unexpected inventory writedowns or writeoffs legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits availability of software and technology licenses at commercially reasonable terms for the continued sale or development of new products customer bad debt writeoffs changes in our effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates applicable tax laws or interpretations of tax laws any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property costs to comply with new government regulations and regulatory enforcement actions costs to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards and general macroeconomic events and factors affecting the overall semiconductor industry and our target markets Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility and as a result investors may suffer losses In the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities We have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation Such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business In addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results 18 Table of Contents Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering various legislative proposals concerning data protection In addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices If so we may be ordered to change our data practices andor be fined Complying with these changing laws could cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations We are subject to risks associated with development and construction of our headquarters building under an operating lease financing arrangement In fiscal year 2016 we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara California which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 We may encounter unanticipated occurrences or conditions during construction that may increase the expense of the project We may also encounter unanticipated delays in the construction of the new building and final city approval for occupancy may be delayed We are financing this construction under an operating lease arrangement described below Delays and cost overruns during construction could result in a default under the operating lease financing arrangement which could result in liabilities and expenses and could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations Additionally any such difficulties could result in our default under the operative agreements entered into with a syndicate of banks that are participants to the operating lease financing arrangement to finance development and construction of our headquarters We have pledged our assets that relate to the new headquarters building in order to secure our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement We will need to maintain compliance with the requirements governing such agreements including compliance with financial and other covenants certain of which may be subject to events outside of our control If we fail to comply with the covenants we may be unable to obtain or utilize all or a portion of the financing contemplated by the operating lease financing arrangement Further noncompliance with such covenants or other event of default could lead to a termination of our lease of the property and the lenders could have the right to among other things foreclose on the collateral for our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement A loss of financing for the new headquarters building or foreclosure on the collateral could adversely affect our liquidity and business We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations In December 2013 we issued 15 billion of 100 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 or 100 Notes Our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions Additionally our obligation to make payments related to the 100 Notes when converted or due could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and other general corporate purposes The exercise of warrants associated with our 100 Notes would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders The warrants issued concurrently with our 100 Notes will be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between March 2019 and June 2019 unless the warrant holder notifies us otherwise Any issuance by us of shares upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders Any sales in the public market by the warrant holder of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 19 Table of Contents Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control Our status as a Delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders In addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock These provisions include the following the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval a supermajority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders and the ability of our Board of Directors to make amend or repeal our bylaws On March 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox Under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable ITEM 2 PROPERTIES Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara California It includes eight leased commercial buildings totaling 896565 square feet and real property that we own which consists of six commercial buildings on 36 acres of land During fiscal year 2016 we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara California which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018

in privately negotiated transactions or in structured share repurchase programs and may be made in one or more larger repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended or the Exchange Act subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion As part of our share repurchase program we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with

Summary Year Ended January 31 2016 January 25 2015 Change In millions except per share data Revenue 5010 4682 up 7 Gross margin 561 555 up 60 bps Operating expenses 2064 1840 up 12 Income from operations 747 759 down 2 Net income 614 631 down 3 Net income per diluted share 108 112 down 4 Revenue grew 7 in fiscal year 2016 to a record 501 billion GPU revenue was 419 billion up 9 from the previous year reflecting growth in GeForce GPUs for gaming and Tesla products for datacenter Tegra Processor revenue was 559 million down 3 from the previous year reflecting a decline in Tegra products for OEMs partially offset by an increase in Tegra products for automotive and development services License revenue from our patent license agreement with Intel remained flat at 264 million for fiscal year 2016 Gross margin for fiscal year 2016 was a record 561 up 60 basis points from the previous year led by the strength in GPU business revenue partially offset by lower Tegra Processor business gross margins Operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 were 206 billion up from 184 billion in the previous year Income from operations for fiscal year 2016 was 747 million down from 759 million in the previous year However these amounts for fiscal year 2016 included 131 million in restructuring and other charges for the winddown of our Icera modem operations and 70 million in legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm Net income for fiscal year 2016 was 614 million and net income per diluted share was 108 down from 631 million and 112 respectively in the previous year These decreases were driven by our legal fees and our restructuring and other charges partially offset by revenue and gross margin growth We returned 800 million to shareholders in fiscal year 2016 through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends and we intend to return approximately 100 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2017 Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 504 billion as of January 31 2016 up from 462 billion as of January 25 2015 and cash flow from operating activities was 118 billion for fiscal year 2016 up from 906 million in the previous year 27 Table of Contents GPU Business During fiscal year 2016 we released many new products including the GeForce GTX TITAN X GeForce GTX 980 Ti GeForce GTX 980 for notebook and the GeForce GTX 950 These GPUs deliver better performance and power efficiency than their predecessors and helped double the number of users of our GeForce Experience PC gaming platform from a year earlier Additionally we released NVIDIA GameWorks VR a software development kit that creates more immersive gameplay on virtual realityready desktops and notebooks and enables professional designers to bring virtual reality to applications We also announced the GeForce GTX VR Ready program to help users discover systems that will provide optimized virtual reality experiences We introduced the Quadro M6000 a powerful professional GPU and the Quadro Visual Computing Appliance which contains eight M6000 GPUs We also rolled out NVIDIA Iray plugins for Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max which enable users to create designs incorporating realworld lights and materials faster and easier than before and enabled professional designers to bring virtual reality to applications with the launch of NVIDIA DesignWorks VR We announced our nextgeneration Pascal GPU architecture This architecture is expected to accelerate deep learning applications faster than our currentgeneration Maxwell processors In addition we unveiled our next generation virtualized graphics platform NVIDIA GRID 20 which delivers graphicsintensive applications to connected devices We also shipped cuDNN 30 which improves performance of deep learning training on GPUs Further we announced that the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology was the first major national weather service to use a GPUaccelerated supercomputer to improve daily forecasts We introduced an endtoend hyperscale datacenter deep learning platform consisting of two accelerators the NVIDIA Tesla M40 and NVIDIA Tesla M4 that lets webservices companies accelerate deep learning workloads In addition we announced that leading webservices companies were increasingly adopting our accelerated service platform to power the machine learning and high performance computing applications Tegra Processor Business For the automotive market we are partnering with several companies to use our NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform a car computer that utilizes deep learning to enable selfdriving capabilities in their autonomous driving efforts We launched NVIDIA DRIVE PX 2 a powerful engine for invehicle artificial intelligence and announced that Volvo will use DRIVE PX 2 in their autonomouscar pilot program next year We were featured in new production vehicles and concept cars with NVIDIApowered digital cockpits including MercedesBenz Audi Porsche Bentley and Honda at the International Auto Show in Frankfurt Germany and also furthered our relationship with Tesla Motors which introduced the Model X equipped with an NVIDIApowered infotainment system and digital instrument cluster During fiscal year 2016 we launched the NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV device and GeForce NOW which allows players to stream video games from the cloud to their SHIELD devices 28 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or US GAAP The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10K Revenue Recognition Product Revenue We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured For sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and in some cases when customer return rights lapse Our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor While we have a long history of rebate arrangements with OEMs we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual OEMs In such cases the OEMs may not be our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix of demand they place on their CEMsODMs may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings In addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents less than 05 of total revenue Our customer programs also include marketing development funds or MDFs MDFs represent monies paid to retailers system builders OEMs distributors addin card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products Depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 29 Table of Contents License and Development Revenue For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed For most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project We periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total cost Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue Please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly for older products as newer products are introduced or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition In addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory Also because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 16 06 and 01 in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively The charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal years were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products As a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand In doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints We also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions all of which may impact demand for our products Please refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion 30 Table of Contents Income Taxes We recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonUS subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly As of January 31 2016 we had a valuation allowance of 272 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value We have identified two reporting units GPU and Tegra Processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis Goodwill assigned to these reporting units as of January 31 2016 was 210 million and 408 million respectively Determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we elected to use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit In applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business When performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions Our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance Additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance The longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable Significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units 31 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill The fair values of our GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values As such even the application of a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in the fair value of either reporting unit being less than its carrying value As an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our reporting units we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date The reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization However any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units Such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting units Our next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist Such indicators include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions Such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a decrease in fair value and require us to record goodwill impairment charges Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets Our Level 1 assets consist of our money market funds We classify securities within Level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets Our availableforsale securities are classified as having Level 2 inputs Our Level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian Most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on Level 2 inputs We did not have any investments classified as Level 3 as of January 31 2016 All of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments If the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument In these situations we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value For availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors The credit loss component is recognized in earnings We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 31 2016 We concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no other than temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of availableforsale investments as of January 31 2016 32 Table of Contents Stockbased Compensation Our stockbased compensation expense is associated with stock options restricted stock units or RSUs performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or PSUs performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased PSUs and our employee stock purchase plan or ESPP Beginning in fiscal year 2015 we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs PSUs and marketbased PSUs to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on the Companys level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year The number of shares of our stock to be received at vesting ranges from 0 to 200 of the target amount We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of RSUs and PSUs and we use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of marketbased PSUs We use a BlackScholes valuation at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year to estimate the fair value of the shares to be issued under our ESPP Stockbased compensation expense for RSUs and marketbased PSUs is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs and ESPP is recognized using an accelerated amortization model Our RSU PSU and marketbased PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair value of RSUs PSUs and marketbased PSUs is discounted by the dividend yield Additionally we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates If factors change the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period Litigation Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters However there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments If that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with US GAAP However the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table

552 13 GPU Business GPU business revenue increased by 9 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 This increase was due primarily to increased revenue from sales of highend GeForce GPU products for gaming which increased over 30 reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and increased sales of our Maxwellbased GPU products Revenue from Tesla GPUs for Datacenter increased driven by strong demand from cloud service providers Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization declined due to weakness in the overall workstation market Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to last year 34 Table of Contents GPU business revenue increased by 11 in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 This increase was due primarily to higher revenue from GeForce GPU products and associated memory for gaming which increased over 30 reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and increased sales of our Maxwellbased GPU products Revenue from Tesla for Datacenter computing increased due to large project wins with cloud service providers and revenue from our NVIDIA GRID virtualization products also increased as this platform gained momentum Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to fiscal year 2014 Tegra Processor Business Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 3 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 This decrease was driven by a decline in sales of Tegra products for OEM smartphones and tablets of almost 90 partially offset by an increase in sales of Tegra products serving automotive systems of almost 75 Revenue also grew from development services and sales of SHIELD devices Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 45 in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 This increase was driven by higher sales of Tegra products serving automotive infotainment systems OEM smartphones and tablet devices and the onset of SHIELD tablet sales in fiscal year 2015 All Other License revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with Intel in January 2011 was flat at 264 million for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 The final payment under this arrangement was received in January 2016 and will be recognized as revenue into the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 79 of total revenue for fiscal year 2016 and 75 of total revenue for both fiscal year 2015 and 2014 Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location Revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized as follows Year Ended January 31 2016 January 25 2015 January 26 2014 Revenue Customer A 11 11 11 Customer B 9 9 10 35 Table of Contents Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing Gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue Our overall gross margin was 561 555 and 549 for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively The increase over these fiscal years was driven primarily by a richer product mix in our GPU business partially offset by lower Tegra business margins Charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 112 million 59 million and 50 million for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 22 13 and 12 respectively Sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 32 million for both fiscal year 2016 and 2015 and 43 million for fiscal year 2014 favorably impacting our gross margin by 06 07 and 11 respectively As a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 16 06 and 01 in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows GPU Business The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2016 when compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to a richer product mix resulting from stronger sales of our GeForce GPU products for gaming and lower sales of GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 due to richer product mix resulting from strong sales of highend GeForce GTX GPU products based on our Maxwell architecture and the volume increase in our Tesla accelerated computing products Tegra Processor Business The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business decreased during fiscal year 2016 when compared to fiscal year 2015 due to inventory provisions the warranty charge associated with the SHIELD 8inch tablet product recall and a less rich product mix resulting from higher automotive and SHIELD product sales and lower sales of OEM smartphone and tablet products The inventory provisions related primarily to older generation Tegra products as well as inventory purchase commitments in excess of estimated demand and excess component inventories for SHIELD products The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business decreased during fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014 These decreases were driven primarily by a combination of an overall decline in margins of our Tegra products and a less rich mix between tablet products which have had higher gross margins and smartphone and automotive module products which have had comparably lower gross margins 36 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Year Ended Year Ended January 31 2016

development expenses decreased by 2 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 This decrease was primarily driven by the winddown of Icera modem operations and other organization efficiencies partially offset by increases in employee compensation and related costs including stockbased compensation expense Research and development expenses remained relatively flat during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 Compensation and benefits increased by 57 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense Offsetting this increase was a 39 million decrease in engineering development expenses Sales General and Administrative Sales general and administrative expenses increased by 25 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 Outside professional fees increased primarily due to 70 million of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm Compensation and benefits increased by 39 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense Advertising and promotions increased by 9 million resulting from higher print and digital advertising Sales general and administrative expenses increased by 10 in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 Compensation and benefits increased by 54 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense Facilities costs increased by 10 million as we expanded our offices internationally and leased an office building within the boundaries of our main Santa Clara campus Offsetting these increases were a decrease in outside professional fees of 9 million as well as more favorable international taxes and government subsidies 37 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Charges In May 2015 we announced our intent to wind down our Icera modem operations and that we were open to a sale of the technology or operations We pursued the sale of Iceras technology and operations but were unable to identify a viable buyer with genuine interest As a result we began the winddown of Icera modem operations in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 The winddown of Icera modem operations allows for continued investment in strategic growth areas including our growth initiatives of deep learning selfdriving cars and gaming Our operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included 131 million of restructuring and other charges as follows Year Ended January 31 2016 In millions Employee severance and related costs 82 Tax subsidy impairment 17 Fixed assets impairment 18 Facilities and related costs 9 Other exit costs 5 Restructuring and other charges 131 We expect to incur additional restructuring charges to operating expense of approximately 1 million to 2 million per quarter for each of the first two quarters of fiscal year 2017 after which we expect the restructuring to be substantially complete Please refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further discussion Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 Interest income was 39 million 28 million and 17 million in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively The increase in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to higher average cash balances invested in interest bearing securities as well as higher purchased yields The increase in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to higher average cash balances as we invested the proceeds from the convertible notes we issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 in interest bearing securities Interest expense was 47 million 46 million and 10 million in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively The increases in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 compared to fiscal years 2015 and 2014 respectively were primarily due to coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the convertible notes we issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 Other Income and Expense Other income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities sales or impairments of investments in nonaffiliated companies and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates Net other income was 4 million 14 million and 7 million in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively The decrease for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to less gain recognized from sales of nonaffiliated investments and more losses from foreign currency remeasurement The increase for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain from the sale of a nonaffiliated investment partially offset by the recognition of an impairment loss of a nonaffiliated investment and losses from foreign currency remeasurement 38 Table of Contents Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of 129 million 124 million and 70 million during fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively Our annual effective tax rate was 173 165 and 138 in fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively The difference in the effective tax rates amongst the three years was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 partially offset by a net income tax benefit related to the Icera modem restructuring in fiscal year 2016 and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014 Our effective tax rate for each of the fiscal years was lower than the United States federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate is lower than the United States federal statutory tax rate of 35 favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the US federal research tax credit and favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of

equivalents and marketable securities is managed on our behalf by several financial institutions which are required to follow our investment policy which requires the purchase of high grade investment securities the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to changes in working capital and higher noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation and restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2016 partially offset by a decline in net income Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to higher net income from revenue growth and contained operating expenses partially offset by an increase in inventories resulting from the introduction of newly launched Maxwellbased GPUs and certain Tegra SOCs and SHIELD devices and an increase in accounts receivable Cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to higher proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and lower purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2015 decreased from fiscal year 2014 primarily due to lower purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets Cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to lower share repurchases partially offset by higher dividends Cash was provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to net proceeds of 148 billion from the convertible note offering we completed partially offset by net proceeds of 108 million from the related note hedge and warrant transactions 39 Table of Contents Liquidity Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations Our investment portfolio consists principally of cash and cash equivalents debt securities of corporations and United States government and its agencies assetbacked securities mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and foreign government bonds These investments are denominated in United States dollars As of January 31 2016 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities Please refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information As of January 31 2016 and January 25 2015 we had 504 billion and 462 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities and the diversification of asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration as specified in our investment policy guidelines These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer or type of instrument As of January 31 2016 we were in compliance with our investment policy As of January 31 2016 our investments in US government agencies and US government sponsored enterprises represented 47 of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for 23 of our total investment portfolio All of our investments are with AA3 or better rated securities We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 31 2016 Based on our quarterly impairment review we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and did not record any impairment during fiscal year 2016 Net realized gains were 2 million for both fiscal year 2016 and 2014 and were not significant for fiscal year 2015 As of January 31 2016 the amount of our net unrealized gain was not significant As of January 25 2015 we had a net unrealized gain of 8 million which was comprised of gross unrealized gains of 11 million offset by 3 million of gross unrealized losses Our accounts receivable are highly concentrated One customer accounted for 21 of our accounts receivable balance as of January 31 2016 We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside of the United States As of January 31 2016 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 13 billion held within the United States and 37 billion held outside of the United States Most of the amounts held outside the United States may be repatriated to the United States but under current law would be subject to US federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits Further repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws As of January 31 2016 we have not provided for US federal and state income taxes on approximately 25 billion of undistributed earnings of nonUnited States subsidiaries as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States Although we have no current need to do so if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the United States we would incur US federal and state income tax less applicable foreign tax credits and reduced by the current amount of our US federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards Further in addition to the 13 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the United States and available to fund our US operations and any other US cash needs we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the United States other than by repatriation of foreign earnings where US income tax may otherwise be due Accordingly we do not reasonably expect any material effect on our business as a whole or to our financial flexibility with respect to our current cash balances held outside of the United States Dividend payments and any share repurchases must be made from cash held in the United States For fiscal year 2016 we made total cash dividend payments of 213 million and repurchased 587 million of our common stock utilizing a significant amount of our US cash balance previously taxed as of January 31 2016 40 Table of Contents Convertible Notes On December 2 2013 we issued 150 billion of 100 Convertible Senior Notes or the Notes due in 2018 and concurrently entered into separate note hedge and warrant transactions The Notes will mature on December 1 2018 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date As of January 31 2016 the conversion threshold had been met and the Notes became convertible at the holders option beginning on February 1 2016 and ending May 1 2016 As such the 141 billion carrying value of the Notes was classified as a current liability and the 87 million difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Notes was reclassified from shareholders equity to convertible debt in the mezzanine equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31 2016 and will remain there for as long as the Notes are convertible The determination of whether or not the Notes are convertible must continue to be performed on a quarterly basis Consequently the Notes may be reclassified as longterm debt if the conversion threshold is not met in future quarters Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further discussion Capital Return to Shareholders During fiscal year 2016 we repurchased a total of 25 million shares for 587 million and paid 213 million in cash dividends to our shareholders equivalent to 0085 per share for the three months ended April 26 2015 00975 per share for the six months ended October 25 2015 and 0115 per share for the three months ended January 31 2016 As a result we returned 800 million to shareholders during fiscal year 2016 in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments For fiscal 2017 we intend to return approximately 10 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our Boards continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further discussion Operating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements We believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition share repurchase cash dividend and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months However there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent shareholders We also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business Factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include decreased demand and market acceptance for our products andor our customers products inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our nextgeneration products competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors We expect to spend approximately 100 million to 150 million for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2017 primarily for facilities emulation equipment computers and engineering workstations 41 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 31 2016 Payment Due By Period Contractual Obligations

titled OffBalance Sheet Arrangements for additional information 4 Represents unrecognized tax benefits of 78 million which consists of 67 million plus the related interest and penalties of 11 million recorded in noncurrent income tax payable as of January 31 2016 We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability or interestpenalty payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions 5 Our operating expenses for the fiscal year 2016 included 131 million of restructuring and other charges related to the winddown of our Icera modem operations The 23 million represents the remaining balance of the restructuring liability as of January 31 2016 OffBalance Sheet Arrangements During fiscal year 2016 we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara California which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 We are financing this construction under an offbalance sheet buildtosuit operating lease arrangement The banks have committed to fund up to 380 million of costs relating to construction Once construction is complete the lease balance will remain static at the completed cost for the remaining duration of the lease term During construction accrued interest will be capitalized into the lease balance Following construction we will pay rent in the form of interest The lease has an initial 75 year term expiring on December 19 2022 consisting of an approximately 25 year construction period followed by a 5 year lease term We have the option to renew this lease for up to three additional 5 year periods subject to approval by the banks During the term of the lease we may elect to purchase the headquarters building for the amount of the banks investment in the building and any accrued but unpaid rent At the end of the lease term we may elect to buy the building for the outstanding balance on the maturity date or arrange for the cash sale of the building to an unaffiliated third party The aggregate guarantee made by us under the lease is no more than 875 of the costs incurred in connection with the construction of the building Please refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further discussion regarding our operating lease financing arrangement During fiscal years 2015 and 2014 we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation SK 303a4ii 42 Table of Contents Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Please see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk As of January 31 2016 and January 25 2015 we had 504 billion and 462 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities As of January 31 2016 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities As of January 31 2016 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments According to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of 28 million Investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall Due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates However because any debt securities we hold are classified as availableforsale no gains or losses are realized in our Consolidated Statements of Income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be otherthantemporary Other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances Volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them As of January 31 2016 our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented 47 of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for 23 of our total investment portfolio Substantially all of our investments are with AA3 or better rated securities If the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 2 5 the fair values of these investments could decline by approximately 66 million 164 million On December 2 2013 we issued 150 billion of 100 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 or the Notes Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets Since the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates However the fair value of the Notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates During fiscal year 2016 we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara California which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 We are financing this construction under an offbalance sheet buildtosuit operating lease financing arrangement Following construction we will pay rent in the form of interest that is based on a variable interest rate and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates In order to mitigate the interest rate risk on the operating lease financing arrangement in August 2015 we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement which entitles us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates Please refer to Notes 9 and 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information If the syndicate of banks that are participants to the operating lease financing arrangement were to fail to fund loans for any reason we would remain liable for payments due under the swap unless we were to settle the swap If we were to settle the swap at a time when interest rates have fallen relative to the swaps inception the price to settle the swap could be significant 43 Table of Contents Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in Other income net in our Consolidated Financial Statements and to date have not been significant The impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income was not significant for both fiscal year 2016 and 2015 and was a gain of 5 million for fiscal year 2014 Sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete Conversely decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us Additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than US dollars Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar We may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates There were no forward exchange contracts outstanding as of January 31 2016 ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The information required by

not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud A control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only

consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15a1 present fairly in all material respects the financial position of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries at January 31 2016 and January 25 2015 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America In addition in our opinion the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15a2 presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements Also in our opinion the Company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements on the financial statement schedule and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects Our audits of the financial statements included examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet in fiscal year 2016 A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate s PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose California March 16 2016 49 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME In millions except

Significant Accounting Policies Our Company NVIDIA is dedicated to advancing visual computing NVIDIA has transformed into a specialized platform company that targets four large markets Gaming Professional Visualization Datacenter and Automotive where visual computing is essential and valued Our two reportable segments GPU and Tegra Processor are based on a single underlying graphics architecture From our proprietary processors we have created platforms that address the four large markets where our visual computing expertise is critically important We are focused on delivering value through PC mobile and cloud architectures Our vertical integration enables us to bring together hardware system software programmable algorithms systems and services to create unique value for the markets we serve Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers Quadro for designers Tesla for researchers and analysts focused on artificial intelligence deep learning and bigdata and GRID for cloudbased visual computing users We also integrate our GPUs into powerful mobile systemonachip SOC processors which drive supercomputing capabilities for tablets and online gaming and entertainment devices as well as autonomous robots drones and cars Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip incorporating GPUs and multicore CPUs with audio video and inputoutput capabilities Headquartered in Santa Clara California NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998 All references to NVIDIA we us our or the Company mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries except where it is made clear that the term means only the parent company Fiscal Year We operate on a 52 or a 53week year ending on the last Sunday in January Fiscal year 2016 was a 53week year with the extra week in the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were 52week years Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and its whollyowned subsidiaries All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ from those estimates On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation litigation investigation and settlement costs restructuring and other charges and other contingencies These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 56 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Revenue Recognition Product Revenue We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured For most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer At the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment For sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and in some cases when customer return rights lapse Our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue Our customer programs also include marketing development funds or MDFs MDFs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or OEMs distributors addin card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF programs We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns License and Development Revenue For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed For most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project A provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue Royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties We recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee 57 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Restructuring and Other Charges Our restructuring and other charges include employee severance and related costs the writedown of assets and other exit costs The severance and related costs include onetime termination benefits as well as certain statutory termination benefits or employee terminations under ongoing benefit arrangements Onetime termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees unless employees must provide future service in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period Ongoing termination benefits arrangements are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefits becomes estimable and payment is probable Any contract termination costs are recognized at estimated fair value when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms Other associated costs are recognized in the period the liability is incurred Advertising Expenses We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 were 17 million 15 million and 13 million respectively Rent Expense We recognize rent expense on a straightline basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred but not paid Product Warranties We generally offer limited warranty to endusers that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition Under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated Stockbased Compensation We estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and recognize the expense using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or RSUs and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or PSUs and we use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased PSUs The compensation expense for stock options RSUs and marketbased PSUs is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or ESPP using the BlackScholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year Stockbased compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model Litigation Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters However there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments If that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with US GAAP However the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 58 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at endofperiod exchange rates Nonmonetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in Other income net in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant The impact of gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement included in determining other income net was not significant for both fiscal year 2016 and 2015 and was a gain of 5 million for fiscal year 2014 Income Taxes We recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonUS subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly As of January 31 2016 we had a valuation allowance of 272 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period We recognize excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation as a credit to shareholders equity if and when realized In determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to utilize the withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits We have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operations We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense Please refer to Note 13 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income loss Other comprehensive income loss components include unrealized gains losses on availableforsale securities and the net change in fair value of our interest rate swap net of tax 59 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method Under the treasury stock method the effect of stock options outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is antidilutive Additionally we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that requires us upon conversion to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock Our convertible notes note hedges and related warrants contain various conversion features which are further described in Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the convertible notes and warrants under the treasury stock method will be included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion is dilutive However unless actually exercised the note hedges will not be included in the calculation of diluted net income per share as their preexercised effect would be antidilutive under the treasury stock method Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents As of January 31 2016 and January 25 2015 our cash and cash equivalents were 596 million and 497 million respectively including 43 million and 132 million respectively invested in money market funds Marketable Securities Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as availableforsale These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of shareholders equity net of tax The fair value of interestbearing securities includes accrued interest Any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income and expense section of our Consolidated Statements of Income Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income and expense section of our Consolidated Statements of Income All of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments If the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument In these situations we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value For availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 60 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 31 2016 and January 25 2015 Marketable securities are comprised of availableforsale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of shareholders equity net of tax Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges the gains losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged For derivative instruments designated as cashflow hedges the effective portion of the gains losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents marketable securities accounts receivable note hedge and interest rate swap Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities the diversification of asset type and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration All marketable securities are held in our name managed by several investment managers and held by one major financial institution under a custodial arrangement Accounts receivable from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total accounts receivable aggregated approximately 21 of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 31 2016 and 30 of our account receivable balance from two customers as of January 25 2015 We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments We determine this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout and shipping costs as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions Once inventory has been writtenoff or writtendown it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently writtenup Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets generally three to five years Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and a gain or loss is recorded The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to twenty five years Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 61 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist For the purposes of completing our impairment test we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis For those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred where potential impairment indicators exist or for which we have not performed a quantitative assessment recently we utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach The second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities Please refer to Note 4 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Intangible Assets Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses patents acquired intellectual property trademarks and customer relationships and are subject to an annual impairment test We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from one to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern cannot be reliably determined using a straightline amortization method Impairment of LongLived Assets Longlived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations We account for asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs As of January 31 2016 and January 25 2015 our asset retirement obligations to return the leasehold improvements at our headquarters facility and certain laboratories at our domestic and international facilities to their original condition upon lease termination were 2 million and 7 million respectively Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board or FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases The objective of the update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with a lease term of more than 12 months In addition the update will require additional disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements Under existing guidance operating leases are not recorded as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements however we expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets 62 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued In November 2015 the FASB issued an accounting standards update to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities along with any related valuation allowance be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period Early adoption is permitted and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively We adopted this update in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 on a prospective basis Prior reporting periods were not retrospectively adjusted The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income In July 2015 the FASB issued an accounting standards update for the subsequent measurement of inventory The amended guidance requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation The requirement would replace the current lower of cost or market evaluation The update is effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted to be applied prospectively The adoption of this accounting guidance is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements In April 2015 the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires an entity to present debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability as opposed to an asset Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense The update is effective for annual reporting periods including interim reporting periods within those periods beginning after December 15 2015 Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued and the new guidance would be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2017 The adoption of this accounting guidance is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements In April 2015 the FASB issued an accounting standards update that provides clarification on whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license If a software license is included the customer should account for the license consistent with its accounting for other software licenses If a software license is not included the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract The update is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15 2015 with early adoption permitted Companies can elect to adopt the standard update prospectively or retrospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2017 We expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in software license assets and related depreciation expense and a corresponding decrease in prepaid service contract assets and related service contract expense in our consolidated financial statements In May 2014 the FASB issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under US GAAP for all companies in all industries effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period On July 9 2015 the FASB voted to defer the effective date by one year such that the new standard will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 The FASB will also permit entities to adopt the standard one year earlier if they choose ie the original effective date We will adopt this guidance either by using a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined which transition method we will apply 63

achievement versus the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year Of the total fair value of equity awards we estimated that the stockbased compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expected to vest for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 was 46 million 37 million and 30 million respectively 64 Table of

period to the purchase date The riskfree interest rate assumption used to value stock options and ESPP is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term of the award Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility For awards granted subsequent to November 7 2012 we use the dividend yield at grant date Our RSU PSU and marketbased PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair values of RSUs PSUs and marketbased PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield Additionally for employee stock option RSU PSU and marketbased PSU awards we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates

further discussion regarding segments We utilized a twostep quantitative analysis to complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach The second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities These income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business When performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions The market method of determining the fair value of our reporting units requires us to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market

Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Note 9 Derivative Financial Instrument In August 2015 we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement for our new headquarters building which entitles us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates The objective of this interest rate swap is to mitigate variability in the benchmark interest rate on the first 200 million of existing operating lease financing payments This interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge will have settlements beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 and will terminate in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 Gains or losses on this swap are currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and will subsequently be recorded in earnings at the point when the related operating lease financing expense begins to affect earnings or if ineffectiveness of the swap should occur As of January 31 2016 accumulated other comprehensive income loss includes a 7 million loss due to the decrease in fair value of the interest rate swap A summary of the notional amount and fair value of the interest rate swap recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at January 31 2016 and January 25 2015 is as follows in

an ongoing basis whether the interest rate swap is highly effective For the year ended January 31 2016 the interest rate swap was determined to be highly effective and there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness The effect of the interest rate swap on other comprehensive income loss net of tax is as follows in millions January 31 2016 January 25 2015 Cash Flow Hedge Gain loss

Notes The Notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations of the Company which pay interest in cash semiannually at a rate of 100 per annum The Notes will mature on December 1 2018 unless repurchased or converted prior to such date The Notes were initially convertible at a rate of 495958 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of Notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of 201630 per share of common stock The conversion rate and conversion price are adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events including our cash dividends or distributions exceeding 0085 per share Accordingly as of January 31 2016 the initial conversion rate has been adjusted to 497009 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of Notes equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of 201204 per share of common stock for dividend increases made to that date Holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at their option at any time prior to August 1 2018 only under the following circumstances 1 during any fiscal quarter and only during such fiscal quarter if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day 2 during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price per 1000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day or 3 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events On or after August 1 2018 to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes regardless of the foregoing conditions The price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of our fiscal quarter ended January 31 2016 Therefore as of January 31 2016 the conversion threshold had been met and the Notes became convertible at the holders option beginning on February 1 2016 and ending May 1 2016 As such the 141 billion carrying value of the Notes was classified as a current liability and the 87 million difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of the Notes was reclassified from shareholders equity to convertible debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31 2016 and will remain there for as long as the Notes are convertible The determination of whether or not the Notes are convertible must continue to be performed on a quarterly basis Consequently the Notes may be reclassified as longterm debt and the convertible debt conversion obligation may be reclassified within shareholders equity if the conversion threshold is not met in future quarters If the notes are converted we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes We may pay or deliver cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election in respect of the remainder if any of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted Based on the 2929 closing price of our common stock on January 29 2016 the last trading day of fiscal year 2016 the ifconverted value of our Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately 684 million Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction or the Note Hedges structured to offset the potential common stock dilution andor offset potential cash payments to settle our excess conversion obligation Cashsettled convertible debt is separated into debt and equity components at issuance and is assigned a fair value The value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value as of the issuance date of a similar debt without the conversion feature The difference between the net cash proceeds and this estimated fair value represents the value assigned to the equity component and is recorded as a debt discount The debt discount is amortized using the effective interest method from the origination date through its stated contractual maturity date 78 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued The initial debt component of the Notes was valued at 135 billion based on the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate market rate for a nonconvertible debt at the date of issuance which was determined to be 315 The carrying value of the permanent equity component reported in additional paidincapital was valued at 126 million and recorded as a debt discount This amount together with the 23 million purchasers discount to the par value of the Notes represents the total unamortized debt discount of 148 million we recorded at the time of issuance of the Notes The aggregate debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Notes using the effective interest method using an interest rate of 315 As of January 31 2016 after reclassifying 87 million from the shareholders equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet to convertible debt conversion obligation in the mezzanine equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet the remaining carrying value of the equity component in the shareholders equity section of our Consolidated

Notes were approximately 148 billion after payment of the initial purchasers discount Concurrently with the offering of the Notes we entered into Note Hedges with a strike price equal to the initial conversion price of the Notes or 201630 per share Adjusting for dividends paid through January 31 2016 the conversion price of the Notes has been adjusted to 201204 per share The Note Hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock andor cash related to the excess conversion value that we would deliver andor pay respectively to the holders of the Notes upon conversion We paid 167 million for the Note Hedges In addition concurrent with the offering of the Notes and the purchase of the Note Hedges we entered into a separate warrant transaction or the Warrants with an initial strike price to the holders of the Warrants of 271425 per share Under the terms of the Warrants the strike price is adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events including our cash dividends or distributions that deviate from 0085 per share Accordingly as of January 31 2016 the strike price was adjusted to 270851 per share reflecting adjustments for our dividend increases made to that date The Warrants are net share settled and cover subject to customary antidilution adjustments 74 million shares of our common stock We received 59 million for the Warrants transaction The 108 million net cost of the Note Hedges offset by the proceeds from the Warrants was included as a net reduction to additional paidin capital in the shareholders equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets 79 Table of Contents

court granted the motion to stay on October 23 2014 On November 10 2014 Samsung filed a complaint against NVIDIA and Velocity Micro Inc in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that NVIDIA infringed six patents and falsely advertised that the Tegra K1 processor is the worlds fastest mobile processor Samsung amended its complaint twice first on December 19 2014 and then on April 10 2015 without changing its legal claims Samsung seeks monetary damages and certain injunctive relief as to some of the asserted patents NVIDIA answered the second amended complaint on April 16 2015 and asserted counterclaims against Samsung for infringing four of NVIDIAs patents and for noninfringement and invalidity of the six patents asserted in Samsungs second

not seek to review the findings of infringement and validity of all three patents the ITC may issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order under one or more of the patents The innovations claimed in these patents are minor and insignificant to the performance of our products Based on our plans to modify certain impacted products and certain distribution operations in the United States we do not believe that the possible entry of these orders will have a significant impact to our business The target date for the final determination by the ITC is April 25 2016 followed by the Presidential Review Period ending June 24 2016 NVIDIA and Samsung have also challenged the validity of certain of each others patents through inter partes review before the United States Patent

three years was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 partially offset by a net income tax benefit related to the Icera modem restructuring in fiscal year 2016 and a higher percentage of research tax credit benefit in fiscal year 2014 Our effective tax rate for each of the fiscal years was lower than the US federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate is lower than the United States federal statutory tax rate of 35 favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the US federal research tax credit and favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations As of January 31 2016 and January 25 2015 we had a valuation allowance of 272 million and 261 million respectively related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period Our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased

have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in our foreign subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable As of January 31 2016 we had 230 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 202 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized However approximately 50 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken that if recognized would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance The 202 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31 2016 consisted of 67 million recorded in noncurrent income taxes payable and 135 million reflected as a reduction to the related

is classified as a longterm liability or reduction of longterm deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense As of January 31 2016 January 25 2015 and January 26 2014 we had accrued 11 million 14 million and 13 million respectively for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits As of January 31 2016 noncurrent income taxes payable of 78 million consisted of unrecognized tax benefits of 67 million and the related interest and penalties of 11 million While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position Accordingly our provisions on federal state and foreign taxrelated matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved As of January 31 2016 we do not believe that our estimates as

chief operating decision maker or CODM reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments We report our business in two primary reportable segments the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business based on a single underlying graphics architecture Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets include GeForce for gamers Quadro for designers Tesla for researchers and analysts focused on artificial intelligence deep learning and bigdata and GRID for cloudbased visual computing users We also integrate our GPUs into powerful mobile systemonachip SOC processors which drive supercomputing capabilities for tablets and online gaming and entertainment devices as well as autonomous robots drones and cars Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip incorporating GPUs and multicore CPUs with audio video and inputoutput capabilities We have a single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors This architecture unification leverages our visual computing expertise by charging the
