ContentsITEM 1A RISK FACTORSIn evaluating NVIDIA and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10K Before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below Any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline Additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our businessRisks Related to Our Business Industry and PartnersIf we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets identify new products services or technologies or successfully compete in our target markets our revenue and financial results will be adversely impactedNVIDIAbranded solutions and services are visual computing and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets Gaming Professional Visualization Datacenter and Automotive Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to meet the evolving needs of these markets and to enhance our existing products services and technologies In addition our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry trends and to develop new products services and technologies Our existing markets and products and new markets and products may require a considerable investment of technical financial compliance sales and marketing resources We are currently devoting significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where our operating history is less extensive such as the automotive marketWe cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities our business will be harmed In addition if demand for products and services from these growth markets is below our expectations if we fail to achieve consumer or market acceptance of them or if we are not able to develop these products and services in a cost effective or efficient manner we may not realize benefits from our strategy Our target markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve and new competitors enter these markets If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets including in significant international markets such as China demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer Our competitors products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or different features than ours In addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets or introduce new offerings in light of the competitive environment our results of operations could sufferIf our products fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields our financial results could be adversely impactedManufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry As a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem Because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers and partners Lower than expected yields could harm customer or partner relationships and our financial results14Table of ContentsSystem security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputationSecurity breaches computer malware and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future Experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time For portions of our IT infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems Data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systemsActual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful We may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions Delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputationIf our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market shareOur products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system Our products are used by a variety of industries including the automotive industry Failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs ODMs AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue In addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins and harm our relationships with customers and partners and consumers perceptions of our brand Also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field A product recall particularly an automotive recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits If a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business Further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial resultsIf we do not replace our Intel licensing revenues our financial results may be adversely affected In January 2011 we entered into a patent cross licensing agreement under which Intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of 150 billion over six years The final 200 million payment under this agreement was received in January 2016 We will be recognizing revenue under this agreement through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 If we do not enter into new licensing agreements or if the Intel agreement is not offset by other growth in income our financial results may be adversely affected15Table of ContentsWe depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our businessWe do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility Instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques Similarly we do not assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc BYD Auto Co Ltd Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd JSI Logistics Ltd King Yuan Electronics Co and Siliconware Precision Industries Co Ltd We do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors As a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results includinga lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraintsa failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our productsa failure to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as 16nm FinFET and memory designs such as CoWoS needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basisloss of a supplier and additional expense andor production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a suppliera lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality anddelays in product shipments shortages a decrease in product quality andor higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors orders over our orders or otherwiseWe also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner In the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could declineIf we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmedFor our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor Our OEM ODM and AIB and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows If OEMs ODMs and AIB and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration In order to achieve design wins we mustanticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demandincorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers andprice our products competitivelyUnanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers Further if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies 16Table of ContentsBusiness disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costsOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages outages at cloud service providers tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in Asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity In addition a majority of our principal IT datacenters are located in California making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area The manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including Taiwan China and Korea Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues The ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown In the event of a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event our revenue could decline and our business may be harmedWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose any of these customersWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network With several of these partners we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels  As a result revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was 12 11 and 11 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors In the future these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly becausemost of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penaltyour partners may develop their own solutionsour customers may purchase products from our competitors orour partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our productsThe loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial conditionWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers In the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficientOur gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross marginOur gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products sold average selling prices introduction of new products and services process node transitions product transitions sales discounts pricing actions by our competitors the cost of product components and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products We are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate the impact of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee our gross margins may be negatively impacted17Table of ContentsIf we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmedWe manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize In estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory includechanges in business and economic conditions including downturns in our target markets andor overall economychanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit marketa sudden and significant decrease in demand for our productsa higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirementsour introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products less demand than expected for newlyintroduced products orincreased competition including competitive pricing actionsIn addition the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins In addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals We could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial resultsConversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis Even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner If we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damagedWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our businessWe conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and Other Americas  We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers outside the United States and Other Americas Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 80 79 and 75 of total revenue for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively  The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties includinginternational economic and political conditions such as political tensions between countries in which we do businessunexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements  differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practiceslocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulationsexporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions financial risks such as longer payment cycles difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and foreign exchange rate fluctuations andincreased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations such as carbon taxes fuel or energy taxes and pollution limitsIf sales to any of our customers outside of the United States and Other Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted18Table of ContentsWe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our productsWe have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business Any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial resultsdifficulty in combining the technology products operations or workforce of the acquired business with our businessdiversion of capital and other resources including managements attentionassumption of liabilitiesincurring amortization expenses impairment charges to goodwill or writedowns of acquired assetspotential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality architecture and development or legal and financial contingencies among other things andimpairment of relationships with or loss of our or our targets employees vendors and customers as a result of our acquisition or investmentRisks Related to Regulatory Legal Our Common Stock and Other MattersActions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our productsWe have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive reliefWe may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results Further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third partys patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third partys patent or other intellectual property rights However we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted Furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating resultsWe rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections19Table of ContentsOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could declineOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors For example our operating expenses represent a significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period In particular our research and development expenses reflect multiyear programs for the development of new products and enhancements that will not result in revenue if any until future periods Therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performanceFactors that could affect our results of operations in the future includedemand and market acceptance for our products and services andor our customers productsthe successful development and volume production of our nextgeneration productsour inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multiyear development cycle for some of our products and servicesnew product and service announcements or product and service introductions by our competitorsour introduction of new products in accordance with OEMs design requirements and design cycleschanges in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays

macroeconomic events and factors affecting the overall semiconductor industry and our target marketsAny one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility and as a result investors may suffer lossesIn the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities We have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation Such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business In addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results20Table of ContentsPrivacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and servicesOur products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating resultsWorldwide regulatory authorities are considering various legislative proposals concerning data protection In addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices If so we may be ordered to change our data practices andor be fined Complying with these changing laws could cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations We are subject to risks associated with development and construction of our headquarters building under an operating lease financing arrangementIn fiscal year 2016 we began to construct a new headquarters building in Santa Clara California which is currently targeted for completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 We may encounter unanticipated occurrences or conditions during construction that may increase the expense of the project We may also encounter unanticipated delays in the construction of the new building and final city approval for occupancy may be delayed We are financing this construction under an operating lease arrangement described below Delays and cost overruns during construction could result in a default under the operating lease financing arrangement which could result in liabilities and expenses and could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operationsAdditionally any such difficulties could result in our default under the operative agreements entered into with a syndicate of banks that are participants to the operating lease financing arrangement to finance development and construction of our headquarters  We have pledged our assets that relate to the new headquarters building in order to secure our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement We will need to maintain compliance with the requirements governing such agreements including compliance with financial and other covenants certain of which may be subject to events outside of our control If we fail to comply with the covenants we may be unable to obtain or utilize all or a portion of the financing contemplated by the operating lease financing arrangement Further noncompliance with such covenants or other event of default could lead to a termination of our lease of the property and the lenders could have the right to among other things foreclose on the collateral for our obligations under the operating lease financing arrangement A loss of financing for the new headquarters building or foreclosure on the collateral could adversely affect our liquidity and businessOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligationsIn September 2016 we issued 100 billion of 220 notes due September 16 2021 or the Notes Due 2021 and 100 billion of 320 notes due September 16 2026 or the Notes Due 2026 collectively the Notes In December 2013 we issued 150 billion of 100 convertible senior notes due December 1 2018 or the Convertible Notes of which 827 million in principal amount remained outstanding as of January 29 2017 We have received additional conversion requests of 660 million in principal amount 502 million of which have already settled 103 million of which are expected to settle during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and 55 million of which are expected to settle during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018Our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes Additionally our obligation to make payments related to the Notes or the Convertible Notes could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and other general corporate purposes21Table of ContentsThe warrants associated with our Convertible Notes or the Warrants dilute our net income per share and the settlement or eventual exercise of the Warrants would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholdersWhen the average trading price of our common stock for a fiscal quarter exceeds the adjusted strike price of the Warrants the number of diluted weighted average shares used in our net income per share calculation increases which dilutes our net income per share Any issuance by us of shares upon exercise or any other settlement of the Warrants may dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders In December 2016 we entered into an agreement with a counterparty bank to terminate 63 million of the 75 million Warrants outstanding In consideration for the termination of these Warrants we delivered a total of 48 million shares of common stock to the counterparty bank the amount of which was determined each day based on the daily volumeweighted average price of our common stock during an observation period beginning December 13 2016 and ending January 31 2017 As of January 29 2017 44 million of the 48 million shares of our common stock had been issued related to the terminated Warrants The remaining 4 million shares were issued in the beginning of fiscal year 2018 An aggregate of 12 million Warrants remained outstanding or the Remaining Warrants as of January 29 2017 The Remaining Warrants will be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between March 2019 and June 2019 unless the Warrant holder notifies us otherwiseDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in controlOur status as a Delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders In addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock These provisions include the followingthe ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approvalthe prohibition of shareholder action by written consentadvance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposalsthe ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approvala supermajority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylawsthe inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders andthe ability of our Board of Directors to make amend or repeal our bylawsOn March 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox Under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire22Table of ContentsITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable ITEM 2 PROPERTIESOur

basis to 014 per share or 056 on an annual basis In fiscal years 2017 and 2016 we paid 261 million and 213 million respectively in cash dividends to our common shareholders Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under the program are subject to continued capital availability and our Board of Directors continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of NVIDIA applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends In calendar year 2016 based upon our earnings and profits 60 of our dividend payments were considered to be a return of capital for US federal income tax purposes It is possible that a portion of our dividend payments in future calendar years may continue to be considered a return of capital for US federal income tax purposesIssuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesBeginning August 2004 our Board of Directors authorized us subject to certain specifications to repurchase shares of our common stock On November 7 2016 the Board authorized an additional 200 billion under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020 Through January 29 2017 we have repurchased an aggregate of 245 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of 459 billion All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock As of January 29 2017 we were authorized subject to certain specifications to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to 273 billion through December 2020 For fiscal year 2018 we intend to return 125 billion to our shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases24Table of

year 2017 grew 38 to 691 billion reflecting growth in each of our market platforms  Gaming Professional Visualization Datacenter and Automotive GPU business revenue was 582 billion up 39 from a year earlier led by growth in our GeForce GPU gaming and datacenter platforms GeForce GPU gaming growth was fueled by strong adoption of our latest Pascal architecture Datacenter growth reflected strong demand for deep learning training cloud and virtualized computing and sales of our new DGX1 supercomputer Tegra business revenue was 824 million up 47 from a year ago led by growth in automotive primarily from infotainment modules and gaming development platforms and servicesGross margin for fiscal year 2017 was 588 compared with 561 a year earlier reflecting the growth of GeForce gaming GPUs the growth of our GPU computing platforms for cloud deep learning AI and graphics virtualization and decreased sales volumes of lower margin products Operating expenses for fiscal year 2017 were 213 billion up from 206 billion in the previous year This reflects growth in headcount and related costs partially offset by lower litigation and restructuring expensesNet income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2017 were 167 billion and 257 respectively up 171 and 138 respectively from a year earlier These increases were fueled by strong revenue growth improved gross and operating margins and a lower effective income tax rate as a result of a decrease in the amount of earnings subject to United States tax and the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard related to the simplification of certain aspects of stockbased compensation accounting We returned 100 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2017 through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends and we intend to return approximately 125 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2018 Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 680 billion as of January 29

integrates Google Assistant for TV SmartThings Hub technology and the NVIDIA SPOT AI micCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or US GAAP The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilitiesWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10KRevenue RecognitionProduct RevenueWe recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured For sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and in some cases when customer return rights lapseOur customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor While we have a long history of rebate arrangements with OEMs we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual OEMs In such cases the OEMs may not be our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix of demand they place on their CEMsODMs may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings In addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents less than 05 of total revenue30Table of ContentsOur customer programs also include marketing development funds or MDFs MDFs represent monies paid to retailers system builders OEMs distributors addin card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products Depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns License and Development RevenueFor license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed For most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project We periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total cost Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any periodFor license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue Please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional informationInventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditionsSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition In addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory Also we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 02 16 and 06 in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively The charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal years were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products As a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand In doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints We also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions all of which may impact demand for our productsPlease refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion31Table of ContentsIncome TaxesWe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realizedUnited States income tax has not been provided for a portion of earnings of our nonUS subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvestedOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordinglyAs of January 29 2017 we had a valuation allowance of 353 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the periodGoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value We have identified two reporting units GPU and Tegra Processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis Goodwill assigned to  the GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units as of January 29 2017 was 210 million and 408 million respectively Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertainDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 we elected to use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit In applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our businessWhen performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions Our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance Additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance The longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable Significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units32Table of ContentsDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill The fair values of our GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values As such even the application of a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in the fair value of either reporting unit being less than its carrying value As an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our reporting units we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date The reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization However any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units Such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting unitsCash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesCash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition  Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets All of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 29 2017 We concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no otherthantemporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of availableforsale investments as of January 29 2017Please refer to Notes 6 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional informationStockbased CompensationOur stockbased compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units or RSUs performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or PSUs performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased PSUs our employee stock purchase plan or ESPP and stock options In fiscal year 2015 we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs PSUs and marketbased PSUs to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies The number of PSUs and marketbased PSUs that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the Companys level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal yearPlease refer to Notes 1 and 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional informationLitigation Investigation and Settlement CostsFrom time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters However there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments If that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with US GAAP However the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs33Table of ContentsResults of

increased revenue from our GeForce GPU gaming and datacenter platforms Sales of highend GeForce GPU products for gaming increased over 40 reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and strong demand for our recent Pascalbased GPU products Datacenter revenue including our Tesla NVIDIA GRID and DGX1 brands increased 145 reflecting strong demand for deep learning training for AI cloud accelerated and virtualized computing and initial DGX1 sales Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 11 due primarily to higher sales in high end desktop and mobile workstation products Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to last year34Table of ContentsGPU business revenue increased by 9 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 This increase was due primarily to increased revenue from sales of highend GeForce GPU products for gaming which increased over 30 reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and increased sales of our Maxwellbased GPU products Revenue from Tesla GPUs for Datacenter increased driven by strong demand from hyperscale companies for deep learning for AI and accelerated computing Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization declined due to weakness in the overall workstation market Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to the prior yearTegra Processor Business  Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 47 in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 This was driven by an increase of over 50 in sales of Tegra products and services serving automotive systems and an increase of almost 50 in gaming development platforms compared to last yearTegra Processor business revenue decreased by 3 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 This decrease was driven by a decline in sales of Tegra products for OEM smartphones and tablets of almost 90 partially offset by an increase in sales of Tegra products serving automotive systems of almost 75 Revenue also grew from development services and sales of SHIELD devicesAll Other License revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with Intel in January 2011 was flat at 264 million for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 The remaining 44 million in revenue under this arrangement will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018Concentration of RevenueRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 80 79 and 75 of total revenue for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different locationRevenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized as follows  Year Ended January 29 2017 January 31 2016 January 25 2015Revenue     Customer A12 11 11 Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions memory and component costs and shipping costs Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing Our overall gross margin was 588 561 and 555 for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively These increases were driven primarily by a higher mix of our GPU business fewer inventory provisions and lower warranty charges in our Tegra Processor businessCharges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 62 million 112 million and 59 million for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 09 22 and 13 respectively Sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 51 million for fiscal year 2017 and 32 million for both fiscal years 2016 and 2015 favorably impacting our gross margin by 07 06 and 07 respectively As a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 02 16 and 06 in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively35Table of ContentsA discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows  GPU Business The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2017 when compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to product mix resulting from increased sales of our GeForce gaming Tesla GRID and Quadro GPU products as well as a continued decrease in sales volumes of lower margin PC OEM products The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2016 when compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to strong sales of our high end GeForce gaming GPU products and the decreased sales volume of lower margin PC OEM products Tegra Processor Business The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal year 2017 when compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to fewer inventory provisions and the absence of the warranty charge associated with the SHIELD tablet product recall during fiscal year 2016 The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business decreased during fiscal year 2016 when compared to fiscal year 2015 due to inventory provisions a warranty charge associated with the SHIELD tablet product recall and higher automotive and SHIELD product sales which have had comparably lower gross margins The inventory provisions related primarily to older generation Tegra products as well as inventory purchase commitments in excess of estimated demand and excess component inventories for SHIELD products Operating Expenses Year Ended Year Ended January 29 2017 January 31

primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs including stockbased compensation expense Offsetting these increases was a 57 million decrease in outside professional fees resulting from the resolution of our intellectual property disputes with Samsung and Qualcomm during early fiscal year 2017Sales general and administrative expenses increased by 25 in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 Outside professional fees increased primarily due to 70 million of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm Compensation and benefits increased by 39 million resulting from employee additions employee compensation increases and related costs including stockbased compensation expense Advertising and promotions increased by 9 million resulting from digital advertising Restructuring and Other ChargesIn fiscal year 2016 we began the wind down our Icera modem operations As a result our operating expenses for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 included 3 million and 131 million respectively of restructuring and other charges Please refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further discussionInterest Income and Interest ExpenseInterest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the Convertible Notes we issued in December 2013 and the Notes we issued in September 2016Interest income was 54 million 39 million and 28 million in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively These increases in interest income were primarily due to higher average cash balances invested in interest bearing securities as well as higher purchased yieldsInterest expense was 58 million 47 million and 46 million in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 The increase in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to interest expense related to the Notes we issued in September 2016 partially offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of the early conversion of a significant portion of the Convertible Notes during fiscal year 2017Other Income Expense NetOther income expense net consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities sales or impairments of investments in nonaffiliated companies losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes and the impact of changes in foreign currency ratesNet other income expense was 25 million 4 million and 14 million in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively The net other expense in fiscal year 2017 compared to the net other income in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to 21 million of losses we recognized from early conversions of the Convertible Notes The decrease for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to less gain recognized from sales of nonaffiliated investments and more losses from foreign currency remeasurement    37Table of ContentsIncome Taxes We recognized income tax expense of 239 million 129 million and 124 million for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Our annual effective tax rate was 125 173 and 165 for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard related to the simplification of certain aspects of stockbased compensation accounting The higher effective tax rate in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2015 was due to an additional amount of earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal year 2016 partially offset by a net income tax benefit related to the Icera modem restructuring in fiscal year 2016Our effective tax rate for each of the fiscal years was lower than the US federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate is lower than the United States federal statutory tax rate of 35 favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the US federal research tax credit favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized

on Form 10K for additional informationOur cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside of the United States As of January 29 2017 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 224 billion held within the United States and 456 billion held outside of the United States Most of the amounts held outside the United States may be repatriated to the United States but under current law would be subject to US federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits Further repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws As of January 29 2017 we have not provided for US federal and state income taxes on approximately 313 billion of undistributed earnings of nonUnited States subsidiaries as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States Although we have no current need to do so if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the United States we would incur US federal and state income tax less applicable foreign tax credits and reduced by the current amount of our US federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards Further in addition to the 224 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the United States and available to fund our US operations and any other US cash needs we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the United States other than by repatriation of foreign earnings where US income tax may otherwise be due  Accordingly we do not reasonably expect any material effect

construction Once construction is complete the lease balance will remain static at the completed cost for the remaining duration of the lease term During construction accrued interest will be capitalized into the lease balance Following construction we will pay rent in the form of interest The lease has an initial 75 year term expiring on December 19 2022 consisting of an approximately 25 year construction period followed by a 5 year lease term We have the option to renew this lease for up to three additional 5 year periods subject to approval by the banks During the term of the lease we may elect to purchase the headquarters building for the amount of the banks investment in the building and any accrued but unpaid rent At the end of the lease term we may elect to buy the building for the outstanding balance on the maturity date or arrange for the cash sale of the building to an unaffiliated third party The aggregate guarantee made by us under the lease is no more than 875 of

MARKET RISKInvestment and Interest Rate Risk As of January 29 2017 and January 31 2016 we had 680 billion and 504 billion respectively in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities As of January 29 2017 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities As of January 29 2017 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments According to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of 33 million Investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall Due in part to these factors our future investment income may be negatively impacted due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates However because any debt securities we hold are classified as availableforsale no gains or losses are realized in our Consolidated Statements of Income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be otherthantemporary Other income expense net could also vary depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and foreign exchange fluctuations Volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them As of January 29 2017 our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented 40 of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for 27 of our total investment portfolio Substantially all of our investments are with AA3 or better rated securities If the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 2 5 the fair values of these investments could decline by approximately 73 million 184 million In December 2013 we issued 150 billion of Convertible Notes In September 2016 we issued 100 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and 100 billion of the Notes Due 2026 In October 2016 we also established a revolving credit facility under which we may borrow repay and reborrow amounts from time to time up to 575 million Please refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets Since the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates However the fair value of the Notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates41Table of ContentsWe are financing the construction of our new headquarters building under an offbalance sheet buildtosuit operating lease financing arrangement Following construction we will pay rent in the form of interest that is based on a variable interest rate and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates In order to mitigate the interest rate risk on the operating lease financing arrangement in fiscal year 2016 we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement which entitles us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates Please refer to Notes 9 and 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information If the syndicate of banks that are participants to the operating lease financing arrangement were to fail to fund loans for any reason we would remain liable for payments due under the swap unless we were to settle the swap If we were to settle the swap at a time when interest rates have fallen relative to the swaps inception the price to settle the swap could be significantForeign Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in Other income expense net in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant The impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015Sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete Conversely decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us Additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than US dollars Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar  During fiscal year 2017 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occurDuring fiscal year 2017 we also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency The change in fair value of these contracts is recorded as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income expense netPlease see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional informationITEM 8 FINANCIAL

Directors of NVIDIA CorporationIn our opinion the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15a1 present fairly in all material respects the financial position of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries at January 29 2017 and January 31 2016 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 29 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America  In addition in our opinion the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15a2 presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements  Also in our opinion the Company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29 2017 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO  The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements on the financial statement schedule and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects  Our audits of the financial statements included examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinionsAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for the income tax effects of sharebased payments in fiscal year 2017A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statementsBecause of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorates PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Jose California    March 1 201747Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

with a focus on PC graphics NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science We have extended our emphasis in recent years to the revolutionary field of artificial intelligence Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers Quadro for designers Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers and GRID for cloudbased visual computing users Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip and incorporates GPUs and multicore CPUs to drive supercomputing for mobile gaming and entertainment devices as well as autonomous robots drones and cars Headquartered in Santa Clara California NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998   All references to NVIDIA we us our or the Company mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries except where it is made clear that the term means only the parent companyFiscal Year We operate on a 52 or 53week year ending on the last Sunday in January Fiscal years 2017 and 2015 were 52week years and fiscal year 2016 was a 53week yearReclassificationsCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentationPrinciples of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our whollyowned subsidiaries All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidationUse of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ from those estimates On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation litigation investigation and settlement costs restructuring and other charges and other contingencies These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonableRevenue Recognition Product RevenueWe recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured For most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer At the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment 54Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedFor sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and in some cases when customer return rights lapse Our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor While we have a long history of rebate arrangements with original equipment manufacturers or OEMs we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual OEMs In such cases the OEMs may not be our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix of demand they place on their contract equipment manufacturers or CEMs and original device manufacturers or ODMs may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings In addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents less than 05 of total revenue Our customer programs also include marketing development funds or MDFs MDFs represent monies paid to retailers system builders OEMs distributors addin card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products Depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns License and Development RevenueFor license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed For most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project A provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenueFor license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue Royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties  We recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee55Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedRestructuring and Other Charges Our restructuring and other charges include employee severance and related costs the writedown of assets and other exit costs The severance and related costs include onetime termination benefits as well as certain statutory termination benefits or employee terminations under ongoing benefit arrangements Onetime termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees unless employees must provide future service in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period Ongoing termination benefits arrangements are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefits becomes estimable and payment is probable Any contract termination costs are recognized at estimated fair value when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms Other associated costs are recognized in the period the liability is incurredAdvertising ExpensesWe expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 were 17 million 30 million and 21 million respectively Rent Expense We recognize rent expense on a straightline basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred but not paid Product Warranties We generally offer limited warranty to endusers that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition Under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimatedStockbased Compensation      We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or RSUs and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or PSUs We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased PSUs The compensation expense for stock options RSUs and marketbased PSUs is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or ESPP using the BlackScholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year Stockbased compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model Additionally we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates If factors change the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current periodLitigation Investigation and Settlement CostsFrom time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters However there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments If that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with US GAAP However the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 56Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedForeign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at endofperiod exchange rates Nonmonetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in Other income expense net in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significantThe impact of gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement included in determining other income expense net was a 5 million loss for fiscal year 2017 and was not significant for fiscal years 2016 and 2015Income Taxes We recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realizedUnited States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonUS subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvestedOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordinglyAs of January 29 2017 we had a valuation allowance of 353 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the periodWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense Please refer to Note 13 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional informationComprehensive Income  Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income loss Other comprehensive income loss components include unrealized gains losses on availableforsale securities and unrealized gains losses on cash flow hedges57Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedNet Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method Under the treasury stock method the effect of stock options outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is antidilutive Additionally we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that requires us upon conversion to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock Our convertible notes note hedges and related warrants contain various conversion features which are further described in Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the convertible notes and warrants under the treasury stock method will be included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion is dilutive However unless actually exercised the note hedges will not be included in the calculation of diluted net income per share as their preexercised effect would be antidilutive under the treasury stock method Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents As of January 29 2017 and January 31 2016 our cash and cash equivalents were 177 billion and 596 million respectively including 321 million and 43 million respectively invested in money market fundsMarketable Securities Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as availableforsale These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of shareholders equity net of tax The fair value of interestbearing securities includes accrued interest Any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income expense net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income expense net section of our Consolidated Statements of IncomeAll of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments If the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument In these situations we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value For availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit

receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 29 2017 and January 31 2016 Marketable securities are comprised of availableforsale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of shareholders equity net of tax Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges the gains losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged For derivative instruments designated as cashflow hedges the effective portion of the gains losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents marketable securities accounts receivable note hedge and interest rate swap Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities the diversification of asset type and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration All marketable securities are held in our name managed by several investment managers and held by one major financial institution under a custodial arrangement Accounts receivable from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total accounts receivable aggregated approximately 29 of our accounts receivable balance from two customers as of January 29 2017 and 28 of our account receivable balance from two customers as of January 31 2016 We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of creditAccounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of creditInventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout and shipping costs as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions Once inventory has been writtenoff or writtendown it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently writtenup Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets generally three to five years Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and a gain or loss is recorded The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to twenty five years Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset59Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedGoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  For the purposes of completing our impairment test we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis For those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred where potential impairment indicators exist or for which we have not performed a quantitative assessment recently we utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment The first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test by weighting the results from the income approach and the market approach The second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities Please refer to Note 4 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Intangible Assets and Other LongLived Assets Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses patents acquired intellectual property trademarks and customer relationships and are subject to an annual impairment test We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern cannot be reliably determined using a straightline amortization method  Longlived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated60Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementIn fiscal year 2017 the Financial Accounting Standards Board or FASB issued an accounting standards update which simplifies certain aspects of stockbased compensation accounting Among other elements the new guidance eliminates additional paid in capital or APIC pools and requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled In addition cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows We elected to early adopt this new guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 which required us to reflect any adjustments as of February 1 2016 Early adoption of this guidance resulted in the followingWe recorded an excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation within income tax expense rather than in APIC of 82 million for fiscal year 2017We recorded a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of February 1 2016 to increase retained earnings by 353 million with a corresponding increase to deferred tax assets to recognize the federal net operating loss and federal research tax credit carryforwards attributable to excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation that had not been previously recognized in APIC We also recorded deferred tax assets of 63 million with a corresponding full valuation allowance related to state net operating loss and state research credit carryforwardsThe excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation is now included in net operating cash rather than net financing cash in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows We elected to apply this change in presentation prospectively and thus prior periods have not been adjustedWe elected not to change our policy on accounting for forfeitures although the new guidance provides an option for us to account for forfeitures as they occur and thus continued to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In January 2017 the FASB issued an accounting standards update that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment The update eliminates the second step in the goodwill impairment test that requires an entity to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill Instead an entity should recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit The update will be effective for us beginning in our fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted The adoption of this accounting guidance is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statementsIn October 2016 the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires the recognition of income tax consequences for intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 with early adoption permitted The adoption of this accounting guidance is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements In August 2016 the FASB issued an accounting standards update that clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 with early adoption permitted The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statementsIn June 2016 the FASB issued an accounting standards update that changes the accounting for recognizing impairments of financial assets Under the new guidance credit losses for certain types of financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses The update also modifies the impairment models for availableforsale debt securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2021 with early adoption permitted The adoption of this accounting guidance is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements61Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedIn February 2016 the FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with a lease term of more than 12 months The update will require additional disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements Under existing guidance operating leases are not recorded as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements However we expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance SheetsThe FASB issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under US GAAP for all companies in all industries effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period We expect to adopt this guidance beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective approach While we are still finalizing our analysis to quantify the adoption impact of the provisions of the new standard we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statementsNote 2 StockBased CompensationOur stockbased compensation expense is associated with stock options restricted stock units or RSUs performance stock units that are based on our corporate

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedNote 9 Derivative Financial InstrumentsIn fiscal year 2016 we entered into an interest rate swap for a portion of the operating lease financing arrangement for our new headquarters building that entitles us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates The objective of this interest rate swap is to mitigate variability in the benchmark interest rate on the first 200 million of existing operating lease financing payments This interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge will have settlements beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 and will terminate in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 Gains or losses on this swap are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and will subsequently be recorded in earnings at the point when the related operating lease financing expense begins to affect earnings or if ineffectiveness of the swap should occurIn fiscal year 2017 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a total US dollar equivalent notional value of 227 million to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur The fair value of the contracts as of January 29 2017 was not significant We also entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a total US dollar equivalent notional value of 99 million to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency These foreign currency forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment Therefore the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income expense net Under the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts we are allowed to net settle transactions with the same counterparty subject to applicable requirements However we present our derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values on our Consolidated Balance Sheets We are not required to pledge and are not entitled to receive cash collateral related to these derivative instruments As of January 29 2017 the maturities of the designated foreign currency forward contracts were three months or less We formally assess both at inception and on an ongoing basis whether derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment are highly effective During fiscal year 2017 all derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment were determined to be highly effective and there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness For fiscal years 2017 and 2016 we recognized a net change in unrealized gains losses on derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment of 4 million and 4 million respectively net of tax in other comprehensive income lossWe expect to realize all gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months However we do not expect to reclassify any amount from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into earnings related to the interest rate swap as the underlying operating lease financing payments for our new headquarters building will not start within the next twelve months75Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedNote 10 Guarantees US GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee In addition US GAAP requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued including a tabular reconciliation of the changes of the entitys product warranty liabilities Accrual for Product Warranty LiabilitiesWe record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties Under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products Additionally we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimatedIn fiscal year 2016 we announced a voluntary recall and replacement of our SHIELD 8inch tablets that were sold between July 2014 and July 2015 We have determined that the battery in these tablets can overheat posing a fire hazard The recall did not affect any other NVIDIA products In fiscal year 2016 we recorded a 26 million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other associated costs The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities are as follows January 29 2017 January 31 2016 January 25 2015 In millionsBalance at beginning of

Statements for such indemnifications   Note 11 DebtConvertible Debt100  Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018In fiscal year 2014 we issued 150 billion of 100 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 The Convertible Notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations of the Company which pay interest in cash semiannually at a rate of 100 per annum The Convertible Notes will mature on December 1 2018 unless repurchased or converted prior to such date Upon conversion we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes and may pay or deliver cash shares of our common stock or a combination thereof at our election of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted As of January 29 2017 the conversion rate after adjusting for dividend increases was 498351 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes equivalent to an adjusted conversion price of 200662 per share of common stockHolders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to August 1 2018 under certain circumstances For example during any fiscal quarter if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day the Notes become convertible at the holders option As this condition was met the Convertible Notes first became convertible at the holders option beginning on the first day of fiscal year 2017 and continued to be convertible at the holders option through April 30 2017 76Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND

exceeded their principal amount by approximately 378 billionSubsequent to January 29 2017 we have settled an additional 502 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes and issued 20 million additional shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value Based on additional conversion requests we have received we expect to settle an additional 103 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes and issue additional shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value during the remainder of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and to settle another additional 55 million in principal amount of Convertible Notes and issue additional shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 The actual number of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based upon the terms of the Convertible Notes and we expect to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock under the terms of the Note HedgesWe separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the Convertible Notes at issuance since our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal could be fully or partially settled in cash The liability component was assigned by estimating the fair value of a similar debt without the conversion feature The difference between the net cash proceeds and the liability component was assigned as the equity component The initial liability component of the Convertible Notes was valued at 135 billion and the initial carrying value of the equity component recorded in additional paidincapital was valued at 126 million This equity component together with the 23 million purchasers discount to the par value of the Convertible Notes represented the initial aggregate unamortized debt discount of 148 million The debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method and an interest rate of 315As of January 29 2017 the carrying value of the Convertible Notes was classified as a current liability and the difference between the principal amount and the carrying value of

effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard related to the simplification of certain aspects of stockbased compensation accounting The higher effective tax rate in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2015 was due to an additional amount of earnings subject to United States tax in fiscal year 2016 partially offset by a net income tax benefit related to the Icera modem restructuring in fiscal year 2016Our effective tax rate for each of the fiscal years was lower than the US federal statutory rate of 35 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate is lower than the United States federal statutory tax rate of 35 favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the US federal research tax credit and favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations and adoption of an accounting standard related to stockbased compensation during fiscal year 2017As of January 29 2017 and January 31 2016 we had a valuation allowance of 353 million and 272 million respectively related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the periodAs of January 29 2017 we had federal state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of 448 million 446 million and 219 million respectively The federal and state carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal year 2022 and 2018 respectively The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of 219 million may be carried forward indefinitely As of January 29 2017 we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of 541 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2018 We have state research tax credit carryforwards of 476 million of which 457 million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely and 19 million is attributable to various other states and will expire beginning in fiscal year 2018 Our tax attributes net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws other authoritative interpretations thereof or other facts and circumstances Utilization of federal state and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions If any such limitations apply the federal states or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as applicable may expire or be denied before utilizationAs of January 29 2017 US federal and state income taxes have not been provided on approximately 313 billion of undistributed earnings of nonUnited States subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in our foreign subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicableAs of January 29 2017 we had 224 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 209 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized However approximately 27 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken that if recognized would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance The 209 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 29 2017 consisted of 83 million recorded in noncurrent income taxes payable and 126 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assetsA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as

receipt of cash for income taxes within one year The amount is classified as a longterm liability or reduction of longterm deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a yearOur policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense As of January 29 2017 January 31 2016 and January 25 2015 we had accrued 13 million 11 million and 14 million respectively for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits As of January 29 2017 noncurrent income taxes payable of 96 million consisted of unrecognized tax benefits of 83 million and the related interest and penalties of 13 millionWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position Accordingly our provisions on federal state and foreign taxrelated matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved As of January 29 2017 we do not believe that our estimates as otherwise provided for on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve monthsWe are subject

our chief operating decision maker or CODM reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments We report our business in two primary reportable segments the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business based on a single underlying graphics architecture Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers Quadro for designers Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers and GRID for cloudbased visual computing users Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip and incorporates GPUs and multicore CPUs to drive supercomputing for mobile gaming and entertainment devices as well as autonomous robots drones and carsWe have a single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors This architecture unification leverages our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments our CODM assigns 100 of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most  The All Other category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stockbased compensation expense corporate infrastructure
