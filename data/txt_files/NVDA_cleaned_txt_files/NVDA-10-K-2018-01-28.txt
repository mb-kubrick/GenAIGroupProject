condition results of operations or reputation Risks Related to Our Business Industry and Partners If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets or identify new products services or technologies our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted We have created GPUbased visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets Gaming Professional Visualization Datacenter and Automotive These markets often experience rapid technological change changes in customer requirements new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards Our success depends on our ability to identify these emerging industry changes and to develop new or enhance our existing products services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets Such activities may require considerable technical financial compliance sales and marketing investments We currently devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history such as the automotive and datacenter markets which presents additional risks to our business We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale our business in these areas including customer service and customer support We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards which are subject to change Additionally we continue to make considerable investments in research and development which may not produce significant revenue for several years if at all If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products services and technologies or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted our business revenue financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers partners and ultimately our shareholders If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities our business will be harmed Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue Our target markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets Our competitors products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or better features than ours which may result among other things in lower than expected selling prices for our products In addition some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities have longer operating histories larger customer bases more comprehensive intellectual property or IP portfolios and patent protections and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their products including semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment including in significant international markets such as China demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer In addition the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation which could lead to fewer customers partners or suppliers any of which could negatively affect our financial results 12 Table of Contents System security and data

result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation If our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share Our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices markets technologies and applications including into the automotive market or as new versions are released Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services Failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs ODMs AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs write off the value of related inventory cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue In addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers perceptions of our brand Also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field A product recall including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation harm our ability to attract new customers result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits If a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business Further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial results We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yields development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility Instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques Similarly we do not directly assemble test or package our products but instead rely on 13 Table of Contents independent subcontractors We do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors As a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our products a failure to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as 16nm FinFET and memory designs such as CoWoS needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis loss of a supplier and additional expense andor production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality and delays in product shipments shortages a decrease in product quality andor higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors orders over our orders or otherwise In addition low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand increase manufacturing costs harm customer or partner relationships andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry As a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem We also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner In the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline If we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers Further if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards including safety standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated if any Business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages outages at cloud service providers tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions cyberattacks terrorist attacks medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in Asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity In addition a majority of our current datacenter capacity is located in California making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas The manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including Taiwan China and Korea Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the US or abroad also may result in changing regulatory requirements 14 Table of Contents trade policies and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies access to global markets hiring and profitability Catastrophic events can also have an impact on thirdparty vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues The ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the thirdparty systems on which we rely our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue increases in expenses substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations If we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize In estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions including downturns in our target markets andor overall economy changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit market a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products less demand than expected for newlyintroduced products or increased competition including competitive pricing actions The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins In addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals We could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial results Conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events In such cases even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner If we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our business We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States and Other Americas We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States and Other Americas Revenue from sales outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 79 80 and 79 of total revenue for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively Additionally as of January 28 2018 approximately 47 of our employees were located outside of the United States The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including international economic and political conditions such as political tensions between countries in which we do business unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in tax laws differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions including deemed export restrictions tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions 15 Table of Contents disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations and increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations such as carbon taxes fuel or energy taxes and pollution limits If our sales outside of the United States and Other Americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted If we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive In particular hiring qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business Additionally changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected Additionally competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stockbased compensation The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs Effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products We have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products strategic objectives and business The risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results Given that our resources are limited our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives Additional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include but are not limited to difficulty in combining the technology products operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business diversion of capital and other resources including managements attention assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses impairment charges to goodwill or writedowns of acquired assets difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return if at all difficulty in obtaining regulatory other approvals or financing failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment if at all the need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company and impairment of relationships with or loss of our or our targets employees vendors and customers as a result of our acquisition or investment Risks Related to Regulatory Legal Our Common Stock and Other Matters Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products We have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others 16 Table of Contents regardless of their merit could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to defend and resolve such claims and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results Further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third partys patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third partys patent or other intellectual property rights However we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted Furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property To accomplish this we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely In addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors Therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance Factors other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include but are not limited to our ability to achieve volume production of our nextgeneration products our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multiyear development cycle for some of our products and services fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners products our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers contractual obligations product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products inventory writedowns our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems and our partner networks ability to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers customer bad debt writeoffs any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property 17 Table of Contents changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards and general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation deter current and potential users from using our products and services result in liability or result in legal or regulatory proceedings Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results The theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs damage to our reputation regulatory proceedings disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection which continue to evolve and apply to our business For example the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR which requires companies to meet new requirements beginning in May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue In addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices If so we may be ordered to change our data practices andor be fined Complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations Further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates As a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities Further changes in United States federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws changes in our business or statutory rates changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in available tax credits the resolution of issues arising from tax audits changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations the impact of accounting for stockbased compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur the impact of accounting for business combinations shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax changes in our international organization as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation investigations and regulatory proceedings We have in the past and may from time to time face legal administrative and regulatory proceedings claims demands and investigations involving shareholder consumer competition and other issues relating to our business on a global basis In the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities and we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation The laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or remedy violations of these regulations Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing 18 Table of Contents of patents An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends In addition regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control Our status as a Delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders In addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock These provisions include the following the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval a supermajority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders and the ability of our Board of Directors to make amend or repeal our bylaws On March 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox Under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable ITEM 2 PROPERTIES Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara California It includes ten leased commercial buildings totaling 963317 square feet and real property that we own totaling 1496006 square feet Our owned property consists of seven commercial buildings on 36 acres of land In addition we also lease datacenter space in Santa Clara California Outside of Santa Clara California we lease facilities in Austin Texas and a number of regional facilities in other US locations that are used as research and development centers andor sales and administrative offices Outside of the United States we own a building in Hyderabad India that is being used primarily as a research and development center We also lease facilities in various international locations that are used as research and development centers andor sales and administrative offices These leased facilities are located primarily in Asia and Europe In addition we also lease datacenter space in various locations around the world We believe that we currently have sufficient facilities to conduct our operations for the

August 2004 our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock In November 2016 the Board authorized an additional 200 billion under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020 Since the inception of our share repurchase program we have repurchased an aggregate of 251 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of 55 billion through January 28 2018 All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock As of January 28 2018 we were authorized subject to certain specifications to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to 182 billion through December 2020 For fiscal year 2019 we intend to return 125 billion to our shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases The repurchases can be made in the open market in privately negotiated transactions or in structured share repurchase programs and can be made in one or more larger repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion As part of our share repurchase program we may enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial

each of our market platforms gaming professional visualization datacenter and automotive GPU business revenue was 814 billion up 40 from a year earlier led by growth in gaming datacenter and professional visualization Strong growth across our Pascalbased GeForce gaming GPUs was driven by growth associated with GPU refreshesupgrades new gamers new games eSports and cryptocurrency mining Revenue for datacenter including Tesla NVIDIA GRID and NVIDIA DGX was 193 billion up 133 year on year led by strong sales of our Volta architecture including V100 GPU accelerators which began shipping in the first half of fiscal year 2018 and are available through major computer makers and cloud providers new DGX systems and design wins in HPC Professional visualization revenue grew 12 year over year to 934 million led by ultrahighend and highend desktop workstations as well as unique form factors and emerging opportunities including AI deep learning VR and rendering 23 Table of Contents Tegra processor business revenue was 153 billion up 86 from a year ago Tegra processor business revenue includes SOC modules for the Nintendo Switch gaming console and development services Also included was automotive revenue of 558 million which was up 15 from a year earlier incorporating infotainment modules production DRIVE PX platforms and development agreements for selfdriving cars Revenue from our patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 Gross margin for fiscal year 2018 was 599 compared with 588 a year earlier reflecting a favorable shift in mix the growth of our GeForce gaming GPUs and the growth of our GPU computing platform for cloud deep learning AI and graphics virtualization partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel Operating expenses for fiscal year 2018 were 261 billion up from 213 billion in the previous year This reflects growth in employees and related costs as well as investments in growth initiatives including gaming AI and autonomous driving We recorded a US tax reform provisional net tax benefit of 133 million associated with the onetime transition tax on our historical foreign earnings and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to the lower corporate tax rate Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2018 were 305 billion and 482 respectively up 83 and 88 respectively from a year earlier fueled by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins We returned 125 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2018 through a combination of 909 million in share repurchases and 341 million in quarterly cash dividends In November 2017 we declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 015 per share from 014 per share For fiscal year 2019 we intend to return 125 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 711 billion as of January 28 2018 compared with 680 billion as of January 29 2017 The increase was primarily related to the increase in operating income GPU Business During fiscal year 2018 we released many new gaming GPU products based on our new NVIDIA Pascal architecture including GeForce GTX 1070 Ti 1080 Ti and TITAN Xp We also announced gaming laptops using the MaxQ design which are 3x faster and 3x thinner than previousgeneration gaming laptops and enhanced GeForce Experience with new tools including NVIDIA Freestyle for customizing gameplay and an updated interface for the NVIDIA Ansel photo mode as well as new titles including PlayerUnknowns Battleground and Fortnite that support NVIDIA ShadowPlay Highlights for capturing gaming achievements For our professional visualization platform we opened early access to NVIDIA Holodeck and launched the Quadro Virtual Data Center Workstation introduced Project Holodeck a photorealistic collaborative VR environment launched external GPU support for creative professionals and released the NVIDIA Optix 50 and NVIDIA VRWorks 360 Video software development kits For our datacenter platform we announced that NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU accelerators are available through virtually every major computer maker and have been chosen by nearly every major cloud provider to deliver AI and HPC We added 34 GPUaccelerated systems to the Top 500 supercomputer list bringing the total number of systems relying on NVIDIA GPUs to 87 announced partnerships to further AI in key vertical industries and launched the NVIDIA GPU Cloud container registry to support scientists using HPC applications and AI researchers using desktop GPUs Tegra Processor Business During fiscal year 2018 for the automotive market we announced the NVIDIA DRIVE AI selfdriving platform which enables automakers and Tier1 suppliers to accelerate production of automated and autonomous vehicles the NVIDIA DRIVE Xavier autonomous machine processor to power the NVIDIA DRIVE software stack and NVIDIA DRIVE PX Pegasus an autograde AI computer designed to enable driverless robotaxis without steering wheels pedals or mirrors We also announced several new partnerships aimed at getting AIpowered cars trucks and commercial vehicles on the road including partnerships with Aurora Autoliv Baidu Bosch Continental MercedesBenz Uber Volkswagen Volvo Toyota and ZF In addition we introduced NVIDIA Jetson TX2 a highperformance lowpower computer platform for delivering AI at the edge with deep learning and computer vision capabilities for robots drones and smart cameras the NVIDIA Isaac robot simulator for training intelligent machines in simulated realworld conditions before deployment and the NVIDIA Metropolis platform used by more than 50 partners to make cities safer and smarter by applying deep learning to surveillance video streams 24 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or US GAAP The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10K Revenue Recognition Product Revenue We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured Our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor as we typically find that over 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents less than 05 of total revenue Our customer programs also include marketing development funds or MDFs MDFs represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and are typically designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns License and Development Revenue For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed For most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project We periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate Revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress Significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total cost Any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information 25 Table of Contents Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and m arket conditions Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition In addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and an unfavorable impact of 16 in fiscal year 2016 The charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal years were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products As a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand In doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints We also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions all of which may impact demand for our products Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion Income Taxes We recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly As of January 28 2018 we had a valuation allowance of 469 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense The TCJA which was enacted in December 2017 significantly changes US tax law including a reduction of the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreignsource earnings As a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019 Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information specific to accounting for income taxes and the impacts from the enactment of the TCJA 26 Table of Contents Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value We have identified two reporting units GPU and Tegra Processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis Goodwill assigned to the GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units as of January 28 2018 was 210 million and 408 million respectively Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain We use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit In applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill The fair values of our GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values As such even the application of a hypotheti cal 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in the fair value of either reporting unit being less than its carrying value Refe r to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value The fair values of our financial assets are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets All of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments We performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of January 28 2018 We concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no otherthantemporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of availableforsale investments as of January 28 2018 Refe r to Notes 6 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Stockbased Compensation Our stockbased compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units or RSUs performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or PSUs performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased PSUs and our employee stock purchase plan or ESPP The number of PSUs and marketbased PSUs that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the Companys level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year Re fer to Notes 1 and 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Litigation Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters However there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments If that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations co uld be materially and adversely affected If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such 27 Table of Contents events we will record the loss in accordance with US GAAP However the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs Results of Operations The following table sets forth for the periods

business revenue increased by 40 in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 led by growth in gaming datacenter and professional visualization Revenue from sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming increased over 20 reflecting continued strong demand for our Pascalbased GPU products Datacenter revenue including Tesla GRID and DGX increased 133 reflecting strong demand from hyperscale and cloud customers for deep learning training and accelerated GPU computing as well as demand for HPC DGX AI supercomputing and GRID virtualization platforms Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 12 due primarily to higher sales in both high end desktop and mobile workstation products Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs increased by over 90 due primarily to strong demand for GPU products targeted for cryptocurrency mining GPU business revenue increased by 39 in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 This increase was primarily due to increased revenue from our GeForce GPU gaming and datacenter platforms Sales of highend GeForce GPU products for gaming increased over 40 reflecting a combination of continued strength in PC gaming and strong demand for our recent Pascalbased GPU products Datacenter revenue including our Tesla NVIDIA GRID and DGX1 brands increased by 145 reflecting strong demand for deep learning training for AI cloud accelerated and virtualized 28 Table of Contents computing and initial DGX1 sales Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 11 due primarily to higher sales in high end desktop and mobile workstation products Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs declined compared to fiscal year 2016 Tegra Processor Business Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 86 in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 This was driven by an increase of over 300 in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms and development services and an increase of 15 in automotive revenue primarily from infotainment modules DRIVE PX platforms and development agreements for selfdriving cars Tegra Processor business revenue increased by 47 in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 This was driven by an increase of over 50 in sales of Tegra products and services serving automotive systems and an increase of almost 50 in gaming development platforms and services compared to fiscal year 2016 All Other Our patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 For fiscal year 2018 we recognized related revenue of 43 million down from 264 million for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States and Other Americas accounted for 79 80 and 79 of total revenue for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based o n the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location No single customer represented more than 10 of total revenue for fiscal year 2018 In fiscal years 2017 and 2016 we had one customer that represented 12 and 11 of our total revenue respectively Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions memory and component costs and shipping costs Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing Our overall gross margin was 599 588 and 561 for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively These increases were driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix the growth of our GeForce gaming GPU revenue and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud deep learning AI and graphics virtualization The increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 Charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 48 million 62 million and 112 million for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively Sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 35 million 51 million and 32 million for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively As a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and an unfavorable impact of 16 for fiscal year 2016 A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows GPU Business The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to strong sales of our GeForce gaming GPU products and revenue growth in datacenter including Tesla GRID and DGX for cloud deep learning AI and graphics virtualization The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2017 when compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to product mix resulting from increased sales of our gaming datacenter and professional visualization GPU products as well as a continued decrease in sales volumes of lower margin PC OEM products Tegra Processor Business The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to revenue growth in gaming development platforms and automotive The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business increased during fiscal year 2017 when compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to fewer inventory provisions and the absence of the warranty charge associated with the SHIELD tablet product recall during fiscal year 2016 29 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Year Ended Year Ended

fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs including stockbased compensation expense Sales General and Administrative Sales general and administrative expenses increased by 23 in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 and increased by 10 in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 driven primarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs including stockbased compensation expense Offsetting these increases was a decrease in outside professional fees of 11 million in fiscal year 2018 and 57 million in fiscal year 2017 resulting from the resolution of our intellectual property disputes with Samsung and Qualcomm Restructuring and Other Charges In fiscal year 2016 we began to wind down our Icera modem operations As a result our operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included 131 million of restructuring and other charges Total Other Income Expense Interest Income and Interest Expense Interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Interest income was 69 million 54 million and 39 million in fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and higher yields on our investments from a rising interest rate environment Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 220 Notes Due 2021 and 320 Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016 and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013 Interest expense was 61 million 58 million and 47 million in fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 Other Net Other net consists primarily of realized gains and losses from the sale of marketable securities sales or impairments of investments in nonaffiliated companies losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates Net other expense was 22 million and 25 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively and was insignificant in fiscal year 2016 The net other expense in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to losses on early conversions of the Convertible Notes 30 Table of Contents Income Taxes The TCJA which was enacted in December 2017 significantly changes US tax law including a reduction of the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreignsource earnings As a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019 The corporate tax reduction is effective as of January 1 2018 Since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar year we are subject to transitional tax rules As a result our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of 339 The change in the statutory tax rate from 35 to 339 for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate We recognized income tax expense of 149 million 239 million and 129 million for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively Our annual effective tax rate was 47 125 and 173 for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard in fiscal year 2017 related to the simplification of certain aspects of stockbased compensation accounting Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was lower than the blended US federal statutory rate of 339 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate was lower than the US federal statutory tax rates favorable recognition of the US federal research tax credit the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes in 2018 and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was lower than US federal statutory tax rate of 35 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate was lower than the US federal statutory tax rates favorable recognition in those fiscal years of the US federal research tax credit favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations and adoption of an accounting standard related to stockbased compensation in fiscal year 2017 For fiscal year 2018 we recognized provisional amounts for the tax effects of the TCJA which were included as components of income tax expense and reflected in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 We will continue to assess the impact of the recently enacted tax law on our business and our consolidated financial statements The final impact of the TCJA recorded by us may vary materially from the provisional impact recorded due to a number of uncertainties and factors including the need for further guidance and clarification of the new law by US federal and state tax authorities and the need for further guidance on the income tax accounting In addition to the impact on fiscal year 2018 the TCJA also establishes new tax laws that will be effective for our fiscal year 2019 While each of these new tax laws is expected to have some impact on our tax expense for fiscal year 2019 and future periods we expect the provision designed to tax the lowtaxed income of foreign subsidiaries to have the most significant impact Because of the complexity of the new tax laws on the lowtaxed income of certain foreign subsidiaries we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the TCJA and the application of related accounting standards Based on recent deliberations of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or FASB we expect to be allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future taxable income in the US as a currentperiod expense when incurred or 2 factoring such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes Our selection of an accounting policy will depend in part on our analysis of relevant facts to determine what the expected impact would be under each method Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual

portfolio duration Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 and in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher net income and changes in working capital Cash provided by investing activities increased in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to a reduction in purchases of marketable

to higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and lower proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities Cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year

The Credit Agreement also permits us to obtain additional revolving loan commitments andor commitments to issue letters of credit of up to 425 million subject to certain conditions As of January 28

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixedrate investment portfolio and outstanding debt The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses As of January 28 2018 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments According to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of 14 million In fiscal year 2017 we issued 100 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and 100 billion of the Notes Due 2026 In fiscal year 2014 we issued 150 billion of Convertible Notes which had 15 million in principal amount outstanding as of January 28 2018 We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates However the fair value of the Convertible Notes changes primarily when the market price of our stock fluctuates Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 Sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other 34 Table of Contents currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete Conversely decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us Additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than US dollars Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than US dollar These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment Therefore the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income or expense Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated

Significant Accounting Policies Our Company Starting with a focus on PC graphics NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of artificial intelligence Headquartered in Santa Clara California NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998 All references to NVIDIA we us our or the Company mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries except where it is made clear that the term means only the parent company Fiscal Year We operate on a 52 or 53week year ending on the last Sunday in January Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 are both 52week years and fiscal year 2016 was a 53week year Reclassifications Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our whollyowned subsidiaries All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ materially from our estimates On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation litigation investigation and settlement costs restructuring and other charges and other contingencies These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable Revenue Recognition Product Revenue We recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured For most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement We consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer At the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment Our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets We account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor as we typically find that over 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer We recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate Rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate Unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents less than 05 of total revenue Our customer programs also include marketing development funds or MDFs MDFs represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and are typically designed to support our partners 47 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued activities while also promoting NVIDIA products We account for MDFs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of MDF program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed We also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns License and Development Revenue For license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed For most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project A provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated Costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts If the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue For license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue Royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties We recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee Advertising Expenses We expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 were 25 million 17 million and 30 million respectively Rent Expense We recognize rent expense on a straightline basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred but not paid Product Warranties We generally offer a limited warranty to endusers that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition Under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated Stockbased Compensation We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or RSUs and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or PSUs We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased PSUs The compensation expense for RSUs and marketbased PSUs is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or ESPP using the BlackScholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year Stockbased compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model Additionally we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates If factors change the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 48 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Restructuring and Other Charges Our restructuring and other charges include employee severance and related costs the writedown of assets and other exit costs The severance and related costs include onetime termination benefits as well as certain statutory termination benefits or employee terminations under ongoing benefit arrangements Onetime termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees unless employees must provide future service in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period Ongoing termination benefits arrangements are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefits becomes estimable and payment is probable Any contract termination costs are recognized at estimated fair value when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms Other associated costs are recognized in the period the liability is incurred Our operating expenses for fiscal year 2016 included 131 million of restructuring and other charges related to the winddown of our Icera operations which was comprised mainly of employee severance facilities and related costs Restructuring charges were not significant for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 Litigation Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters However there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments If that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with US GAAP However the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at endofperiod exchange rates Nonmonetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant Income Taxes We recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly As of January 28 2018 we had a valuation allowance of 469 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period 49 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense In December 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA was enacted into law The TCJA significantly changes US tax law including a reduction of the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreignsource earnings As a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019 Refer to Note 13 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income or loss Other comprehensive income or loss components include unrealized gains or losses on availableforsale securities and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method Under the treasury stock method the effect of stock options outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is antidilutive Additionally we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that requires us upon conversion to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock Our convertible notes note hedges and related warrants contain various conversion features which are further described in Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the convertible notes and warrants under the treasury stock method will be included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion is dilutive However unless actually exercised the note hedges were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share as their preexercised effect would be antidilutive under the treasury stock method Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents As of January 28 2018 and January 29 2017 our cash and cash equivalents were 400 billion and 177 billion respectively including 379 billion and 321 million respectively invested in money market funds Marketable Securities Marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as availableforsale These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss a component of shareholders equity net of tax The fair value of interestbearing securities includes accrued interest Any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income or expense net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income or expense net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income All of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments If the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument In these situations we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value For availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod 50 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 28 2018 and January 29 2017 Marketable securities are comprised of availableforsale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss a component of shareholders equity net of tax Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged For derivative instruments designated as cashflow hedges the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents marketable securities accounts receivable note hedge and interest rate swap Our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities the diversification of asset type and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration All marketable securities are held in our name managed by several investment managers and held by one major financial institution under a custodial arrangement Accounts receivable from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total accounts receivable aggregated approximately 28 of our accounts receivable balance from two customers as of January 28 2018 and 29 of our account receivable balance from two customers as of January 29 2017 We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout and shipping costs as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions Once inventory has been writtenoff or writtendown it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently writtenup Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets generally three to five years Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and a gain or loss is recorded The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 51 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist For the purposes of completing our impairment test we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis For those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred where potential impairment indicators exist or for which we have not performed a quantitative assessment recently we perform a quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment It tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test by weighting the results from the income approach and the market approach Refer to Note 4 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Intangible Assets and Other LongLived Assets Intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses patents acquired intellectual property trademarks and customer relationships and are subject to an annual impairment test We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern cannot be reliably determined using a straightline amortization method Longlived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In October 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board or FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires the recognition of income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs We elected to early adopt this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 which required us to reflect any adjustments as of January 30 2017 Upon adoption of this guidance we recorded a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the first day of fiscal year 2018 to decrease retained earnings by 28 million with a corresponding decrease to prepaid taxes that had not been previously recognized in income tax expense In January 2017 the FASB issued an accounting standards update that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment The update eliminates the second step in the goodwill impairment test that requires an entity to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill Instead an entity should recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and applied it prospectively as permitted by the standard The adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In January 2016 the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments Most prominent among the amendments is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments to be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 We anticipate the adoption of this accounting standard to increase the volatility of our other income or expense net due to the remeasurement of certain of our equity securities primarily our investments in nonaffiliates for fair value changes 52 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued In February 2016 the FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with a lease term of more than 12 months The update will require additional disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements Under existing guidance operating leases are not recorded as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements However we expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets The FASB issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under US GAAP for all companies in all industries We expect to adopt this guidance beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective approach We have made progress in and continue to assess changes in policies processes systems and controls necessary to meet the additional requirements of the guidance While we are still finalizing our analysis to quantify the adoption impact of the provisions of the new revenue standard we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements However we do expect to provide additional disclosure under this guidance including more information regarding estimates and judgments practical expedients used contract balances and performance obligations Note 2 StockBased Compensation Our stockbased compensation expense is associated with stock options restricted stock units or RSUs performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or PSUs performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased PSUs and our employee stock purchase plan or ESPP Our Consolidated Statements of Income include stockbased compensation expense net of amounts capitalized as inventory as follows Year Ended January 28

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Beginning fiscal year 2015 we shifted away from granting stock options and toward granting RSUs PSUs and marketbased PSUs to reflect changing market trends for equity incentives at our peer companies As of January 28 2018 there were 5 million stock options outstanding and the amount of unvested stock options was not significant The number of PSUs that will ultimately vest is contingent on the Companys level of achievement versus the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal year Of the total fair value of equity awards we estimated that the stockbased compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expected to vest for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 was 156 million 98 million and 46 million respectively January 28 2018 January 29 2017 In millions Aggregate unearned stockbased compensation

The riskfree interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility For awards granted we use the dividend yield at grant date Our RSU PSU and marketbased PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair values of RSUs PSUs and marketbased PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield Additionally for employee stock option RSU PSU and marketbased PSU awards we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience Equity Incentive Program We grant or have granted stock options RSUs PSUs marketbased PSUs and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan In 2007 our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan as most recently amended and restated the 2007 Plan The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options nonstatutory stock options restricted stock restricted stock units stock appreciation rights performance stock awards performance cash awards and other stockbased awards to employees directors and consultants Only our employees may receive incentive stock options Up to 207 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan Currently we grant RSUs 54 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued PSUs and marketbased PSUs under the 2007 Plan under which as of January 28 2018 there were 16 million shares available for future issuance Stock options previously granted to employees subject to certain exceptions vest over a four year period subject to continued service with 25 vesting on the anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of the date of grant in the case of grants to existing employees and 625 vesting quarterly thereafter These stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant Subject to certain exceptions RSUs and PSUs granted to employees vest over a four year period subject to continued service with 25 vesting on a predetermined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and i for grants made prior to May 18 2016 125 vesting semiannually thereafter and ii for grants made on or after May 18 2016 625 vesting quarterly thereafter Marketbased PSUs vest 100 on approximately the three year anniversary of the date of grant However the number of shares subject to both PSUs and marketbased PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of predetermined criteria Unless terminated sooner the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21 2022 Our Board may suspend or terminate the 2007 Plan at any time No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it is terminated The Board may also amend the 2007 Plan at any time However if legal regulatory or listing requirements require shareholder approval the amendment will not go into effect until the shareholders have approved the amendment Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2012 our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan as most recently amended and restated the 2012 Plan as the successor to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Up to 75 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan As of January 28 2018 we had issued 28 million shares and reserved 47 million shares for future issuance under the 2012 Plan The 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code Under the current offerings adopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan each offering period is approximately 24 months which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months Employees are eligible to participate if they are employed by us or an affiliate of us as designated by the Board Employees who participate in an offering may have up to 10 of their earnings withheld up to certain limitations and applied on specified dates determined by the Board to the purchase of shares of common stock The Board may increase this percentage at its discretion up to 15 The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85 of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering Employees may end their participation in the 2012 Plan at any time during the offering period and participation ends automatically on termination of employment

year 2018 and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values The fair value was determined by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach These income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business When performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model Our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions The market method of determining the fair value of our reporting units requires us to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market comparables 57 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Note 5

2017 and 2016 respectively Our annual effective tax rate was 47 125 and 173 for fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively In December 2017 the TCJA was enacted into law The TCJA significantly changes US tax law including a reduction of the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on 69 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreignsource earnings As a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 while other provisions will impact us beginning in fiscal year 2019 The corporate tax reduction is effective as of January 1 2018 Since we operate on a fiscal year rather than a calendar year we are subject to transitional tax rules As a result our fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate is a blended rate of 339 The change in the statutory tax rate from 35 to 339 for fiscal year 2018 did not have a significant impact on the effective tax rate US GAAP requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment However the SEC also issued guidance that allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to exceed one year Accordingly as of January 28 2018 we recognized a provisional tax benefit of 133 million as a component of income tax expense which is our reasonable estimate of the effects of the tax law changes on existing deferred tax balances and the calculation of the onetime transition tax The onetime transition tax is based on the post1986 earnings and profits or EP of our foreign subsidiaries We had previously accrued deferred taxes on a portion of these same earnings We recorded a provisional onetime transition tax liability of 971 million and released the previously accrued deferred tax liabilities of 115 billion resulting in a net decrease to income tax expense of 176 million We have reasonably estimated but not yet completed the calculation of the total post1986 EP for our foreign subsidiaries Our calculation of the transition tax may change with further analysis additional guidance from the US federal and state tax authorities and additional guidance for the associated income tax accounting As a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21 companies were required to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment As a result we recorded a provisional income tax expense of 43 million on the writedown of our deferred tax balance The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the tax law changes and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard in fiscal year 2017 related to the simplification of certain aspects of stockbased compensation accounting Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was lower than the blended US federal statutory rate of 339 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate was lower than the US federal statutory tax rates favorable recognition of the US federal research tax credit the provisional impact of the recent tax law changes in 2018 and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 was lower than US federal statutory tax rate of 35 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate was lower than the US federal statutory tax rates favorable recognition in those fiscal years of the US federal research tax credit favorable discrete events primarily attributable to the tax benefit recognized upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations and adoption of an accounting standard related to stockbased compensation in fiscal year 2017 As of January 28 2018 and January 29 2017 we had a valuation allowance of 469 million and 353 million respectively related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period As of January 28 2018 we had federal state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of 74 million 226 million and 281 million respectively The federal and state carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal year 2023 and 2019 respectively The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of 281 million may be carried forward indefinitely As of January 28 2018 we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of 361 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2032 We have state research tax credit carryforwards of 575 million of which 554 million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely and 21 million is attributable to various other states and will expire beginning in fiscal year 2019 Our tax attributes net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws other authoritative interpretations thereof or other facts and circumstances 70 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Utilization of federal state and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions If any such limitations apply the federal states or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as applicable may expire or be denied before utilization As of January 28 2018 we had 447 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 413 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized However approximately 58 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken that if recognized would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance The 413 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 28 2018 consisted of 175 million recorded in noncurrent income taxes payable and 238 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows January 28 2018 January 29 2017 January 31 2016 In millions Balance at beginning of period 224 230 254 Increases in tax positions for prior years 7 3 Decreases in tax positions for prior years 1 1 Increases in tax positions for current year 222 46 28 Settlements 48 Lapse in statute of limitations 5 7 51 Balance at end of period 447 224 230 The increase in the unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the onetime transition tax imposed on foreign earnings under the TCJA We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability or amount refundable to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year The amount is classified as a longterm liability or reduction of longterm deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense As of January 28 2018 January 29 2017 and January 31 2016 we had accrued 15 million 13 million and 11 million respectively for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits As of January 28 2018 unrecognized tax benefits of 175 million and the related interest and penalties of 15 million are included in noncurrent income taxes payable While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position Accordingly our provisions on federal state and foreign taxrelated matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved As of January 28 2018 we do not believe that our estimates as otherwise provided for on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months We are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the United States and throughout the world As of January 28 2018 the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States Hong Kong Taiwan China United Kingdom Germany and India for fiscal years 2003 through 2017 As of January 28 2018 the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include India Taiwan UK and Germany for fiscal years 2003 through 2017 Note 14 Shareholders Equity Capital Return Program Beginning August

Segment Information Our Chief Executive Officer who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker or CODM reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments We report our business in two primary reportable segments the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business based on a single underlying graphics architecture While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers Quadro for designers Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers and GRID for cloudbased visual computing users Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip and incorporates GPUs and multicore CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots drones and cars as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices Under the single unifying graphics architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments our CODM assigns 100 of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most The All Other category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stockbased compensation expense corporate infrastructure and support costs acquisitionrelated costs legal settlement costs contributions restructuring and other charges product warranty charge and other nonrecurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a
