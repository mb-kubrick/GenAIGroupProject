result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer supportWe utilize industryleading suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers We then utilize independent subcontractors such as Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc Amkor Technology BYD Auto Co Ltd Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd JSI Logistics Ltd King Yuan Electronics Co Ltd and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products and platforms We purchase substrates from IbidenCo Ltd Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation and Unimicron Technology Corporation and memory from Micron Technology Samsung Semiconductor Inc and SK HynixWe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and configuration and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or CEMs distributors motherboard and AIB customers from our thirdparty warehouse in Hong Kong Generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or OEMs as motherboard and AIB solutionsWe also utilize industryleading contract manufacturers or CMs such as BYD and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co and ODMs such as Quanta Computer and Wistron Corporation to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers In those cases key elements such as the GPU SOC and memory are often consigned by us to the CMs who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production processWorking CapitalWe focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items We manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platformbyplatform basis We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules A substantial amount of our inventories is maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands9Table of ContentsOur existing cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased by 4 to 742 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019 compared with the end of fiscal year 2018Competition The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and partners and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard APIs manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products In addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market shareA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs embedded SOCs and accelerated and AI computing processor products Some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changesOur current competitors includesuppliers or licensors of discrete and integrated GPUs and accelerated computing solutions including chipsets

RISK FACTORSIn evaluating NVIDIA and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10K Before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below Any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation which could cause our stock price to decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment Additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputationRisks Related to Our Business Industry and PartnersIf we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets or identify new products services or technologies our revenue and financial results may be adversely impactedWe have created GPUbased visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets Gaming Professional Visualization Datacenter and Automotive These markets often experience rapid technological change changes in customer requirements new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards Our success depends on our ability to identify these emerging industry changes and to develop new or enhance our existing products services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets Such activities may require considerable technical financial compliance sales and marketing investments We currently devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history such as the automotive and datacenter markets which presents additional risks to our business We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale our business in these areas including customer service and customer support We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards which are subject to change Additionally we continue to make considerable investments in research and development which may not produce significant revenue for several years if at all If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products services and technologies or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted our business revenue financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers partners and ultimately our shareholders If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities our business will be harmedCompetition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenueOur target markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets Our competitors products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or better features than ours which may result among other things in lower than expected selling prices for our products In addition some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities have longer operating histories larger customer bases more comprehensive intellectual property or IP portfolios and patent protections and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their products including semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment including in significant international markets such as China demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer  In addition the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation which could lead to fewer customers partners or suppliers any of which could negatively affect our financial resultsSystem security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputationSecurity breaches computer malware and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years These threats are constantly evolving making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future Experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties These attacks may 12Table of Contentscreate system disruptions or cause shutdowns These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time For portions of our IT infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems Data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systems To defend against security threats both to our internal systems and those of our customers we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features which may result in increased expensesActual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability paying damages regulatory inquiries or actions damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful We may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions Delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputationIf our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market shareOur products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices markets technologies and applications including into the automotive market or as new versions are released Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services Failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs ODMs AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs write off the value of related inventory cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue In addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers perceptions of our brand Also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field A product recall including automotive recalls or a recall due to a bug in our products or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation harm our ability to attract new customers result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits If a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business Further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial resultsWe depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yields development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our businessWe do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility Instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques Similarly we do not directly assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors We do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors As a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results includinga lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraintsa failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our products13Table of Contentsa failure to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basisloss of a supplier and additional expense andor production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a suppliera lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality anddelays in product shipments shortages a decrease in product quality andor higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors orders over our orders or otherwiseIn addition low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand increase manufacturing costs harm customer or partner relationships andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry As a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem We also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner In the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline If we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmedFor our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers Further if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards including safety standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated if anyBusiness disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costsOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages outages at cloud service providers tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions cyberattacks terrorist attacks medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California and other critical business operations finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in Asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity In addition a large portion of our current datacenter capacity is located in California making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas The manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including Taiwan China and Korea Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad also may result in changing regulatory requirements trade policies import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies product demand access to global markets hiring and profitability In particular revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import duties or tariffs restrictions and controls on imports or exports or other retaliatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our business plans  For example  regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of  2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans  Catastrophic events can also have an impact on thirdparty vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel Our operations 14Table of Contentscould be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues The ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the thirdparty systems on which we rely our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue increases in expenses substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operationsIf we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmedWe manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements We sell many of our products through a channel model and our channel customers sell to retailers distributors andor end customers  As a result the decisions made by our channel partners retailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results  In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pentup demand  Such decisions may and have resulted in prolonged channel sellthrough as we experienced with our midrange gaming GPUs in fiscal year 2019 In estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory includechanges in business and economic conditions including downturns in our target markets andor overall economychanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit marketa sudden and significant decrease in demand for our productsa higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirementsour introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products less demand than expected for newlyintroduced products orincreased competition including competitive pricing actionsThe cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins In addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals We could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial resultsConversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events In such cases even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner If we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damagedWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our businessWe conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States We allocate revenue to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location Revenue from sales outside of the United States accounted for 87 of total revenue for each of fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 Revenue from billings to China including Hong Kong was 24 of our revenue for fiscal year 2019 even if our customers revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location Additionally as of January 27 2019 approximately 46 of our employees were located outside of the United States The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations includinginternational economic and political conditions including as a result of the United Kingdoms vote to withdraw from the European Union and other political tensions between countries in which we do businessunexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in tax lawsdiffering legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices15Table of Contentslocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulationsexporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions  including deemed export restrictions tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations andincreased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations such as carbon taxes fuel or energy taxes and pollution limitsIf our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impactedIf we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive In particular hiring qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business Additionally changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected Additionally competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stockbased compensation The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs Effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and executionWe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our productsWe have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products strategic objectives and business The risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results Given that our resources are limited our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives Additional risks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include but are not limited todifficulty in combining the technology products operations or workforce of the acquired business with our businessdiversion of capital and other resources including managements attention assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses impairment charges to goodwill or writedowns of acquired assets difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return if at all difficulty in obtaining regulatory other approvals or financing failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment if at all the need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company andimpairment of relationships with or loss of our or our targets employees vendors and customers as a result of our acquisition or investment16Table of ContentsRisks Related to Regulatory Legal Our Common Stock and Other MattersActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our productsWe have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others regardless of their merit could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to defend and resolve such claims and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnelWe may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results Further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third partys patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third partys patent or other intellectual property rights However we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted Furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating resultsOur success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property To accomplish this we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely In addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protectionsOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could declineOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors Therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performanceFactors other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include but are not limited toour ability to achieve volume production of our nextgeneration productsour inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multiyear development cycle for some of our products and servicesfluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners products our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricingour ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers contractual obligationsproduct rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issuesour ability to

liabilitiesunexpected costs related to our ownership of real propertychanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards andgeneral macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target marketsAny one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatilityPrivacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation deter current and potential users from using our products and services result in liability or result in legal or regulatory proceedingsOur products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results The theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs damage to our reputation regulatory proceedings disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claimsWorldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection which continue to evolve and apply to our business For example the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR which requires companies to meet new requirements beginning in May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue In addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices If so we may be ordered to change our data practices andor be fined Complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations Further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activityWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax ratesAs a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities Further changes in United States federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJAOur future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws changes in our business or statutory rates changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in available tax credits the resolution of issues arising from tax audits changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations the impact of accounting for stockbased compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur the impact of accounting for business combinations shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax changes in our international organization as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income18Table of ContentsOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation investigations and regulatory proceedingsWe currently and may in the future face legal administrative and regulatory proceedings claims demands andor investigations involving shareholder consumer competition andor other issues relating to our business on a global basis For example multiple securities litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand In addition a stockholder purporting to act on behalf of the Company filed a derivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the Company against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends In addition regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations In addition the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or remedy violations of these regulationsDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in controlOur status as a Delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders In addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock These provisions include the followingthe ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approvalthe prohibition of shareholder action by written consentadvance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposalsthe ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approvala supermajority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylawsthe inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders andthe ability of our Board of Directors to make amend or repeal our bylawsOn March 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox Under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal

graphics NVIDIA invented the GPU to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of VR HPC and AI  Our two reportable segments GPU and Tegra Processor are based on a single underlying architecture From our proprietary processors we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical Gaming Professional Visualization Datacenter and AutomotiveOur GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers Quadro for designers Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers and GRID for cloudbased visual computing users Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip and incorporates GPUs and multicore CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots drones and cars as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices Headquartered in Santa Clara California NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993

billion up 25 from a year earlier Tegra Processor business revenue which includes automotive SOC modules for gaming platforms and embedded edge AI platforms was 154 billion up slightly from a year agoGaming revenue was 625 billion up 13 from a year ago driven by growth in gaming GPUs Gaming GPU growth was fueled by Turingbased GPUs for desktops and by gaming notebooks based on our MaxQ technology We experienced significant volatility in our Gaming revenue during fiscal year 2019 We believe demand for our desktop gaming GPU products used by end users for cryptocurrency mining and its aftereffects have distorted trends in Gaming revenue We also believe that deteriorating macroeconomic conditions particularly in China have impacted consumer demand for our GeForce gaming GPU products In addition sales of certain highend GeForce gaming GPUs using our new Turing architecture that we released during fiscal year 2019 were lower than we expected for the launch of a new architecture As a result during a portion of fiscal year 2019 we shipped a higher amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to where end user demand turned out to be and subsequently compensated by shipping a lower amount of desktop gaming GPU products relative to end user demand to allow the channel to work down that inventory For fiscal year 2020 we expect our Gaming revenue to be slightly down compared to fiscal year 2019 with expected growth from sales of Turingbased GPU products and notebook GPU products partially offsetting decreases that we believe were caused by the previouslynoted factorsProfessional visualization revenue was 113 billion up 21 from a year earlier driven by strength across both desktop and mobile workstation products Datacenter revenue was 293 billion up 52 from a year ago led by strong sales of our Volta architecturebased products including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems Toward the end of fiscal year 2019 we believe that customers across broadbased vertical markets and geographies became increasingly cautious due to economic uncertainty and a number of 24Table of ContentsDatacenter deals did not close While we believe the pause is temporary our visibility remains relatively low and we do not expect a meaningful recovery in the Datacenter market until later in fiscal year 2020 Automotive revenue of 641 million was up 15 from a year earlier driven by infotainment modules production DRIVE platforms and development agreements with automotive companiesOEM and IP revenue was 767 million down 1 from a year ago driven by the absence of Intel licensing revenue which concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 Revenue from cryptocurrencyspecific products in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 306 million and 273 million respectively We expect revenue from cryptocurrencyspecific products to be negligible going forwardGross margin for fiscal year 2019 was 612 compared with 599 a year earlier which reflects our continued shift toward highervalue platforms which more than offset the impact of approximately 128 million in charges for excess DRAM and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of 57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chipsOperating expenses for fiscal year 2019 were 337 billion up 29 from a year earlier reflecting primarily employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs including infrastructure costs Income from operations for fiscal year 2019 was 380 billion up 19 from a year earlier Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2019 were 414 billion and 663 respectively up 36 and 38 respectively from a year earlier fueled primarily by revenue growth and improved gross margin as well as the impact of the US tax reform benefitDuring fiscal year 2019 we returned 195 billion to shareholders through a combination of 158 billion in share repurchases and 371 million in quarterly cash dividends We intend to return 300 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020 including 700 million of share repurchases we made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 742 billion as of January 27 2019 compared with 711 billion as of January 28 2018 The increase was primarily related to the increase in net income partially offset by changes in working capital and the increases in stock repurchases dividends and taxes paid related to restricted stock unitsGPU BusinessDuring fiscal year 2019 for gaming we announced NVIDIA RTX a computer graphics technology using our Turing architecture that produces moviequality images in real time using ray tracing and AI During the year we released many new GeForce RTX desktop gaming GPU products including RTX 2080Ti 2080 2070 and 2060 as well as many new MaxQ GeForce gaming notebook GPU products the most recent of which are powered by RTX GPUsFor our professional visualization platform we announced the Quadro GV100 GPU with RTX technology making realtime ray tracing possible on professional design and content creation applications We also unveiled the Quadro RTX series which is designed to revolutionize the workflow of designers and artists on the desktop and announced the NVIDIA CUDAaccelerated REDCODE RAW decode SDK enabling developers and studios to edit 8K videoFor our datacenter platform we unveiled many advances to our deep learning computing platform including NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs with 32GB memory NVIDIA NVSwitch GPU interconnect fabric the NVIDIA DGX2 and HGX2 for AI and HPC the NVIDIA RTX Server and TensorRT 4 AI inference accelerator software In addition we introduced RAPIDS an opensource GPUacceleration platform for data science and machine learning launched the NVIDIA T4 cloud GPU and NVIDIA TensorRT Hyperscale Inference Platform for advanced acceleration in hyperscale datacenters announced GPU acceleration for Kubernetes to facilitate enterprise inference deployment on multicloud GPU clusters and announced that five of the worlds seven fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA GPUsTegra Processor BusinessDuring fiscal year 2019 for the automotive market we introduced the NVIDIA DRIVE AutoPilot Level 2 automated driving system announced NVIDIA DRIVE AGX design wins with Toyota Volvo Cars and Isuzu Motors and announced that Daimler and Bosch have selected NVIDIAs DRIVE platform to bring automated and driverless vehicles to city streets We also began production of our Xavier singlechip autopilot SOC started shipping the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier developer kit and introduced the NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation server with DRIVE Sim software to safely test drive autonomous vehicles over billions of miles in virtual reality by leveraging NVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA DRIVE PegasusIn addition we launched the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier module to help build the nextgeneration of autonomous machines and announced that Yamaha Motor Co will use NVIDIA to power its upcoming lineup of autonomous machines25Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or US GAAP The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilitiesWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10KRevenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales including hardware and systems license and development arrangements and software licensing We determine revenue recognition through the following steps 1 identification of the contract with a customer 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligationProduct Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns customer programs and any taxes collected from customersFor products sold with a right of return we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returnsOur customer programs involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets and marketing development funds or MDFs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customersLicense and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components As a result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period we record a provision for such loss in that periodSoftware LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software Software licenses are frequently sold along with postcontract customer support or PCS For such arrangements we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performedRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information26Table of ContentsInventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditionsSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition In addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventoryThe overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 20 in fiscal year 2019 and insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 The higher amount of charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess DRAM other components and prior architecture components and chips whereas the charges we took during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of GPU and Tegra products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products As a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand In doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints We also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions all of which may impact demand for our productsRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussionIncome TaxesWe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realizedOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordinglyAs of January 27 2019 we had a valuation allowance of 562 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the periodWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense The TCJA which was enacted in December 2017 significantly changed US tax law including a reduction of the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes global intangible lowtaxed income or GILTI on certain foreignsource earnings As a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019 The SEC had provided guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act SAB 118 which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period up to one year 27Table of Contentsfrom the enactment date As of January 27 2019 we completed our accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the TCJA and elected to account for GILTI in deferred taxes Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information specific to accounting for income taxes and the impacts from the enactment of the TCJAGoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value We have identified two reporting units GPU and Tegra Processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis Goodwill assigned to the GPU and Tegra Processor reporting units as of January 27 2019 was 210 million and 408 million respectively Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertainDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 we used the qualitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit and concluded there was no impairmentRefer to Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional informationCash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesCash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased We measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value The fair values of our financial assets are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets All of our availableforsale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments We performed an impairment review of our debt investment portfolio as of January 27 2019 We concluded that our debt investments were appropriately valued and that no otherthantemporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of availableforsale debt investments as of January 27 2019Refer to

expense is associated with restricted stock units or RSUs performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or PSUs performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased PSUs and our employee stock purchase plan The number of PSUs and marketbased PSUs that will ultimately be awarded is contingent on the Companys level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our Compensation Committee in the beginning of each fiscal yearRefer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional informationLitigation Investigation and Settlement CostsFrom time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies We are aggressively defending our current litigation matters However there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments If that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with US GAAP However the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs28Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table sets forth for the periods

including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased 21 due primarily to higher sales across desktop and mobile workstation products Our PC OEM revenue decreased by 1 driven by the absence of Intel licensing revenue in fiscal year 2019 Revenue from cryptocurrencyspecific products in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 306 million and 273 million respectively We expect cryptocurrencyrelated revenue to be negligible going forwardGPU business revenue increased by 40 in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 led by growth in gaming datacenter and professional visualization Revenue from sales of GeForce GPU products for gaming increased over 20 reflecting continued strong demand for our Pascalbased GPU products Datacenter revenue including Tesla GRID and DGX increased 133 reflecting strong demand from hyperscale and cloud customers for deep learning training and accelerated GPU computing as well as demand for HPC DGX AI supercomputing and GRID virtualization platforms Revenue from Quadro GPUs for professional visualization increased by 12 due primarily to higher sales in both highend desktop and mobile 29Table of Contentsworkstation products Revenue from GeForce GPU products for mainstream PC OEMs increased by over 90 due primarily to strong demand for GPU products targeted for cryptocurrency miningTegra Processor Business  Tegra Processor business revenue was up slightly in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 This was driven by an increase of over 15 in automotive revenue primarily from infotainment modules production DRIVE PX platforms and development agreements with automotive companies offset by a decline of approximately 15 in SOC modules for gaming platforms and related development servicesTegra Processor business revenue increased by 86 in fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 This was driven by an increase of over 300 in revenue from SOC modules for gaming platforms and development services and an increase of 15 in automotive revenue primarily from infotainment modules DRIVE PX platforms and development agreements for selfdriving carsAll Other Our patent license agreement with Intel concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 For fiscal year 2018 we recognized related revenue of 43 million down from 264 million for fiscal year 2017 Concentration of RevenueRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 87 of total revenue for each of fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different locationNo single customer represented more than 10 of total revenue for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 In fiscal year 2017 we had one customer that represented 12 of our total revenue  Gross Profit and Gross MarginGross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions memory and component costs and shipping costs Cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing Our overall gross margin was 612 599 and 588 for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively The increase in fiscal year 2019 reflects our continued shift toward highervalue platforms which more than offset the impact of approximately 128 million in charges for excess DRAM and other components we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and a charge of 57 million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to prior architecture components and chips The increase in fiscal year 2018 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix the growth of our GeForce gaming GPU revenue and the growth of our datacenter revenue for cloud deep learning AI and graphics virtualization The increase in fiscal year 2018 was partially offset by the conclusion of our patent license agreement with Intel in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018Inventory provisions totaled 270 million 48 million and 62 million for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively Sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 41 million 35 million and 51 million for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively As a result the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 20 in fiscal year 2019 and insignificant in fiscal years 2018 and 2017A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows GPU Business The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2019 when compared to fiscal year 2018 primarily due to strong sales of highend GeForce gaming GPUs and revenue growth in Datacenter including Tesla GRID and DGX for cloud deep learning AI and graphics virtualization The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2018 when compared to fiscal

marketable securities Interest income was 136 million 69 million and 54 million in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances and higher rates from our floating rate securities and the purchase of new securitiesInterest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 220 Notes Due 2021 and 320 Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016 and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2013 Interest expense was 58 million 61 million and 58 million in fiscal years

Notes during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively Income TaxesThe TCJA which was enacted in December 2017 significantly changed US tax law including a reduction of the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes GILTI on certain foreignsource earnings As a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 201931Table of ContentsWe recognized income tax benefit of 245 million for fiscal year 2019 and income tax expense of 149 million and 239 million for fiscal years 2018 and 2017

2018 and 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in the US statutory tax rate from 339 to 21 the finalization of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the TCJA higher US federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation in fiscal year 2019The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the tax law changes and recognition of excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensationOur effective tax rate  for fiscal year 2019 was lower than the US federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate was lower than the US federal statutory tax rates the finalization of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the TCJA favorable recognition of US federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensationOur effective tax rate  for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was lower than the blended US federal statutory rate of 339 for fiscal year 2018 and 35 for fiscal year 2017 due primarily to income earned in

research tax credits the provisional impact of the tax law changes in 2018 and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensationIn fiscal year 2018 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 we recorded provisional amounts for certain enactmentdate effects of the TCJA by applying the SEC guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our accounting for these effects  Furthermore under US GAAP we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes  Because we were still evaluating the GILTI provisions as of January 28 2018 we recorded no GILTIrelated deferred balances  After further evaluation we elected to account for GILTI deferred taxes  As of January 27 2019 we completed our accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the TCJA and recognized a reduction of 368 million to the provisional amount recorded at January 28 2018

investment portfolio and outstanding debt The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businessesAs of January 27 2019 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments According to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 05 would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of 8 million or an increase in fair value for these investments of 7 million respectively In fiscal year 2017 we issued 100 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and 100 billion of the Notes Due 2026 We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information 34Table of ContentsForeign Exchange Rate RiskWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 Sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete Conversely decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us Additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than US dollars Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occurWe also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than US dollar These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment Therefore the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income or expenseRefer to Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

Significant Accounting PoliciesOur CompanyHeadquartered in Santa Clara California NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998 All references to NVIDIA we us our or the Company mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiariesFiscal YearWe operate on a 52 or 53week year ending on the last Sunday in January Fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 were 52week yearsReclassificationsCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentationPrinciples of ConsolidationOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our whollyowned subsidiaries All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidationUse of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ materially from our estimates On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation litigation investigation and settlement costs restructuring and other charges and other contingencies These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonableRevenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales including hardware and systems license and development arrangements and software licensing We determine revenue recognition through the following steps 1 identification of the contract with a customer 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5 recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligationProduct Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns customer programs and any taxes collected from customersFor products sold with a right of return we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returnsOur customer programs involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets and marketing development funds or MDFs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers47Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedLicense and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components As a result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period we record a provision for such loss in that periodSoftware LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software Software licenses are frequently sold along with postcontract customer support or PCS For such arrangements we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performedAdvertising ExpensesWe expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 were 21 million 25 million and 17 million respectively Product WarrantiesWe generally offer a limited warranty to endusers that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition Under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimatedStockbased CompensationWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or RSUs and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or PSUs We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased PSUs The compensation expense for RSUs and marketbased PSUs is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or ESPP using the BlackScholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year Stockbased compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model Additionally we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimatesLitigation Investigation and Settlement CostsFrom time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with US GAAP However the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costsForeign Currency RemeasurementWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at endofperiod exchange rates Nonmonetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates Gains or losses from foreign currency 48Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedremeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significantIncome TaxesWe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realizedOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordinglyAs of January 27 2019 we had a valuation allowance of 562 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the periodWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA which was enacted in December 2017 significantly changes US tax law including a reduction of the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes global intangible lowtaxed income or GILTI on certain foreignsource earnings As a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019 The Securities and Exchange Commission or the SEC had provided guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act SAB 118 which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period up to one year from the enactment date As of January 27 2019 we completed our accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the TCJA and elected to account for GILTI in deferred taxes Refer to Note 13 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional informationNet Income Per ShareBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method Under the treasury stock method the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is antidilutive Additionally we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that required us upon conversion to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock Our Convertible Notes Note Hedges and related Warrants contained various conversion features which are further described in Note 11 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The potentially dilutive shares resulting from the Convertible Notes and Warrants under the treasury stock method were included in the calculation of diluted income per share when their inclusion was dilutive However the Note Hedges were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share unless actually exercised as their preexercised effect would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method49Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedCash and Cash EquivalentsWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents Marketable SecuritiesMarketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as availableforsale These debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss a component of shareholders equity net of tax The fair value of interestbearing debt securities includes accrued interest Any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income or expense net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income or expense net section of our Consolidated Statements of IncomeAll of our availableforsale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review We record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments If the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthantemporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument In these situations we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value For availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors The credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or lossFair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying value of cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 27 2019 and January 28 2018 Marketable securities are comprised of availableforsale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss a component of shareholders equity net of tax Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged For derivative instruments designated as cashflow hedges the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings  For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting changes in fair value are recognized in earningsConcentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents marketable securities and accounts receivable Our investment policy requires the purchase of highlyrated fixed income securities the diversification of investment type and credit exposures and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration Accounts receivable from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total accounts receivable aggregated approximately 19 of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 27 2019 and 28 of our account receivable balance from two customers as of January 28 2018 We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit50Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedAccounts ReceivableWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of creditInventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout and shipping costs as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions Once inventory has been writtenoff or writtendown it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently writtenup Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets generally three to five years Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and a gain or loss is recorded The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the assetGoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  For the purposes of completing our impairment test we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting units fair value The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business Refer to Note 5 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Intangible Assets and Other LongLived AssetsIntangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses patents acquired intellectual property trademarks and customer relationships We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern cannot be reliably determined using a straightline amortization method Longlived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the 51Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedConsolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciatedAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsThe Financial Accounting Standards Board or FASB issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under US GAAP for all companies in all industries We adopted this guidance on January 29 2018 using the modified retrospective approach Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional informationIn January 2016 the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments We are now required to recognize changes in the fair value of our equity investments through net income rather than other comprehensive income We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and applied it prospectively The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial StatementsRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted The FASB issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases under which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for lease terms of more than 12 months We will adopt this guidance using the optional transition method at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 and will not restate comparative prior periods Additionally we will elect the package of practical expedients as permitted by the guidance We are in the process of finalizing changes to our systems and processes in conjunction with our review of lease agreements and currently expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately 500 million  In June 2016 the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates We will be required to use a forwardlooking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments including availableforsale debt securities The standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 with early adoption permitted We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our Consolidated Financial StatementsNote 2 New Revenue Accounting StandardMethod and Impact of AdoptionOn January 29 2018 we adopted the new revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective method and applied it to contracts that were not completed as of that date Upon adoption we recognized the cumulative effect of the new standard as a 7 million increase to opening retained earnings net of tax Comparative information for prior periods has not been adjusted The impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2019 was not significantDeferred Revenue and Performance Obligations Deferred

therefore the fair values of RSUs PSUs and marketbased PSUs are discounted for the dividend yieldAdditionally for RSU PSU and marketbased PSU awards we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the

Longterm deferred tax assets are included in Other assets and longterm deferred tax liabilities are included in Other longterm liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets We recognized an income tax benefit of 245 million for fiscal year 2019 and income tax expense of 149 million and 239 million for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively Our annual effective tax rate was 63 47 and 125 for fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively In December 2017 the TCJA was enacted into law The TCJA significantly changed US tax law including a reduction of the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 a requirement for companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new taxes global intangible lowtaxed income or GILTI on certain foreignsource earnings As a fiscal yearend taxpayer certain provisions of the TCJA began to impact us in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 while other provisions impacted us beginning in fiscal year 2019In fiscal year 2018 and the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 we recorded provisional amounts for certain enactmentdate effects of the TCJA by applying the SEC guidance in SAB 118 because we had not yet completed our accounting for these effects  As of January 27 2019 we completed our accounting for all of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the TCJA and recognized a reduction of 368 million to the provisional amount recorded at January 28 2018 as a component of income tax expense benefit  This adjustment primarily relates to the effects of electing to account for GILTI in deferred taxes as described below Our final tax benefit from the TCJA was 501 million  The onetime transition tax is based on the post1986 earnings and profits or EP of our foreign subsidiaries We had previously accrued deferred taxes on a portion of these same earnings We recorded a provisional onetime transition tax liability of 971 million at January 28 2018 Upon further analysis of the TCJA and Notices and regulations issued by the US Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service we finalized our calculations of the transition tax liability during fiscal year 2019  For fiscal year 2019 we increased our transition tax provisional amount by 33 millionAs a result of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21 companies were required to remeasure their deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment As a result at January 28 2018 we had recorded a provisional income tax expense of 43 million on the writedown of our deferred tax balance  Upon further analysis of certain aspects of the TJCA including immediate expensing of qualified capital expenditures and refinement of our calculations we reduced our provisional tax expense amount by 20 million67Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe TCJA subjects a US corporation to tax on its GILTI Under US GAAP we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes  Because we were still evaluating the GILTI provisions as of January 28 2018 we recorded no GILTIrelated deferred balances  After further evaluation we elected to account for GILTI deferred taxes  In fiscal year 2019 we recorded additional deferred tax assets as a net 370 million income tax benefit related to GILTI in deferred taxes   The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in the US statutory tax rate from 339 to 21 the finalization of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the TCJA higher US federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation in fiscal year 2019 The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the provisional impact of the tax law changes and recognition of excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensationOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 was lower than the US federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands Hong Kong China Taiwan and United Kingdom where the tax rate was lower than the US federal statutory tax rates the finalization of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the TCJA  favorable recognition of the US federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensationOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was lower than the blended US federal statutory rate of 339 for fiscal year 2018 and 35 for fiscal year 2017 due primarily

of US federal research tax credits the provisional impact of the tax law changes in 2018 and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensationAs of January 27 2019 and January 28 2018 we had a

of future taxable income To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the periodAs of

utilizationAs of January 27 2019 we had 477 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 432 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized However approximately 82 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken that if recognized would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance The 432 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 27 2019 consisted of 142 million recorded in noncurrent income taxes payable and 290 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets68Table of ContentsNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as

operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments We report our business in two primary reportable segments the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business based on a single underlying graphics architecture Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers Quadro for designers Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers and GRID for cloudbased visual computing users Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip and incorporates GPUs and multicore CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots drones and cars as well as for game consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devicesUnder the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments our CODM assigns 100 of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most The All Other category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stockbased compensation expense corporate infrastructure and support costs acquisitionrelated costs legal settlement costs contributions restructuring and other charges product warranty charge and other nonrecurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise
