that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below Any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation which could cause our stock price to decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment Additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business financial condition results of operations or reputation Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets or to identify new products services or technologies our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted Our GPUbased visual and accelerated computing platforms address four large markets Gaming Professional Visualization Data Center and Automotive These markets often experience rapid technological change changes in customer requirements new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards Our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new or enhance our existing products services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets Such activities may require considerable technical financial compliance sales and marketing investments We devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history such as the automotive and data center markets which presents additional risks to our business For example we must continue to accurately forecast demand scale and optimize utilization in our data center business and develop and deliver nextgeneration autonomous driving solutions to our partners and customers or our business could be negatively impacted We also must continue to scale our networking business following the Mellanox acquisition by leveraging our joint product capabilities and continuing to effectively integrate company processes We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas including customer service and support ecommerce and intellectual property or IP licensing capabilities If we do not continue to evolve our business including by developing 13 Table of Contents market specific technologies managing the social and environmental impact of our products and technologies expanding the ecosystem for our current and future products and technologies and monetizing and expanding our business in various areas our financial results could be negatively impacted We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards which are subject to change including those applicable to our automotive solutions and systems Additionally we continue to make considerable investments in research and development which may not produce significant revenue for several years if at all If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products services and technologies or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted our business revenue financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers partners and ultimately our shareholders If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities our business will be harmed For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor including for our interconnect products Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers Additionally if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards including safety standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies Furthermore winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated if any Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue Our target markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets Our competitors products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or better features than ours which may result among other things in lower than expected selling prices for our products In addition some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities have longer operating histories larger customer bases more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their products including semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business In our networking business some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and already have inhouse expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours Licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the transfer of intellectual property rights that may enable such customers to develop their own products and solutions to replace those we are currently providing to them Consequently these customers may become competitors to us Further each new design by a customer presents a competitive situation If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment including in significant international markets such as China demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer In addition the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation which could lead to fewer customers partners or suppliers any of which could negatively affect our financial results Risks Related to Our Supply and Manufacturing We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yields development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility Instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques Similarly we do not directly assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors In the past we have not had and going forward we may not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors Nevertheless we may enter into longterm procurement and capacity commitments 14 Table of Contents as our business grows or in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain As our business grows we must continue to scale and adapt our supply chain or it could have an adverse impact on our business As a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand scale our supply chain andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results including a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices which could be impacted by our failure to correctly estimate demand and to place orders with our suppliers in sufficient quantities andor in a timely manner a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our products a failure by our foundries to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis a limited number of suppliers including foundries assembly and test providers and memory manufacturers loss of a supplier and additional expense andor production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality and delays in product shipments shortages a decrease in product quality andor higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors orders over our orders or otherwise In addition low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand increase manufacturing costs harm customer or partner relationships andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry As a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem We also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner In the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could decline If we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmed If our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share Our products including both hardware and software offerings are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices markets technologies and applications including into the automotive market or as new versions are released Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services Failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs ODMs AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs writeoff the value of related inventory cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue In addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in 15 Table of Contents failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers perceptions of our brand Also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field A product recall including automotive recalls or recalls due to a bug in our products or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation harm our ability to attract new customers result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits If a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business Further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial results Risks Related to Our Operating Business If we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory and make our demand forecast more uncertain We sell many of our products through a channel model and our channel customers sell to retailers distributors andor end customers As a result the decisions made by our channel partners retailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pentup demand In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain we may place noncancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply which could negatively impact our financial results Demand for our products is based on many factors including our product introductions and transitions competitor announcements and competing technologies all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue For example our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly Volatility in the cryptocurrency market including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including but not limited to the pending Ethereum 20 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs Additionally consumer behavior during the COVID19 pandemic such as increased demand for our Gaming Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside In estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect If we are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our products our business and financial results could be adversely impacted Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions including downturns in our target markets andor overall economy changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit market a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products less demand than expected for newlyintroduced products or increased competition including competitive pricing actions The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins In addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals We could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial results 16 Table of Contents Conversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events In such cases even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner If we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged System security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation Security breaches computer malware phishing and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years These threats are constantly evolving making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future Experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time For portions of our IT infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems For example in 2020 SolarWinds Inc one of our third party software service providers was subject to a data security breach To date our investigations of this breach which were supported by a third party expert have not identified any adverse impact to NVIDIA Data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systems To defend against security threats both to our internal systems and those of our customers we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features which may result in increased expenses We must also continue to develop security measures within NVIDIA ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers or our business could be negatively impacted Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability paying damages regulatory inquiries or actions damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful We may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions Delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation Business disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages outages at cloud service providers tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions cyberattacks terrorist attacks medical epidemics or pandemics including but not limited to COVID19 and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations Such risks are discussed further in the risk factor The COVID19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California and other critical business operations finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in Asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity In addition a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in California making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas The manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including Taiwan China Hong Kong Israel and Korea Additionally a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong Israel and Taiwan Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements trade policies import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies product demand access to global markets hiring and profitability In particular revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement 17 Table of Contents could result in increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import duties or tariffs restrictions and controls on imports or exports or other retaliatory actions which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments For example regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans Catastrophic events can also have an impact on thirdparty vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel In addition geopolitical and domestic political developments such as existing and potential trade wars political or social unrest elections and postelection developments and other events beyond our control can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets Political instability changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business financial condition and results of operations Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages other negative impacts from climate change information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues The ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the thirdparty systems on which we rely our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue increases in expenses substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results The COVID19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations COVID19 has spread worldwide resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and shutdowns These measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and our partners and those of our respective vendors and suppliers including our subcontractors and thirdparty contract manufacturers Our critical business operations including our headquarters most of our finished goods inventory and many of our key suppliers are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID19 Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID19 related restrictions and closures The COVID19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty It continues to affect our business in both positive and negative ways and there is uncertainty around their duration and impact In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 our Gaming and Data Center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work learn and play from home Our Professional Visualization market platform benefited from workfromhome trends in mobile workstations and desktop workstation demand has started to recover although not back to preCOVID levels In our Automotive market platform COVID19 did not have a significant impact on demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 In some regions markets or industries where COVID19 has driven an increase in sales for our products the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change Additionally stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain particularly in Gaming which could cause us to order an excess amount if demand changes pay higher prices or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all As the COVID19 pandemic continues the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results The manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including Taiwan China Hong Kong Israel and Korea A significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong Israel and Taiwan Additionally our headquarters is located in California Each of these countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain it including restrictions on manufacturing facilities commerce travel on our support operations or workforce or on our customers partners vendors and suppliers There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures Such measures as well as restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations The spread of COVID19 has caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel mandatory workfromhome policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners and suppliers Most of our employees continue to work remotely There is no 18 Table of Contents certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed While the extent and duration of the COVID19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict the pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruption of global financial markets which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers ability to pay us for past or future purchases which could negatively affect our liquidity A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID19 could impact overall technology spending adversely affecting demand for our products our business and the value of our common stock The ultimate impact of the COVID19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change The extent of the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame will depend on future developments including but not limited to the duration and continued spread of the pandemic its severity the actions to contain the disease or treat its impact availability of vaccines or other treatments further related restrictions on travel and the duration timing and severity of the impact on customer spending including any recession resulting from the pandemic all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business results of operations access to sources of liquidity and financial condition though the full extent and duration is uncertain We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or investments including the Mellanox acquisition and the planned Arm acquisition and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products We have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products strategic objectives and business We completed our acquisition of Mellanox for approximately 7 billion in April 2020 In September 2020 we announced our agreement to acquire all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at 40 billion The Mellanox acquisition the planned Arm acquisition and future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results Given that our resources are limited our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives Furthermore if we are unable to complete acquisitions in a timely manner including due to delays in obtaining regulatory approvals we may be unable to pursue other transactions we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company technology may evolve making the acquisition less attractive and other changes can take place which could jeopardize or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business In addition we have made and may in the future make strategic investments in private companies and may not realize a return on our investments Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition the planned Arm acquisition and other acquisitions or strategic investments include but are not limited to difficulty in combining the technology products or operations of the acquired business with our business difficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce including key employees diversion of capital and other resources including managements attention assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses impairment charges to goodwill or writedowns of acquired assets integrating financial forecasting and controls procedures and reporting cycles coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated acquiring business challenges and risks including but not limited to disputes with management and integrating international operations and joint ventures difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return if any return at all difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals other approvals or financing 19 Table of Contents the potential impact of with complying with governmental or other regulatory restrictions placed on an acquisition the potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition are required to pay reverse breakup fees or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the potential variability of the amount and form of any performancebased consideration uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment if at all negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate the need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet our expectations potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company and impairment of relationships with or loss of our or our targets employees vendors and customers as a result of our acquisition or investment We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network With several of these distributors and partners we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors In the future these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty our partners may develop their own solutions our customers may purchase products from our competitors or our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products We could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to US trade restrictions The loss of any of our large customers a significant reduction in purchases by them or our inability to sell to a customer due to US trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers In the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations including adverse economic conditions which may harm our business We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States We allocate revenue 20 Table of Contents to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location Revenue from sales outside of the United States accounted for 81 of total revenue for fiscal year 2021 92 for fiscal year 2020 and 87 for fiscal year 2019 Revenue from billings to China including Hong Kong was 23 of our revenue for fiscal year 2021 Additionally as of January 31 2021 approximately 53 of our employees were located outside of the United States The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including international economic and political conditions and other political tensions between countries in which we do business unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in tax laws and employee safety and health regulations and those applicable to business acquisitions differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions including deemed export restrictions tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations such as carbon taxes fuel or energy taxes and pollution limits and natural disasters public health issues including the COVID19 pandemic discussed further in the risk factor The COVID19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations above and other catastrophic events If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions affecting our operations in areas including but not limited to IP ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements competition advertising employment product regulations environment health and safety requirements and consumer laws Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacyrelated and data protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads Although we have policies controls and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers or agents will not violate such laws or our policies Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation The technology industry is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which can increase our exposure to government investigations legal actions and penalties Adverse changes in global regional or local economic conditions including recession or slowing growth changes or uncertainty in fiscal monetary or trade policy higher interest rates tighter credit inflation lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure increases in unemployment and lower consumer confidence and spending periodically occur The COVID19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty It is likely that the continued spread of COVID19 will cause an economic slowdown and it is possible that it could cause a global recession Adverse changes in economic conditions including as a result of the pandemic can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions including regarding prioritization of investments in our business A slowdown in economic growth could have adverse wideranging effects on our business and financial results including a decrease in demand for our products and technologies a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us our inability to supply our products to our customers andor the 21 Table of Contents inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users the insolvency of key suppliers customers or licensees delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees failures by counterparties andor negative effects on inventories Uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit businesses merge with other manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales additional inventory or bad debt expense Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect our ability to manage operations and deliver our products These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets reduced liquidity adverse impacts on our suppliers failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers asset impairments and declines in the value of our financial instruments Additionally we have engineering facilities corporate and sales support operations and some of our manufacturing located in Israel Accordingly political economic and military conditions in Israel and the Middle East may directly affect our business In addition the State of Israel and companies with business in Israel have in the past been the subject of an economic boycott and could be in the future Other countries have in the past and may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel and companies with Israeli operations Further we are unable to ship products manufactured in Israel to certain countries These laws and policies may have an impact on our results of operations Any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of such events could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations If we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executives and key employees The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive In particular hiring qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business We also must recruit and develop diverse talent Additionally changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected Additionally competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stockbased compensation The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs We also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and negatively impact our business Effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution We continue to evolve our business practices in response to the COVID19 pandemic by supporting and providing resources to our employees who are working remotely and implementing stringent safety guidelines for those who go into the essential labs and offices that remain open If we do not continue to anticipate and address the safety and wellness needs of our employees sufficiently andor in a timely manner their productivity could be impacted or we could fail to retain them Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors Therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance Additional factors other than or in addition to those described elsewhere in these risk factors that could affect our results of operations in the future include but are not limited to our ability to achieve volume production of our nextgeneration products our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multiyear development cycle for some of our products and services fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies and COVID19 as discussed further in the risk factor If we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmed 22 Table of Contents changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners products our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers contractual obligations product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products inventory writedowns our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems and our partner networks ability to sell products that incorporate our technologies our dependence on third party vendors and end users to adopt our products including InfiniBand the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers customer bad debt writeoffs any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property our ability to maintain and scale our business processes information systems and internal controls changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards and general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility Risks Related to Regulatory Legal Our Common Stock and Other Matters Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products We have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others regardless of their merit could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to defend and resolve such claims and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results Further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third partys patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third partys patent or other intellectual property rights However we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted Furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 23 Table of Contents Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property To accomplish this we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely In addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced We also may face risks to our intellectual property if our employees are hired by potential competitors We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation deter current and potential users from using our products and services result in liability or result in legal or regulatory proceedings Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacyrelated matters including for use in AI even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results The theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs damage to our reputation regulatory proceedings disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection which continue to evolve and apply to our business For example the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR which required companies to meet requirements effective as of May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access correct and delete such data about themselves Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue In addition California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 or CCPA which took effect on January 1 2020 The CCPA gives California residents the right to access delete and optout of certain sharing of their personal information and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared Violations of the CCPA carry substantial civil penalties and the law creates a private right of action for certain data breaches which is expected to increase data breach litigation Californias privacy laws will expand substantially effective January 1 2023 as a result of California voters approving the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 or CPRA in the November 2020 election The CPRA will among other things restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information further restrict the use of crosscontextual advertising techniques establish restrictions on the retention of personal information expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law as well as impose administrative fines Since the enactment of the CCPA more than half of the states in the United States and the United States Congress have considered proposed privacy legislation reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices If so we may be ordered to change our data practices andor be fined Complying with these changing laws has caused and could continue to cause us to incur substantial costs which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations Further failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates As a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions For example we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in the United Kingdom Germany Israel and India Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable tax authorities may 24 Table of Contents disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows Further changes in United States federal and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the TCJA Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws changes in our business or statutory rates changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in available tax credits the resolution of issues arising from tax audits changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations the impact of accounting for stockbased compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur the impact of accounting for business combinations shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation investigations and regulatory proceedings We currently and may in the future face legal administrative and regulatory proceedings claims demands andor investigations involving shareholder consumer competition andor other issues relating to our business on a global basis For example we are currently defending ourselves in a shareholder lawsuit claiming that we and certain of our officers made false andor misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018 In addition multiple stockholders purporting to act on our behalf filed derivative lawsuits seeking to assert claims on our behalf against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends In addition regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations In addition the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in or remedy violations of these laws and regulations Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control Our status as a Delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders In addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock These provisions include the following the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval a supermajority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders and the ability of our Board of Directors to make amend or repeal our bylaws 25 Table of Contents On March 5 2000 we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox Under the agreement if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations In March 2020 we issued 150 billion of the 285 Notes Due 2030 100 billion of the 350 Notes Due 2040 200 billion of the 350 Notes Due 2050 and 500 million of the 370 Notes Due 2060 or collectively the March 2020 Notes In September 2016 we issued 100 billion of the 220 Notes Due 2021 and 100 billion of the 320 Notes Due 2026 or collectively the September 2016 Notes Our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes Additionally our obligation to make payments related to the Notes could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs including working capital capital expenditures acquisitions investments and other general corporate purposes ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable ITEM 2 PROPERTIES Our headquarters complex is located in Santa Clara California It includes ten leased commercial buildings totaling 1019887 square feet and real property that we own totaling 720046 square feet Our owned property consists of two commercial buildings and a building under construction The

Financial Statements and related Notes thereto as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K before deciding to purchase hold or sell shares of our common stock Overview Our Company and Our Businesses NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems Starting with a focus on PC graphics we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for virtual reality HPC and AI Through fiscal year 2020 our reportable segments were GPU and Tegra Processor We changed our reportable segments to Graphics and Compute Networking starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure and solutions for gaming platforms QuadroNVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics vGPU software for cloudbased visual and virtual computing and automotive platforms for infotainment systems Our Compute Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI HPC and accelerated computing Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions automotive AI Cockpit autonomous driving development agreements and autonomous vehicle solutions and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms All prior period comparisons presented reflect our new reportable segments Our market platforms Gaming Professional Visualization Data Center Automotive OEM and Other remain unchanged Headquartered in Santa Clara California NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998 Recent Developments Future Objectives and Challenges Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited On September 13 2020 we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire from SoftBank all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at 40 billion We paid 2 billion in cash at signing or the Signing Consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition 10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 443 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of 215 billion The transaction includes a potential earn out which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31 2022 If the financial performance targets are achieved Softbank can elect to receive either up to an additional 5 billion in cash or up to an additional 103 million shares of our common stock We will issue up to 15 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing The 2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of 136 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of 017 billion and royalties of 047 billion both with a 20year term The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period and Arms implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arms IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities We are engaged with regulators in the United States the United Kingdom the European Union China and other jurisdictions If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances we will be refunded 125 billion of the Signing Consideration The 2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022 Demand Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory and make our demand forecast more uncertain We sell many of our products through a channel model and our channel customers sell to retailers distributors andor end customers As a result the decisions made 29 Table of Contents by our channel partners retailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pentup demand In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain we may place noncancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply which could negatively impact our financial results Demand for our products is based on many factors including our product introductions and transitions competitor announcements and competing technologies all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue For example our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly Volatility in the cryptocurrency market including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including but not limited to the pending Ethereum 20 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs Additionally consumer behavior during the COVID19 pandemic such as increased demand for our Gaming Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside In estimating demand and evaluating trends we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect COVID19 The worldwide COVID19 pandemic is prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including restrictions on travel temporary business closures quarantines and shelterinplace orders It has significantly impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets Since March 2020 most of our employees have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business travel Our Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work learn and play from home In Professional Visualization mobile workstations continue to benefit from workfromhome trends and desktop workstation demand has started to recover although not back to preCOVID levels In Automotive COVID is no longer having a significant impact on demand Throughout our supply chain stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components particularly in Gaming As the COVID19 pandemic continues the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results Refer to Part I Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information under the heading Risk Factors We believe our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities along with commercial paper and other shortterm liquidity arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs capital asset purchases dividends debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations Fiscal Year 2021 Summary Year Ended January 31 2021 January 26 2020 Change in millions except per share data Revenue 16675 10918 Up 53 Gross margin 623 620 Up 30 bps Operating expenses 5864 3922 Up 50 Income from operations 4532 2846 Up 59 Net income 4332 2796 Up 55 Net income per diluted share 690 452 Up 53 Revenue for fiscal year 2021 was 1668 billion up 53 from a year earlier 30 Table of Contents From a marketplatform perspective Gaming revenue was up 41 from a year ago reflecting higher sales across desktop and laptop GPUs for gaming and gameconsole SOCs GPUs for gaming benefited from the ramp of our GeForce RTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture Professional Visualization revenue was down 13 from a year ago due to lower sales of GPUs for desktop workstations as enterprise demand was impacted by COVID Data Center revenue was up 124 from a year ago Revenue growth was driven by our Mellanox acquisition and the ramp of the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture In fiscal year 2021 Mellanox revenue contributed 10 of total company revenue Automotive revenue was down 23 from a year earlier reflecting lower revenue from the expected ramp down of legacy infotainment modules and autonomous driving development agreements partially offset by increases in AI cockpit and autonomous vehicle solutions OEM and Other revenue was up 25 from a year ago primarily due to higher volume of entrylevel laptop GPUs Gross margin for fiscal year 2021 was up 30 basis points from a year ago primarily driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue partially offset by Mellanox acquisitionrelated charges Operating expenses for fiscal year 2021 were 586 billion up 50 from a year ago The growth was influenced by the inclusion of Mellanox in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 employee additions and increases in employee compensation and related expenses Additionally acquisitionrelated and other costs of 411 million primarily include 190 million in nonrecurring intangible amortization of Mellanox order backlog 123 million in recurring amortization of Mellanox intangible assets and 40 million related to the pending acquisition of Arm Income from operations for fiscal year 2021 was 453 billion up 59 from a year earlier Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2021 were 433 billion and 690 up 55 and 53 respectively from a year earlier Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 1156 billion as of January 31 2021 compared with 1090 billion as of January 26 2020 The increase primarily reflects the issuance of the 5 billion of notes in March 2020 and cashflow generation partially offset by acquisitions We paid 395 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2021 Market Platform Highlights During fiscal year 2021 in our Gaming platform we announced

standard with NVIDIA DRIVE invehicle infotainment systems starting in 2022 and expanded the NVIDIA DRIVE sensor ecosystem with new solutions Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or US GAAP The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to business combinations inventories revenue recognition income taxes and goodwill We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10K Business Combinations The application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date with the purchase price exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill Determining fair value of identifiable assets particularly intangibles liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates In certain circumstances the allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when we receive final information including appraisals and other analyses Accordingly the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information or the facts and circumstances becomes available but will not exceed twelve months We will recognize measurementperiod adjustments during the period of resolution including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date Goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination We recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold transferred licensed rented or exchanged either individually or in combination with a related contract asset or liability Intangible assets consist primarily of technology customer relationships order backlog and trade name acquired in a business combination and inprocess research and development or IPRD We generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques To estimate fair value we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions including future economic and market conditions revenue growth technology migration curve and riskadjusted discount rates Our estimates require significant judgment and are based on historical data various internal estimates and external sources Our assessment of IPRD also includes consideration of the risk of the projects not achieving technological feasibility Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly or 32 Table of Contents unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition In addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 As a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand In doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints We also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions all of which may impact demand for our products Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis for further discussion Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales including hardware and systems license and development arrangements and software licensing We determine revenue recognition through the following steps 1 identification of the contract with a customer 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation and 5 recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products Certain products are sold along with support or extended warranty Support and extended warranty revenue is recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performed Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns customer programs and any taxes collected from customers For products sold with a right of return we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns Our customer programs involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets and marketing development funds or MDFs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components As a result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period we record a provision for such loss in that period Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Income Taxes We recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change 33 Table of Contents based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly As of January 31 2021 we had a valuation allowance of 728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value We changed our reportable segments to Graphics and Compute Networking starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 As a result our reporting units also changed and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their relative fair values We determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately prior to the reorganization As of January 31 2021 the total carrying amount of goodwill was 419 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute Networking reporting units was 347 million and 385 billion respectively Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 is presented below A discussion regarding our financial condition and results

by 29 in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 reflecting growth in GeForce GPUs and game console SOCs partially offset by lower sales of QuadroNVIDIA RTX workstations Compute Networking Compute Networking segment revenue increased by 109 in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 reflecting the addition of Mellanox acquired on April 27 2020 and the continued ramp of NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture systems and new products Concentration of Revenue Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 81 and 92 of total revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location No customer represented 10 or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2021 Dell represented approximately 11 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit consists of total revenue net of allowances less cost of revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging board and device costs manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions memory and component costs and shipping costs Cost of 35 Table of Contents revenue also includes acquisitionrelated costs development costs for license and service arrangements IPrelated costs and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing Our overall gross margin was 623 and 620 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively The increase in fiscal year 2021 was driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue partially offset by Mellanox acquisitionrelated charges including a nonrecurring inventory stepup charge of 161 million and ongoing intangible asset amortization of 263 million Inventory provisions totaled 116 million and 161 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively Sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 145 million for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020 As a result the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in both fiscal years 2021 and 2020 A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows Graphics The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily driven by product mix with lower legacy automotive infotainment revenue and higher margin mix within QuadroNvidia RTX Compute Networking The gross margin of our Compute Networking segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020 primarily driven by the addition of Mellanox products higher margins in Data Center compute systems and lower product mix of certain Automotive solutions Operating Expenses Year Ended January 31 2021 January 26 2020 Change Change in millions

Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by 39 in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 driven primarily by the acquisition of Mellanox In addition the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs including stockbased compensation and infrastructure costs Sales General and Administrative Sales general and administrative expenses increased by 77 in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 driven primarily by the Mellanox acquisition In addition the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs including stockbased compensation Other Income Expense Net Interest income consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Interest income was 57 million and 178 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September 2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes Interest expense was 184 million and 52 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively Income Taxes We recognized income tax expense of 77 million and 174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively Our annual effective tax rate was 17 and 59 for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 respectively 36 Table of Contents The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stockbased compensation Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was lower than the US federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including the British Virgin Islands Israel and Hong Kong where the tax rate was lower than the US federal statutory tax rate recognition of US federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information

policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities the diversification of investment types and credit exposures and certain maturity limits on our portfolio In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 we paid 2 billion as part of the proposed acquisition of Arm which was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of 136 billion the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of 017 billion and royalties of 047 billion The cash flow allocation of the payment resulted in 136 billion of advanced consideration included in acquisitions net of cash acquired 017 billion for the intellectual property license included in purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and 047 billion in prepayment of royalties included in changes in prepaid expenses and other assets Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 due to higher net income higher noncash adjustments partially offset by changes in working capital Changes in working capital include increases in purchases of inventory and outstanding trade receivables both due to higher fiscal year 2021 revenue and a prepayment of royalties to Arm Cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2020 which primarily reflects cash used for the acquisition of Mellanox and the advanced consideration for the proposed acquisition of Arm higher purchases of marketable securities higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and lower sales of marketable securities offset by higher maturities of marketable securities Cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used in fiscal year 2020 which primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 offset by payments related to tax on restricted stock units 37 Table of Contents Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents our marketable securities and the cash generated by our operations As of January 31 2021 we had 1156 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months including our proposed acquisition of Arm We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources including our access to external capital to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements beyond twelve months Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the US government and its agencies highly rated corporations and financial institutions and foreign government entities and certificates of deposits These marketable securities are primarily denominated in US dollars Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information During fiscal year 2022 we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents our marketable securities and the cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately 10 billion to 12 billion related to property and equipment including construction of a new building at our Santa Clara campus We have approximately 138 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the US for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the US Other than that substantially all of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the US as of January 31 2021 are available for use in the US without incurring additional US federal income taxes Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Capital Return to Shareholders In fiscal year 2021 we paid 395 million in quarterly cash dividends Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Boards continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders As of January 31 2021 we were authorized subject to certain specifications to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to 724 billion through December 2022 We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2021 Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities We have outstanding 150 billion of Notes Due 2030 100 billion of Notes Due 2040 200 billion of Notes Due 2050 and 500 million of Notes due 2060 or collectively the March 2020 Notes We have outstanding 100 billion of Notes due 2021 and 100 billion of Notes due 2026 or collectively the September 2016 Notes We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to 575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to 425 million As of January 31 2021 we had not

Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further discussion Contractual Obligations We have 157 million of longterm tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox and unrecognized tax benefits of 395 million which includes related interest and penalties of 43 million recorded in noncurrent income tax payable as of January 31 2021 We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability interest payments or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 Refer to

for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment and Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixedrate investment portfolio and outstanding debt The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses As of January 31 2021 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio According to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 taking into account a yield floor of 0 would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of 24 million or an increase in fair value for these investments of 8 million respectively In September 2016 we issued 100 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and 100 billion of the Notes Due 2026 In March 2020 we issued 150 billion of Notes Due 2030 100 billion of Notes Due 2040 200 billion of Notes Due 2050 and 500 million of Notes due 2060 We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for additional information Foreign Exchange Rate Risk We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 Sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete Conversely decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us Additionally we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than US dollars Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than US dollar These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment Therefore the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income or expense If the US dollar strengthened by 10 as of January 31 2021 and January 26 2020 the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately 84 million and 43 million lower as of January 31 2021 and January 26 2020 respectively Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized 39 Table of Contents If an adverse 10 foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately 44 million and 29 million as of January 31 2021 and January 26 2020 respectively These changes in fair values would be offset in other income expense net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10K

Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a15f Under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31 2021 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31 2021 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included herein Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Other than the acquisition of Mellanox that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting despite the fact that virtually all of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID19 pandemic We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their operating effectiveness We are in the process of integrating Mellanox into our systems and control environment We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud A control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met Further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within NVIDIA have been detected 40 Table of Contents ITEM 9B OTHER INFORMATION None PART III Certain information required by

the circumstances We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 44 Table of Contents management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that i relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and ii involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matters below providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd Valuation of Developed Technology and Inprocess Research and Development Intangible Assets Acquired As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal year 2021 the Company completed the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd for consideration of approximately 713 billion of which 1640 million of developed technology and 630 million of inprocess research and development intangible assets were recorded The fair values of developed technology and inprocess research and development intangible assets were determined using the multiperiod excess earnings method As disclosed by management management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired which involved the use of certain estimates and assumptions including future economic and market conditions revenue growth the technology migration curve and riskadjusted discount rates The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the developed technology and inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd is a critical audit matter are i the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the fair value measurement of developed technology and inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate ii significant audit effort in evaluating managements assumptions relating to the estimate such as revenue growth and the technology migration curve and iii the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting including controls over managements valuation of the intangible assets and controls over development of the assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology migration curve These procedures also included among others reading the purchase agreement and testing managements process for estimating the fair value of the developed technology and inprocess research and development intangible assets acquired Testing managements process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of managements assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology migration curve for the intangible assets acquired and using professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist with the evaluation Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth involved considering the past performance of the acquired business as well as economic and industry forecasts The technology migration curve was evaluated by considering the revenue attribution between existing technology and inprocess research and development based on the assessment of the separation of forecasted future revenue between developed products and new generation products and the technology carryover rate Valuation of Inventories Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to writedown inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory Most of the Companys inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products based on the Companys inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions As 45 Table of Contents disclosed by management the inventory provisions developed include assumptions about future demand and market conditions As of January 31 2021 the Companys consolidated inventories balance was 1826 million The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories is a critical audit matter are the significant judgments by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions This in turn led to significant auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements assumptions related to future demand and market conditions Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements provisions for excess or obsolete inventories including controls over managements assumptions related to future demand and market conditions These procedures also included among others testing managements process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories evaluating the appropriateness of managements approach testing the completeness accuracy and relevance of underlying data used in the approach and evaluating the reasonableness of managements assumptions related to future demand and market conditions Evaluating managements assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering i current and past results including historical product life cycle ii the consistency with external market and industry data iii changes in technology and iv comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period s PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose California February 26 2021 We have served as the Companys auditor since 2004 46 Table of Contents NVIDIA

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Our Company Headquartered in Santa Clara California NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998 All references to NVIDIA we us our or the Company mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries Fiscal Year We operate on a 52 or 53week year ending on the last Sunday in January Fiscal year 2021 is a 53week year Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were both 52week years Reclassifications Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our whollyowned subsidiaries All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ materially from our estimates On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation litigation investigation and settlement costs restructuring and other charges and other contingencies The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID19 These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue from product sales including hardware and systems license and development arrangements and software licensing We determine revenue recognition through the following steps 1 identification of the contract with a customer 2 identification of the performance obligations in the contract 3 determination of the transaction price 4 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation and 5 recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation Product Sales Revenue Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products Certain products are sold along with support or extended warranty Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performed Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns customer programs and any taxes collected from customers For products sold with a right of return we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates However if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns Our customer programs involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets and marketing development funds or MDFs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting NVIDIA products We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers 52 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued License and Development Arrangements Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components As a result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period we record a provision for such loss in that period Software Licensing Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software Software licenses are frequently sold along with postcontract customer support or PCS Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period or as services are performed Product Warranties We generally offer a limited warranty to endusers that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition Under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated Stockbased Compensation We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or RSUs and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or PSUs We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased PSUs The compensation expense for RSUs and marketbased PSUs is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or ESPP using the BlackScholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year Stockbased compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model Additionally we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates Litigation Investigation and Settlement Costs From time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with US GAAP However the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs Foreign Currency Remeasurement We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at endofperiod exchange rates Nonmonetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant 53 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Income Taxes We recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction We recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances In addition we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly As of January 31 2021 we had a valuation allowance of 728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method Under the treasury stock method the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is antidilutive Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations We generally classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as availableforsale These availableforsale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss a component of shareholders equity net of tax The fair value of interestbearing debt securities includes accrued interest Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income expense net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income All of our availableforsale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review If the estimated fair value of an availableforsale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis we determine if the difference if any is caused by expected credit losses and writedown the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis Allowances for credit losses and writedowns are recognized in other income expense net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying value of cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 31 2021 and January 26 2020 Marketable securities are comprised of availableforsale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses 54 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss a component of shareholders equity net of tax Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged For derivative instruments designated as cashflow hedges the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting changes in fair value are recognized in earnings Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents marketable securities and accounts receivable Our investment policy requires the purchase of highlyrated fixed income securities the diversification of investment type and credit exposures and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit Accounts Receivable We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for expected losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit Inventories Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout and shipping costs as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions Once inventory has been writtenoff or writtendown it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently writtenup Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets generally three to five years Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and a gain or loss is recorded The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset Leases We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets accrued and other current liabilities and longterm operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments minus any lease incentives Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease 55 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option Lease expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term We combine the lease and nonlease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities Goodwill Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist For the purposes of completing our impairment test we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting units fair value The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business Intangible Assets and Other LongLived Assets Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology inprocess research and development or IPRD and customer relationships as well as rights acquired under technology licenses patents and acquired intellectual property We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from two to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern cannot be reliably determined using a straightline amortization method We initially capitalize the fair value of IPRD as an intangible asset with an indefinite life When IPRD projects are completed we reclassify the IPRD as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the assets estimated useful life Longlived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated Business Combination We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired including IPRD based on their estimated fair values The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill Managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives These estimates are inherently uncertain and therefore actual results may differ from the estimates made As a result during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income Acquisitionrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred 56 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Investment in NonAffiliated Entities Nonmarketable equity investments in privatelyheld companies are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the investee Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In June 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to replace the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates for accounts receivable and other financial instruments including availableforsale debt securities We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the impact of the adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements Note 2 Business Combination Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited On September 13 2020 we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire from SoftBank all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at 40 billion We paid 2 billion in Signing Consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition 10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 443 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of 215 billion The transaction includes a potential earn out which is contingent on the achievement of certain

intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31 2021 4 Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the RelieffromRoyalty Method under the income approach 5 The fair value of IPRD was determined using the MultiPeriod Excess Earnings Method The fair value of the finitelived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses Mellanox had an IPRD project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date Accordingly we recorded an indefinitelived intangible asset of 630 million for the fair value of this project which will initially not be amortized Instead the project will be tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be impaired or may have reached technological feasibility Once the project reaches technological feasibility we will begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life Supplemental Unaudited Pro

is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility For awards granted we use the dividend yield at grant date Our RSU PSU and marketbased PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair values of RSUs PSUs and marketbased PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield 61 Table of Contents NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Additionally for RSU PSU and marketbased PSU awards we estimate forfeitures semiannually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates Forfeitures are estimated based on historical

benefit of 245 million for fiscal year 2019 Our annual effective tax rate was 17 59 and 63 for fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stockbased compensation The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA and a decrease of tax benefits from stockbased compensation Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 2020 and 2019 was lower than the US federal statutory rate of 21 due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions including the British Virgin Islands Israel and Hong Kong where the tax rate was lower than the US federal statutory tax rate recognition of US federal research tax credits excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation and the finalization of the enactmentdate income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019 During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 we completed the acquisition of Mellanox As a result of the acquisition we recorded 256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries We also recorded 153 million of longterm tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox The net deferred tax liabilities and longterm tax liabilities are based upon certain assumptions underlying our purchase price allocation As a result of the acquisition as of January 31 2021 we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately 116 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings held by Mellanox nonUS subsidiaries We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in Mellanox nonUS subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable As of January 31 2021 and January 26 2020 we had a valuation allowance of 728 million and 621 million respectively related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due in part to jurisdictional projections of future taxable

credit carryforwards as applicable may expire or be denied before utilization As of January 31 2021 we had 776 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 606 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized However 132 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken that if recognized would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance The 606 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31 2021 consisted of 352 million recorded in noncurrent income taxes

anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense As of January 31 2021 January 26 2020 and January 27 2019 we had accrued 44 million 31 million and 21 million respectively for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits As of January 31 2021 unrecognized tax benefits of 352 million and the related interest and penalties of 43 million are included in noncurrent income taxes payable and unrecognized tax benefits of 5 million and the related interest and penalties of 1 million are included in current income taxes payable While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position Accordingly our provisions on federal state and foreign taxrelated matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved As of January 31 2021 we do not believe that our
