offerings focused on a specific functionality product area or industry In addition as we expand into new market segments we will face increased competition as we will compete with existing competitors as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed like Amazoncom Inc Moreover we or our competitors may take certain strategic actionsincluding acquisitions partnerships and joint ventures or repositioning of product lineswhich invite even greater competition in one or more product categories Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include total cost of ownership performance scalability reliability security functionality efficiency ease of management and quality of technical support Our product and service sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following among other things the adoption of cloud based IT offerings including softwareasaservice platformasaservice and infrastructureasaservice offerings the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors the broader platform competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the NET programming environment of Microsoft operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems with alternatives including Microsofts Windows Server and other UNIX and Linux operating systems the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers products features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff products features or functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants systems integrators or other third parties and attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers For more information about the competitive risks we face refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report Manufacturing To produce our hardware products we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement assembly testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers storage systems and networking products For all other manufacturing we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly testing and quality control processes for these components and products We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities Our manufacturing processes are based on standardization of components across product types centralization of assembly and distribution centers and a buildtoorder methodology in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials supplies product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of vendors For most of our hardware products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available However we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products As a result we continue to evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations Refer to Risk Factors included in Item 1A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business 15 Table of Contents Research and Development We develop the substantial majority of our products internally In addition we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology While we believe that our patents have value no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments Research and development expenditures were 52 billion 49 billion and 45 billion in each of fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively or 13 of total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 2013 and 12 in fiscal 2012 Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software and cloud and hardware markets in which we compete We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings Employees As of May 31 2014 we employed approximately 122000 fulltime employees including approximately 32000 in sales and marketing approximately 9000 in software license updates and product support approximately 5000 in our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS operations approximately 1000 in the manufacturing of our hardware systems products approximately 6000 in hardware systems support approximately 22000 in services approximately 36000 in research and development and approximately 11000 in general and administrative positions Of these employees approximately 45000 were employed in the United States and approximately 77000 were employed internationally None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union however in certain foreign subsidiaries labor unions or workers councils represent some of our employees Available Information Our Annual Report on Form 10K Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q Current Reports on Form 8K and amendments to reports filed pursuant to

Contents Item 1A Risk Factors We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict The following discussion as well as our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 highlights some of these risks The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities Economic political and market conditions can adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting These include general economic and business conditions overall demand for enterprise software cloud offerings hardware systems and services governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities general political developments and currency exchange rate fluctuations Macroeconomic developments like the continued slow pace of economic recovery in the United States and Europe and in parts of Asia and South America could negatively affect our business operating results financial condition and outlook which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Any general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology IT budgets and spending which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services In addition political unrest in places like Ukraine and its potential impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of new software licenses hardware systems products hardware systems support and related services and to a lesser extent also may affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support and our subscriptionbased cloud offerings We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors Our revenues particularly our new software licenses revenues and hardware systems revenues are difficult to forecast As a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially We use a pipeline system a common industry practice to forecast sales and trends in our business Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate A reduction in the conversion rate or in the pipeline itself could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations In particular a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms which can also impede our ability to negotiate execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner In addition for newly acquired companies we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition Conversion rates postacquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies historical conversion rates Differences in conversion rates can also be affected by changes in our business practices that we implement with our newly acquired companies that may affect customer behavior 18 Table of Contents A substantial portion of our new software licenses revenue contracts and hardware systems contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are larger orders Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability The number of large new software licenses transactions and to a lesser extent hardware systems products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions Our cloud computing strategy including our Oracle Cloud SoftwareasaService PlatformasaService and InfrastructureasaService offerings may not be successful We offer customers a broad portfolio of software cloud and hardware offerings and related services to enable customers to adopt a cloud computing strategy that is right for them These business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact pricing in both our onpremise enterprise software business and our cloud business as well as overall demand for our onpremise software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline Our cloud offerings are generally purchased by customers on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscriptions The deferred revenue that results from sales of our cloud offerings may prevent any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings from becoming immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations This is in contrast to revenues associated with our new software licenses arrangements whereby new software licenses revenues are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related software licenses We incur expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings To the extent customer demand for our cloud offerings increases we could experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our new software licenses arrangements and cloud offering arrangements We have also acquired a number of cloud computing companies and the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient or scalable as anticipated which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services Rapid technological advances and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services enhance and improve our products and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand customers may not purchase or subscribe for our software hardware or cloud offerings or renew software or hardware support contracts Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business In addition IT standards from both consortia and formal standardssetting forums as well as de facto marketplace standards are rapidly evolving We cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our software and hardware products and services including our Database InMemory Oracle Cloud and Oracle Engineered Systems offerings Our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames there is a delay in market acceptance of a new enhanced or acquired product line or service 19 Table of Contents there are changes in information technology trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services or we fail to adequately integrate support or enhance acquired product lines or services If our security measures for our software hardware services or Oracle Cloud offerings are compromised and as a result our data our customers data or our IT systems are accessed improperly made unavailable or improperly modified our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable our brand and reputation could be damaged the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using our products and services all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions We are in the information technology business and our products and services including our Oracle Cloud offerings store retrieve manipulate and manage our customers information and data as well as our own We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products services and the internal and external data that we manage Nevertheless we encounter attempts by third parties to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities penetrate or bypass our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our software hardware and cloud offerings networks and systems any of which could lead to the compromise of the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers Computer hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products and services exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our products and services create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service This is also true for third party products or services incorporated into our own Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data our customers data or our IT systems Although this is an industrywide problem that affects other software and hardware companies it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most prominent IT companies and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for and marketing efforts associated with having secure products and services These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of our customers confidential information and data and host or manage parts of our customers businesses in cloudbased IT environments especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences financial services and the government We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies products services and technologies over the years While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquisitions we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these acquisitions within Oracle If a cyber attack or other security incident described above were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers data or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted or if our products or services are perceived as having security vulnerabilities we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services including our cloud offerings and perceive them to be not secure This in turn could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenue and earnings The costs we would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits regulatory investigations and claims and increased legal liability including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring Further as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex these potential risks to our business will intensify Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data such as healthcare data or other personally identifiable information could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services 20 Table of Contents We might experience significant coding manufacturing or configuration errors in our software hardware and cloud offerings Despite testing prior to their release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service software hardware and cloud offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors that can impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences The detection and correction of any errors in released software hardware or cloud offerings can be time consuming and costly Errors in our software hardware or cloud offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other software hardware or cloud offerings could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services could result in creating security vulnerabilities in our products or services and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services This includes third party software products or services incorporated into our own If we experience errors or delays in releasing our software hardware or cloud offerings or new versions thereof our sales could be affected and revenues could decline In addition we run Oracles business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks Therefore any flaws could affect our ability to conduct our business operations and the operations of our customers Enterprise customers rely on our software and hardware products and services to run their businesses and errors in our software hardware or cloud offerings could expose us to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation which could impact our future sales If we are unable to compete effectively the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed Many vendors develop and market databases middleware products application development tools business applications collaboration products and business intelligence products among others that compete with our software and cloud offerings These vendors include onpremise software companies and companies that offer SaaS or cloud computing and business process outsourcing BPO as competitive alternatives to buying software and hardware Our competitors that offer business applications and middleware products may influence a customers purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products add new functionality acquire competitive products reduce prices or form strategic alliances with other companies We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense Our hardware systems business competes with among others i systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating systems and those of our competitors ii microprocessorchip manufacturers and iii providers of storage products Our hardware systems business causes us to compete with companies who historically have been partners Some of these competitors may have more experience than we do in managing a hardware business A large portion of our hardware products are based on our SPARC microprocessor and Oracle Solaris operating system platform which has a smaller installed base than certain of our competitors platforms and which may make it difficult for us to win new customers that have already made significant investments in our competitors platforms Certain of these competitors also compete very aggressively on price A loss in our competitive position could result in lower revenues or profitability which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardware systems business Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the United States Our international operations include software and hardware systems development manufacturing assembly sales customer support consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers Compliance with international and US laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions These laws and regulations include US laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries could delay or prevent potential 21 Table of Contents acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results Compliance with these laws requires a significant amount of management attention and effort which may divert managements attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded Where circumstances warrant we provide information and report our findings to government authorities but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries including those related to general economic conditions in each country or region fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to our operating results difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries such as Venezuela that have led to a devaluation of our net assets in particular our cash assets in that countrys currency regulatory changes including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries political unrest terrorism and the potential for other hostilities including those in Ukraine natural disasters longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable overlapping tax regimes our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates public health risks particularly in areas in which we have significant operations and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware systems products segment and the sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited OFSS a publicly traded Indian software company focused on the banking industry we are faced with several additional risks including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if OFSS were a wholly owned subsidiary Acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction In recent years we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies products services and technologies An active acquisition program is an important element of our overall corporate strategy and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include our ongoing business may be disrupted and our managements attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected or we may overpay for or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill 22 Table of Contents we may have difficulties i managing an acquired companys technologies or lines of business ii entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions or iii retaining key personnel from the acquired companies our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition including claims from government agencies terminated employees current or former customers former stockholders or other third parties preexisting contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired companys practices and intellectual property claims or disputes we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes due a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons including if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew software or hardware support contracts or cloudbased subscription contracts if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies products services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of business and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards architecture controls procedures and policies we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered priced and supported differently which could cause customer confusion and delays we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products or services in general and administrative functions that support new business models or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from or may otherwise have certain limitations restrictions penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis if at all which could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash including stock repurchases dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness we may significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease and we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to US generally accepted accounting principles including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition 23 Table of Contents The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions We may experience foreign currency gains and losses We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the US Dollar Changes in the value of major foreign currencies particularly the Euro Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the US Dollar can significantly affect our assets revenues and operating results Generally our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens Generally our assets that we report are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a significant portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits among other assets are held in foreign currencies During fiscal 2014 and 2013 we incurred foreign currency losses associated with our Venezuelan subsidiary due to it being designated as operating in a highly inflationary economy and due to the subsequent devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar relative to the US Dollar We may incur similar foreign currency losses for countries that are dealing with similar risks of high inflation such as in certain Latin American and other emerging market countries where we do business In addition we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term which are charged against earnings in the period incurred We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with these foreign currency exposures that we may suspend from time to time As a part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses A large portion of our consolidated operations are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts For example we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows Our periodic workforce restructurings including reorganizations of our sales force can be disruptive We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily in response to management changes product changes performance issues acquisitions and other internal and external considerations In the past these types of sales force restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs increased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the sales teams adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities In addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings or do so within the expected timeframe These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected Our hardware systems revenues and profitability could decline if we do not manage the risks associated with our hardware systems business Our hardware systems business may adversely affect our overall profitability if we do not effectively manage the associated risks We may not achieve our estimated revenue profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware systems business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors including as we develop and introduce new versions or next generations of our hardware systems products customers may defer or delay purchases of existing hardware systems products and wait for these new releases all of which could adversely affect our hardware systems revenues in the short term 24 Table of Contents our hardware systems business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues and thus has been less profitable than our software and cloud business our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle SuperCluster products which are in the relatively early stages of adoption by our customers and our deemphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware systems products that historically constituted a larger portion of our hardware systems revenues we face a greater risk of potential writedowns and impairments of inventory higher warranty expenses than in our software and cloud and services businesses higher amortization from intangible assets and potential impairment of intangible assets and goodwill associated with our hardware systems business Any of these items could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results we may not be able to increase sales of hardware systems support contracts or such increase may take longer than we anticipate which could result in lower revenues and profitability or slower than expected growth of such revenues and profitability and we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operating margins than our own that leverage different platforms or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating or that utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquired products within our own manufacturing operations Our hardware systems offerings are complex products and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity the results of our hardware systems business will suffer Designing developing manufacturing and introducing new hardware systems products are complicated processes The development process for our hardware systems products is uncertain and requires a high level of innovation After the development phase we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware systems products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do so in a cost effective manner Our buildtoorder manufacturing model in which our hardware systems products generally are not built until after customers place orders may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware systems products to customers in a timely manner These delays could cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors We must also manage new hardware product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchases of existing hardware systems products in anticipation of new hardware systems product releases It is also possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws which could delay or prevent the production of the components for which we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardware products to be returned recalled or rejected resulting in lost revenues increases in warranty costs or costs related to remediation efforts damage to our reputation penalties and litigation We depend on suppliers to design develop manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary components for our hardware products and there are some components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price quality technology availability or other business constraints As a result our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by natural disasters political unrest or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience significant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary parts or components from a particular vendor If we had to find a new supplier for these parts and components hardware systems product shipments could be delayed which would adversely affect our hardware systems revenues We could also experience fluctuations in component prices which if unanticipated could negatively impact our hardware systems business cost structure These factors may make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a timely fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware products Therefore we may experience component inventory shortages which may result in production delays or customers choosing to purchase fewer hardware products from us or systems products from our competitors We negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient components for our hardware products to meet anticipated 25 Table of Contents customer demand We must also manage our levels of older component inventories used in our hardware products to minimize inventory writeoffs or writedowns If we have excess inventory it may be necessary to writedown the inventory which would adversely affect our operating results If one or more of the risks described above occurs our hardware systems business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected We are susceptible to third party manufacturing and logistics delays which could result in the loss of sales and customers We outsource the manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the United States Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs product supply and delivery delays as well as the political and economic uncertainties and natural disasters of the international locations where certain of these third party manufacturers have facilities and operations Any manufacturing disruption or logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for these hardware systems products for extended periods of time If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively or if these third parties experience delays disruptions capacity constraints regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our hardware systems products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware systems business could be harmed We have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third party manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these third party manufacturers build our hardware systems products We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturing partners and locations If these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timely or cost effective manner if at all If we are required to change third party manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled hardware systems products deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware systems products expenses all of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business These challenges and risks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware products and related supply chain operations In some cases we may be dependent at least initially on these acquired companies supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these challenges and risks Our mixed direct and indirect sales model for our hardware systems products may not succeed and could result in lower hardware revenues or profits Disruptions to our software indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results Although we sell our hardware systems products through indirect channels including independent distributors and value added resellers we have enhanced our direct sales coverage for our hardware products and intend that our direct sales force will sell a larger portion of our hardware products in the future than they do now These direct sales efforts however may not be successful Our relationships with some of our channel partners may deteriorate because we have reduced our reliance on some of these partners for sales of our hardware products and have modified our approach and timing to the manufacturing of our products which could result in reduced demand from the channel partners or certain customer segments serviced by these channel partners Some hardware revenues from channel partners may not be replaced by revenues generated from our own sales personnel or may not be replaced as quickly as we expect In addition our sales personnel may not be able to achieve our sales forecasts for our hardware business If we experience any of these risks our hardware revenues and profits may decline Our software indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers system integratorsimplementers consultants education providers internet service providers network integrators and independent software vendors Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our software marketing and sales efforts Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants products and 26 Table of Contents services were to decrease There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants If we are not successful we may lose sales opportunities customers and revenues We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights We rely on copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights Despite our efforts these protections may be limited Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property Any patents owned by us may be invalidated circumvented or challenged Any of our pending or future patent applications whether or not being currently challenged may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek if at all In addition the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the United States If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive Third parties have claimed and in the future may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights andor breach of license agreement provisions We periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse We expect the number of such claims will increase as we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows the use and support of third party code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the industry the volume of issued patents continues to increase and the proliferation of nonpracticing entities asserting intellectual property infringement claims increases Responding to any such claim regardless of its validity could be time consuming costly and result in litigation divert managements time and attention from developing our business require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products require us to release source code to third parties possibly under open source license terms require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers or otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees We rely on the continued service of our senior management including our Chief Executive Officer and founder members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees In the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel In addition acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or at Oracle We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel With rare exceptions we do not have longterm employment or noncompetition agreements with our employees Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations 27 Table of Contents We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs When we make adjustments to our workforce we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program Our compensation program includes stock options which are an important tool in attracting and retaining employees in our industry If our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees In addition because we expense all stockbased compensation we may in the future change our stockbased and other compensation practices Some of the changes we consider from time to time include a reduction in the number of employees granted stock options a reduction in the number of stock options granted per employee and a change to alternative forms of stockbased compensation all of which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and also impact the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record Any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel Our sales to government clients subject us to business volatility and risks including government budgeting cycles and appropriations early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties We derive revenues from contracts with the US government state and local governments and foreign governments and their respective agencies which may terminate most of these contracts at any time without cause There is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending Further our US federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the US Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts Similarly our contracts at the state and local levels in the US and our contracts with foreign governments and their agencies are generally subject to government funding authorizations Additionally government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact pricing in both our onpremise enterprise software business and our cloud business as well as overall demand for our onpremise software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability Our software license updates and product support fees and hardware systems support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net new software licenses fees and net new hardware systems products fees respectively Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our product or support pricing Any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations These practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all Developing software cloud and hardware offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired Accelerated product and service introductions and short software and hardware life cycles 28 Table of Contents require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position However we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all Business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results A significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services including some of our cloud offerings A major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected Adverse litigation results could affect our business We are subject to various legal proceedings Litigation can be lengthy expensive and disruptive to our operations and can divert our managements attention away from the running of our business The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business operating results or financial condition Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities As a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities We are regularly under audit by tax authorities and those authorities often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate For example the United States many countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business are actively considering changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals which if enacted could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate Further in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the US Internal Revenue Service IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future We have negotiated certain unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS and certain selected bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the relevant tax authorities from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements However these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing In addition our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States that have lower statutory tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates We are also subject to nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome based taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome based tax liabilities Our acquisition activities have increased our nonincome based tax exposures particularly with our entry into the hardware systems business which increased the volume and complexity of laws and regulations that we are subject to and with which we must comply Although we believe that our income and nonincome based tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to ASC 805 Business Combinations we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their 29 Table of Contents acquisition date fair values and in each case separately from goodwill Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred which is also generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain After we complete an acquisition the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention redeployment or relocation expenses impairment of goodwill or intangible assets in particular within our hardware systems products or consulting reporting units for which the amounts of goodwill and intangible assets that we have recorded increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future and for which we have experienced revenues andor margin declines as compared to prior years amortization of intangible assets acquired a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities both income tax and nonincome tax related after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period generally up to one year from the acquisition date whichever comes first charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative premerger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities for a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated charges to eliminate certain duplicative premerger activities and charges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition and charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness As of May 31 2014 we had an aggregate of 242 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between the remainder of calendar 2014 and calendar 2040 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt Furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase Should we incur future increases in interest expense our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our US federal income tax could be limited which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate In addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on outstanding or future debt These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs Some of our cloud and hardware systems operations are subject to state federal and international laws governing protection of the environment proper handling and disposal of materials 30 Table of Contents used for these offerings human health and safety and regulating the use of certain chemical substances We endeavor to comply with these environmental and other laws yet compliance with such laws could increase our product design development procurement manufacturing delivery and administration costs limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete noncompliant inventory change our sales activities or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware systems businesses Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability including fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware systems businesses The US Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain conflict minerals commonly referred to as tantalum tin tungsten and gold in their products Our supply chain is multitiered global and highly complex As a provider of hardware systems end products we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain Accordingly our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited Our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict mineral disclosure requirements A significant portion of our hardware systems revenues come from international sales Environmental legislation within the European Union EU including the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances RoHS and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive WEEE Directive as well as Chinas regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware systems revenues from EU countries and China as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements In addition similar environmental legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions the cumulative impact of which could be significant Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes could also affect our stock price Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect our stock price Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources which could adversely affect our business Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties Our properties consist of owned and leased office facilities for sales support research and development consulting manufacturing and administrative personnel Our headquarters facility consists of approximately 20 million square feet in Redwood City California substantially all of which we own We lease our principal internal manufacturing facility for our hardware systems products in Hillsboro Oregon We also own or lease other office facilities for current use consisting of approximately 241 million square feet in various other locations in the United States and abroad We believe our facilities are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business Approximately 29 million square feet or 11 of total owned and leased space is sublet or is being actively marketed for sublease or disposition Item 3 Legal Proceedings The material set forth

dividend of 012 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 30 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 9 2014 We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis however future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors For equity compensation plan information please refer to Item 12 in Part III of this Annual Report Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock On June 20 2013 we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional 120 billion Approximately 43 billion remained available for stock repurchases as of May 31 2014 pursuant to our stock repurchase program Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt our stock price and economic and market conditions Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b51 plan Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated

data as of and for the last five fiscal years This selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 of this Annual Report Over the last five fiscal years we have acquired a number of companies including Sun Microsystems Inc in fiscal 2010 among others The results of our acquired companies have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition and have contributed to our growth in revenues income earnings per share and total assets As of and for the Year Ended May

14655 Total working capital sequentially increased in most periods primarily due to the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during these periods and the issuances of longterm senior notes of 20 billion and 30 billion in fiscal 2014 50 billion in fiscal 2013 and 325 billion in fiscal 2011 These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions repurchases of common stock and dividend payments made in all periods presented and repayments of certain of our senior notes in fiscal 2013 2011 and 2010 Our notes payable and other borrowings which represented the summation of our notes payable current and other current borrowings and notes payable and other noncurrent borrowings as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above increased between fiscal 2010 and 2014 due to the issuances of longterm senior notes of 20 billion and 30 billion in fiscal 2014 and 50 billion in fiscal 2013 17 billion and 115 billion of shortterm borrowings made pursuant to our revolving credit agreements in fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively and 325 billion of longterm senior notes in fiscal 2011 See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our notes payable and other borrowings 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition Business Overview We are the worlds largest provider of enterprise software and a leading provider of computer hardware products and services that are engineered to work together in the cloud and in the data center Our offerings include Oracle database and middleware software application software cloud infrastructure hardware systemsincluding computer server storage and networking productsand related services We develop and maintain our products and services to be enterprisegrade reliable secure and interoperable while offering customers a choice in deployment models that best meet their information technology IT needs

customers cloud IT environments An important element of our corporate strategy is to deliver reliable secure and scalable products and services that are built upon industry standards and are engineered to work both together or independently regardless of the deployment model selected We believe that our investments in and continued innovation with respect to our software and cloud hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our longterm strategic plans In fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 we invested 52 billion 49 billion and 45 billion respectively in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services We have expanded our enterprisegrade cloud computing offerings through our continued investments in research and development and through targeted acquisitions in order to broaden our Oracle Cloud offerings For example our Oracle Cloud SoftwareasaService offerings including our sales marketing customer service financials project management human capital and talent management cloud solutions among others enable us to provide IT functionality that customers can use to manage critical business functions in a rapidly deployable delivery model with lower upfront customer investment Certain of our enterprisegrade cloud computing offerings include infrastructure based upon our Oracle Engineered Systems including our Oracle Exadata Database Machine Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle SuperCluster products among others We designed our Oracle Engineered Systems to combine certain of our hardware and software offerings to increase computing performance relative to our competitors products creating cost efficiencies time savings and operational cost advantages for our customers Our Oracle Engineered Systems provide the core infrastructure for our own onpremise IT data centers and those of our customers and for cloud IT environments including our own Oracle Cloud services our partners cloud services and our customers cloud environments We also continue to demonstrate our commitment to customer choice through ongoing enhancements to our Oracle EBusiness Suite Siebel PeopleSoft and JD Edwards application software products and services amongst others We believe that an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy as it enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers expands our customer base provides greater scale to accelerate innovation grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value In recent years we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies products services and technologies that add to are complementary to or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings We expect to continue to acquire companies products services and technologies to further our corporate strategy 35 Table of Contents We are organized into three businessessoftware and cloud hardware systems and serviceswhich are further divided into certain operating segments Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges Although we report our actual results in US Dollars we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than US Dollars Therefore we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations Our cloud infrastructureasaservice segment was established during our fiscal quarter ended May 31 2014 Our fiscal 2014 results and historical results for fiscal 2013 and 2012 reflect this new segment structure and will continue prospectively in our future filings See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our operating segments An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows Software and Cloud Business Our software and cloud business which represented 76 75 and 72 of our total revenues in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively is comprised of three operating segments 1 new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions 2 cloud infrastructureasaservice and 3 software license updates and product support On a constant currency basis we expect that our software and cloud business total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and subscription offerings our software license updates and product support offerings including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts and our acquisitions which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development New Software Licenses and Cloud Software Subscriptions We license our database and middleware as well as our application software and provide access to a broad range of our software through Oracle Cloud SoftwareasaService SaaS and Oracle Cloud PlatformasaService PaaS offerings SaaS and PaaS collectively are referred to as cloud software subscriptions Our software offerings are substantially built on a standardsbased integrated architecture that is designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructure Our software offerings are substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or onpremise IT environments and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris Oracle Linux Microsoft Windows and third party UNIX products among others Our customers include businesses of many sizes government agencies educational institutions and resellers We market and sell our software products and services to these customers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best fit their needs We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them The growth in our new software licenses and our SaaS and PaaS revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints the competitive position of our software offerings our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations The substantial majority of our new software licenses transactions are characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues New software licenses and cloud software subscriptions revenues represented 28 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 27 in fiscal 2012 Our cloud software subscriptions contracts which consist of SaaS and PaaS arrangements are generally one to three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal Our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segments margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the shortterm However our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segments margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud software subscriptions obligations that we assumed in our business combinations described further below and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired For certain of our acquired businesses we recorded adjustments to reduce the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates As a result as required by business combination accounting rules we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to acquired contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of 17 million 45 million 36 Table of Contents and 22 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively To the extent underlying cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition we will recognize the revenues for the full values of these contracts over their respective contractual periods Cloud InfrastructureasaService Our cloud infrastructureasaservice offerings IaaS which represented 1 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 2 in fiscal 2012 provide deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including virtual machine instances that are subscriptionbased and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage Oracle Engineered Systems hardware and related support that are deployed in our customers data centers for a monthly fee and comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT infrastructure for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities select partner data centers or physically onpremise at customer facilities Software License Updates and Product Support Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period as well as technical support assistance Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration and substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors 1 the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts 2 the amount of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and 3 the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired Software license updates and product support revenues which represented 47 46 and 43 of our total revenues in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively is our highest margin business unit Our software support margins during fiscal 2014 were 89 and accounted for 77 of our total margins over the same period Our software license updates and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations described further below and by amortization of intangible assets However over the longer term we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons substantially all of our customers including customers from acquired companies renew their software support contracts when eligible for renewal substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses resulting in a further increase in our software support contract base Even if new software licenses revenues growth was flat software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts which add to our software support contract base and our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported We recorded adjustments to reduce software support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates As a result as required by business combination accounting rules we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of 3 million 14 million and 48 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively To the extent underlying software support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the software support contracts over the respective support periods the majority of which are one year Hardware Systems Business Our hardware systems business is comprised of two operating segments 1 hardware systems products and 2 hardware systems support Our hardware business represented 14 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 17 in fiscal 2012 We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a 37 Table of Contents percentage of revenues than our software and cloud business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services including direct materials and labor costs We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services Hardware Systems Products We provide a broad selection of hardware systems and related services including servers storage networking virtualization software operating systems and management software to support diverse IT environments including cloud computing environments We engineer our hardware systems with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and onpremise IT infrastructures Our hardware products support many of the worlds largest cloud infrastructures including the Oracle Cloud Our hardware products and services are designed to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or nonOracle hardware or software components This flexible and open approach provides Oracles customers with a broad range of choices in deploying hardware systems which we believe is a priority for our customers Our hardware products and services also help to meet customers demands to manage growing amounts of data and business requirements to meet increasing compliance and regulatory demands and to reduce energy space and operational costs We have also engineered our hardware systems products to create performance and operational cost advantages for customers when our hardware and software products are combined as Oracle Engineered Systems We offer a wide range of server systems using our SPARC microprocessor Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed to be differentiated by their reliability security and scalability Our midsize and large servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications for customers having more computationally intensive needs and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the Oracle SuperCluster one of our Oracle Engineered Systems We also offer enterprise x86 servers These x86 servers are based on microprocessor platforms from Intel Corporation and are compatible with Oracle Solaris Oracle Linux Microsoft Windows and other operating systems Our x86 servers are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including Oracle Exadata Database Machine Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud Oracle Exalytics InMemory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance Our storage products are designed to securely manage protect archive and restore customers mission critical data assets and consist of tape disk flash and hardwarerelated software including file systems software backup and archive software and storage management software and networking for mainframe and open systems environments Our networking and data center fabric products including Oracle Virtual Networking and Oracle InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance reduce cost and complexity and simplify storage and server connectivity We also offer hardware and software products and services for communications networks including network signaling policy control and subscriber data management solutions and session border control technology amongst others The majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and value added resellers To produce our hardware products we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement assembly testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage systems For all other manufacturing we generally rely on third party manufacturing partners to produce our hardware related components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly testing and quality control processes for these components and products We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a buildtoorder manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders 38 Table of Contents Our hardware systems products revenues cost of hardware systems products and hardware systems operating margins that we report are affected by our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware systems products the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations In addition our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets Our quarterly hardware systems products revenues are difficult to predict The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues expenses and operating margins that we report Hardware Systems Support Our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our server storage and networking products such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products and can include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Typically our hardware systems support contract arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration We continue to evolve hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware systems products Our hardware systems support revenues that we report are influenced by a number of factors including the volume of purchases of hardware products the mix of hardware products purchased whether customers decide to purchase hardware systems support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and our acquisitions Substantially all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available Our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting including fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed and by the amortization of intangible assets As required by business combination accounting rules we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisitions to their estimated fair values These amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of 11 million 14 million and 30 million for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively To the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the respective support periods Services Business Our services business which represented 10 of our total revenues in fiscal 2014 and 11 in each of fiscal 2013 and 2012 is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments Our services business has lower margins than our software and cloud and hardware businesses Our services revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions general economic conditions governmental budgetary constraints personnel reductions in our customers IT departments tighter controls over discretionary spending and the growth in our software and hardware systems products revenues Our services business offerings include consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our products including IT strategy alignment enterprise architecture planning and design initial product implementation and integration and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades We utilize a global blended delivery model to optimize value for our customers and partners consisting of onpremise consultants from local geographies industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers advanced customer support services which are provided onpremise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their Oracle products and services and education services for Oracle products and services including training and certification programs that are offered to customers partners and employees through a variety of formats including instructorled classes at our education centers live virtual training selfpaced online training private events and custom training 39 Table of Contents Acquisitions An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy In recent years we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies products services and technologies including Responsys Inc Responsys and Tekelec Global Inc Tekelec in fiscal 2014 and Acme Packet Inc Acme Packet in fiscal 2013 amongst others On June 22 2014 we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger Merger Agreement with MICROS Systems Inc MICROS a provider of integrated software hardware and services solutions to the hospitality and retail industries Pursuant to the Merger Agreement we will commence a tender offer for the outstanding shares and shares generally representing vested equity incentive awards of MICROS collectively MICROS Shares MICROS shareholders will have the right to tender their MICROS Shares to Oracle in exchange for 6800 per share in cash upon consummation of the tender offer The tender offer will commence no later than ten business days from June 22 2014 After completion of the tender offer and subject to certain limited conditions MICROS will merge with and into a whollyowned subsidiary of Oracle In addition unvested equity awards to acquire MICROS common stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger will generally be converted into equity awards denominated in shares of our common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement The estimated total purchase price for MICROS is approximately 53 billion This transaction is conditioned upon i at least a majority of the MICROS Shares being validly tendered to Oracle ii regulatory clearance under the HartScottRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 iii the applicable merger control laws of the European Commission and other jurisdictions and iv certain other customary closing conditions We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers expands our customer base provides greater scale to accelerate innovation grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value We expect to continue to acquire companies products services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our pending and recent acquisitions We believe we can fund our pending and future acquisitions with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings operating margin cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC GAAP as set forth within the ASC requires us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our financial statements will be affected The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following Revenue Recognition Business Combinations Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments Accounting for Income Taxes Legal and Other Contingencies StockBased Compensation 40 Table of Contents In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include 1 software and cloud revenues including new software licenses revenues earned from granting licenses to use our software products cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues generated from fees for granting customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure standardsbased cloud computing environment cloud IaaS revenues generated from fees for deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure generally on a subscription basis and software license updates and product support revenues 2 hardware systems revenues which include the sale of hardware systems products including computer servers storage products networking and data center fabric products and hardware systems support revenues and 3 services which includes software and hardware related services including consulting advanced customer support and education revenues Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services Software Elements New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database middleware and application software and exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates which are included in software license updates and product support revenues The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985605 SoftwareRevenue Recognition We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize new software licenses revenues when 1 we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software 2 we deliver the products 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties and 4 collection is probable Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions However if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy for example in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are shortterm in nature we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example acceptance provisions that are longterm in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts which are entered into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement typically one year Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement Arrangements Software Products and Software Related Services Software Arrangements We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as software related multipleelement arrangements Such software related multipleelement arrangements include the sale of our software products software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements For those software related multipleelement arrangements we have applied the residual method to 41 Table of Contents determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985605 Under the residual method if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multipleelement arrangement such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multipleelement arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence VSOEdescribed further below with any remaining amount allocated to the software license Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS Offerings Hardware Systems Products Hardware Systems Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Elements Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables including cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware systems products and hardware systems related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 60525 Revenue Recognition MultipleElement Arrangements and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues hardware systems products revenues and hardware related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met When applicable we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example acceptance provisions that are longterm in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloudbased IT environment that we manage and offer to customers on a subscription basis Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Our cloud IaaS offerings provide deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT infrastructure for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities select partner data centers or physically onpremise at customer facilities generally for a termbased fee and virtual machine instances that are subscriptionbased and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage Revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Our cloud IaaS offerings also include our Oracle Engineered Systems hardware and related support that are deployed onpremise in our customers data centers for a monthly fee and provide for the purchase of additional capacity on demand Our revenue recognition policy for these onpremise offerings is in accordance with ASC 605 and ASC 840 Leases and substantially all of these offerings are accounted for as operating leases as our contracts are structured so that the term of the arrangement is less than 75 of the economic life of the equipment and the present value of the minimum fixed payments are less than 90 of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the arrangement Our evaluation of useful life is based on our historical product development cycles and our historical customer hardware upgrade cycles Capacity on demand is a contingent payment and is therefore excluded from our assessment of the net present value of fixed payments Revenue for capacity on demand is recognized in the period our customers access additional capacity provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers storage and networking products including the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products and can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees Hardware systems support contracts are entered 42 Table of Contents into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements which are typically one year Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsCloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS Offerings Hardware Systems Products Hardware Systems Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Arrangements We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements Each element within a nonsoftware multipleelement arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer Further our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period or in the case of our cloud offerings generally over the estimated customer relationship period For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements For our nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy VSOE if available third party evidence TPE if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available a description as to how we determine VSOE TPE and ESP is provided below If a tangible hardware systems product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the products essential functionality and if so the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions When possible we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support based on the renewal rates offered to customers TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including but not limited to pricing practices including discounting margin objectives competition contractually stated prices the geographies in which we offer our products and services the type of customer ie distributor value added reseller government agency and direct end user among others and the stage of the product lifecycle The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management taking into consideration our pricing model and gotomarket strategy As our or our competitors pricing and gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE TPE and ESP As a result our future revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices 43 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement Arrangements Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multipleelement arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including new software licenses software license updates and product support cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware systems products hardware systems support consulting advanced customer support services and education In such arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985605 and our policies as described above After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985605 The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of services from other vendors timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed When total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and nonsoftware products and services We offer these advanced support services both onpremise and remote to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services Depending upon the nature of the arrangement revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period which is generally one year or less Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructorled mediabased and internetbased training in the use of our software and hardware products Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions then new software licenses revenues andor hardware systems products revenues including the costs of hardware systems products are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software and cloud hardware systems and services arrangements 1 that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees 2 where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by Oracle 44 Table of Contents 3 where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted or 4 where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions when such provisions are required by law to determine the probability of possible cancellation We consider multiple factors including the history with the customer in similar transactions the essential use of the software or hardware systems products and the planning budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met If such a determination cannot be made revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met Our standard payment terms are net 30 days However payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include shortterm payment terms we have a standard practice of providing longterm financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division Since fiscal 1989 when our financing division was formed we have established a history of collection without concessions on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery net of any payment discounts from financing transactions We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a nonrecourse basis to third party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows We account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables In addition we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products These leasing companies in turn lease our products to endusers The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the enduser and we recognize revenue upon delivery if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies Concurrent Transactions Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a threemonth time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure When we acquire goods or services from a customer we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction at terms we consider to be at arms length and settle the purchase in cash We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations in the accounting for our acquisitions It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets 45 Table of Contents acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets contractual obligations assumed restructuring liabilities preacquisition contingencies and contingent consideration where applicable Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts hardware systems product sales support agreements consulting contracts other customer contracts acquired developed technologies and patents expected costs to develop the inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed the acquired companys brand and competitive position as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio and discount rates Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results We estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS and PaaS collectively cloud software subscriptions software license updates and product support and hardware systems support obligations assumed The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost buildup approach The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition As a result we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts in the amounts of 17 million 45 million and 22 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively We did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of 3 million 14 million and 48 million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively In addition we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of 11 million 14 million and 30 million for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively Historically substantially all of our customers including customers from acquired companies renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS and hardware systems support contracts To the extent cloud SaaS and PaaS software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the contracts over the contracts periods which are generally one year in duration In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management but may be refined in subsequent periods 46 Table of Contents We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities assumptions are applied regarding estimated sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made For a given acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a preacquisition contingency nonincome tax related by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if i it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and ii the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 IntangiblesGoodwill and Other According to ASC 350 we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two step impairment test Based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the two step impairment test will be performed In the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain Actual future results may differ from those estimates In addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed on March 1 2014 did not result in a goodwill impairment charge nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2013 or 2012 Our consulting and hardware systems products reporting units have experienced revenues and operating margin declines in fiscal 2014 as compared to prior years As a result our consulting and hardware systems products reporting units may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for these reporting units differ from our projections 47 Table of Contents We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value If the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective They can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2014 2013 or 2012 Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision In the ordinary course of a global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no US taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations Based on these assumptions we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide US federal taxes on these amounts Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located We consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known which can materially impact our effective tax rate The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly 48 Table of Contents judgmental A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740 Income Taxes which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit judicial rulings and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties In addition as a part of our accounting for business combinations intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure however deferred taxes have been recorded for nondeductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable Because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made As additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position StockBased Compensation We account for sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options restricted stockbased awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with ASC 718 CompensationStock Compensation which requires that sharebased payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values We recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the service period of the award which is generally four years We are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stockbased compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures based upon historical experience actual forfeitures in the future may differ To the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates we record a trueup for the difference in the period that the awards vest and such trueups could materially affect our operating results Additionally we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate 49 Table of Contents We estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a BlackScholesMerton valuation model The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options The riskfree interest rate assumption we use is based upon US treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards We use the implied volatility of publicly traded options in our stock in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options we have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification Our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our Board of Directors The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock awards and related stockbased compensation expense that we record to vary We record deferred tax assets for stockbased compensation awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction Because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stockbased compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense In addition differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paidin capital If the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits If the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense To the extent we change the terms of our employee stockbased compensation programs experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of publicly traded options in our stock refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements among other potential impacts the stockbased compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 is impacted by our acquisitions primarily our acquisitions of Responsys in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 Tekelec in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and Acme Packet in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 is impacted by our acquisitions primarily our acquisitions of Acme Packet in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 Taleo Corporation Taleo in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and RightNow Technologies Inc RightNow during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 we may qualitatively disclose the impacts of our acquired products for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date to the growth in our new software licenses revenues cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues software license updates and product support revenues hardware systems products revenues and hardware systems support revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations When material we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products The contributions of our acquisitions to our other businesses and operating segments revenues and to the expense contributions for substantially all of our businesses and operating segments in each of the respective period comparisons are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations andor were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented 50 Table of Contents We caution readers that while pre and postacquisition comparisons as well as any quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies including our sales force integration efforts We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated the relative mix of products sold would have been different and although substantially all of our customers including customers from acquired companies renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware systems support contracts the amounts shown as cloud softwareasaservice and platformasaservice deferred revenues software license updates and product support deferred revenues and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges presented below are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses As a result total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the US Dollar against major international currencies In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure To present this information current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US Dollars are converted into US Dollars at constant exchange rates ie the rates in effect on May 31 2013 which was the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods For example if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 10 million Euros from products sold on May 31 2014 and 2013 our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of 136 million in fiscal 2014 using 136 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period and 129 million in fiscal 2013 using 129 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period The constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal 2014 results using the fiscal 2013 exchange rate and indicate in this example no change in revenues during the period In each of the tables below we present the percent change based on actual unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency 51 Table of

fiscal 2014 by 4 percentage points due to increases in our software and cloud business revenues and our hardware business revenues partially offset by a decrease in our services business revenues The constant currency growth in our software and cloud business was substantially attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues and to a lesser extent our cloud softwareasaservice SaaS and platformasaservice PaaS revenues due to incremental revenues from our acquisitions The constant currency revenues growth in our hardware business was due to an increase in our hardware systems support revenues due substantially to incremental revenues from our acquisitions and due to increases in our hardware revenues attributable to our Oracle Engineered Systems partially offset by revenue decreases attributable to reductions in the sales volumes of certain of our legacy hardware product lines including lower margin products On a constant currency basis the Americas contributed 61 EMEA contributed 30 and Asia Pacific contributed 9 to our total revenues growth during fiscal 2014 Total constant currency operating expenses increased during fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting from increased headcount higher salesbased variable compensation expenses due to revenues growth and an increase in cloud SaaS and PaaS costs resulting from additional expenses incurred to support the increases in our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues These expense increases in fiscal 2014 were partially offset by lower constant currency expenses from our hardware systems support and services segments due to decreased headcount lower restructuring expenses and lower intangible assets amortization In fiscal 2013 we recognized a 387 million acquisition related benefit see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information and a 306 million benefit relating to certain litigation see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information both of which decreased our acquisition related and other expenses during this period Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations our operating margin increased during fiscal 2014 due to our revenues growth while our operating margin as a percentage of revenues was flat 52 Table of Contents Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations our total revenues increased in fiscal 2013 due to an increase in our software and cloud business revenues This constant currency increase was partially offset by reductions in our hardware systems and services business revenues On a constant currency basis the Americas region contributed 77 and the Asia Pacific region contributed 23 to our growth in total revenues during fiscal 2013 Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations total operating expenses decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to a 387 million acquisition related benefit and a 306 million benefit related to certain litigation both as noted above lower hardware systems products costs associated with lower hardware systems products revenues and certain other operating expense decreases in most of our other lines of business primarily due to lower variable compensation expenses lower external contractor expenses and lower amortization of intangible assets In constant currency these total expense decreases during fiscal 2013 were partially offset by higher salary and benefit expenses due primarily to additional sales and marketing and research and development headcount added during fiscal 2013 Excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations our total operating margin and our total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during fiscal 2013 due to the increase in our total revenues and the decrease in our total operating expenses Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future You should review the introduction under Impact of Acquisitions above for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre and postacquisition information Our operating results included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions as well as

support and hardware systems support obligations assumed Due to our application of business combination accounting rules we did not recognize cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of 17 million 45 million and 22 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively We also did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to software support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of 3 million 14 million and 48 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively In addition we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amounts of 11 million 14 million and 30 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively Approximately 3 million of estimated cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues related to contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2015 that would have otherwise been recognized as revenues by the acquired businesses as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules Approximately 2 million of estimated hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts assumed will not be recognized during fiscal 2015 that would have otherwise been recognized by certain acquired companies as independent entities due to the application of the aforementioned business combination accounting rules To the extent customers renew these contracts with us we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective contracts renewal periods 53 Table of Contents Represents the amortization of intangible assets substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions As of May 31

and other expenses resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stockbased awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stockbased awards The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented Income tax effects for fiscal 2014 and 2013 were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in effective tax rates of 225 and 230 respectively instead of 201 and 214 respectively which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statement of operations primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets Income tax effects for fiscal 2012 were calculated reflecting an effective tax rate of 240 instead of 230 which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations due to the disproportionate rate impact of certain discrete items income tax effects related to our acquired tax exposures and differences in jurisdictional tax rates and related tax benefits attributable to our restructuring expenses in the period Software and Cloud Business

Venezuelan subsidiary The Venezuelan economy has been determined to be highly inflationary in accordance with ASC 830 Foreign Currency Matters As a result we report all net monetary assets related to our Venezuelan subsidiary in US Dollars with the associated impacts of periodic changes of Bolivar Fuerte VEF to US Dollar exchange rates in our statements of operations for each respective reporting period During fiscal 2014 the Venezuelan government issued new exchange agreements that allowed for certain foreign currency transactions which previously were subject to Venezuelas official Bolivar Fuerte VEF to US Dollar exchange rate the Official Rate to be subject to conversion at rates established at the Venezuelan governments auctionbased exchange rate programs the Complementary System for Foreign Currency Administration SICAD rates These SICAD rates were lower than the Official Rate that we had used historically to report the VEF based transactions and net monetary assets of our 65 Table of Contents Venezuelan subsidiary To determine which of the various VEF rates to use during fiscal 2014 we evaluated our individual facts and circumstances taking into consideration our legal ability to convert VEF at or to settle VEF based transactions using the SICAD rates amongst other factors We concluded that using the SICAD rates was the most appropriate for our reporting of our Venezuelan subsidiarys VEF based transactions and net monetary assets in US Dollars which resulted in the 213 million of fiscal 2014 remeasurement losses referenced above Future devaluations of the Venezuelan currency are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international we could experience additional foreign currency volatility and incur additional remeasurement losses in the future the amounts and timing of which are unknown Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 On a constant currency basis our nonoperating income net decreased in fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in foreign currency transaction losses net that included a foreign currency loss relating to our Venezuelan subsidiarys operations During our third quarter of fiscal 2013 the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and we recognized a 64 million foreign currency loss as a result of the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary This decrease in nonoperating income net was partially offset by an increase in other income net during fiscal 2013 which was primarily due to gains from our marketable securities that we designated as trading that were held to support our deferred compensation plan obligations Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the US federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations state taxes the US research and development tax credit and the US domestic production activity deduction Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation Year Ended May 31 Percent Change Percent Change Dollars in millions 2014 Actual Constant 2013 Actual Constant 2012 Provision

Compared to Fiscal 2012 Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2013 decreased slightly due to acquisition related items the retroactive extension of the US research and development credit offset by

billion and 30 billion of longterm senior notes in July 2013 the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2014 and to a lesser extent cash proceeds from stock option exercises These working capital increases were partially offset by the reclassification of 15 billion of senior notes due July 2014 from longterm to current cash used for repurchases of our common stock we used 98 billion of cash for common stock repurchases during fiscal 2014 cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for acquisitions all of which occurred during fiscal 2014 Our working capital 66 Table of Contents may be impacted by some of the aforementioned factors in future periods the amounts and timing of which are variable The increase in working capital as of May 31 2013 in comparison to May 31 2012 was primarily due to our issuance of 50 billion of senior notes in October 2012 the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2013 and to a lesser extent cash proceeds from stock option exercises This increase was partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock we used 110 billion of cash for common stock repurchases during fiscal 2013 cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for acquisitions Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks Tier1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less Marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks Tier1 commercial paper corporate notes and certain other securities The increase in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31 2014 in comparison to May 31 2013 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities our issuance of 20 billion and 30 billion of senior notes in July 2013 and to a lesser extent cash proceeds from stock option exercises These increases were partially offset by 98 billion of repurchases of our common stock 35 billion of net cash paid for acquisitions and 22 billion used for the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities included 352 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31 2014 We consider 324 billion of our undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States These undistributed earnings would be subject to US income tax if repatriated to the United States Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately 100 billion as of May 31 2014 should the amounts be repatriated to the United States The amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report As the US Dollar modestly strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2014 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in US Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31 2014 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31 2013 balance sheet date The increase in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31 2013 in comparison to May 31 2012 was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities our issuance of 50 billion of senior notes in October 2012 and to a lesser extent cash proceeds from fiscal 2013 stock option exercises This increase was partially offset by 110 billion of repurchases of our common stock 33 billion of net cash paid for acquisitions the repayments of 17 billion of shortterm borrowings pursuant to our expired revolving credit facilities the repayment of 125 billion of senior notes which matured in April 2013 and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders Additionally our reported cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May 31 2013 decreased in comparison to May 31 2012 due to the general strengthening of the US Dollar in comparison to certain major international currencies during fiscal 2013 Days sales outstanding which was calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter was 48 days at May 31 2014 compared with 50 days at May 31 2013 The days sales outstanding calculation excluded the impact of revenue adjustments

following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts terms which are generally one year in length We also generate significant cash from new software licenses sales and sales of hardware systems support arrangements and to a lesser extent sales of services hardware systems products and cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products taxes and leased facilities Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the following the fiscal 2013 nonrecurring impacts of a reduction of contingent consideration payable in connection with an acquisition of 387 million see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information and the impact of a 306 million noncurrent receivable related to certain litigation see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information both of which increased our net income in fiscal 2013 without the corresponding cash flow benefits These items did not recur during fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012 primarily due to cash favorable impacts of increased net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets stockbased compensation and depreciation during fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012 Cash flows from investing activities The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities We also use cash to invest in capital and other assets including certain intangible assets to support our growth Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2014 due to an increase in net cash used to purchase marketable securities net of proceeds received from sales and maturities and an increase in cash used for acquisitions net of cash acquired in each case during fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal

in each case during fiscal 2013 in comparison to fiscal 2012 Cash flows from financing activities The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases dividend payments and proceeds from stock option exercises Fiscal 2014 Compared to Fiscal 2013 Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2014 decreased in comparison to fiscal 2013 primarily due to the repayment of 30 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities and certain expired revolving credit facilities in fiscal 2013 no repayments during fiscal 2014 a net increase in borrowings during fiscal 2014 we issued 20 billion and 30 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2014 in comparison to 50 billion of senior notes issued during fiscal 2013 lower stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2014 and higher proceeds from stock option exercises during fiscal 2014 These fiscal 2014 cash favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in payments of cash dividends to stockholders in fiscal 2014 in comparison to fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2013 increased in comparison to fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in our common stock repurchases we used 110 billion of cash for common stock repurchases during fiscal 2013 in comparison to 59 billion in fiscal 2012 and an increase in repayments of borrowings we repaid 30 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities and certain expired revolving credit facilities in fiscal 2013 in comparison to the repayments of 14 billion of shortterm borrowings from expired revolving credit facilities and legacy convertible notes assumed from RightNow in fiscal 2012 partially offset by our issuance of 50 billion of senior notes in October 2012 an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises and certain other financing activity cash flow increases net 68 Table of Contents Free cash flow To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis we use nonGAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors The presentation of nonGAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity We calculate free

our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with US GAAP LongTerm Customer Financing We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products hardware systems products and services offerings through separate longterm payment contracts We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a nonrecourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets We financed 16 billion 18 billion and 16 billion respectively or approximately 17 19 and 17 respectively of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 and 168 million 161 million and 134 million respectively or approximately 6 5 and 3 respectively of our hardware systems products revenues in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 Recent Financing Activities Senior Notes As of May 31 2014 we had 242 billion of senior notes outstanding 185 billion outstanding as of May 31 2013 In July 2013 we issued 20 billion 27 billion as of May 31 2014 of fixed rate senior notes comprised of 125 billion of 225 notes due January 2021 2021 Notes and 750 million of 3125 notes due July 2025 2025 Notes and together with the 2021 Notes the Euro Notes The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange We are accounting for the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the US Dollar pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 In July 2013 we also issued 30 billion of senior notes comprised of 500 million of floating rate notes due January 2019 2019 Floating Rate Notes 15 billion of 2375 notes due January 2019 2019 Notes and 10 billion of 3625 notes due July 2023 2023 Notes and together with the Floating Rate Notes and 2019 Notes the US Dollar Notes We issued the Euro Notes and the US Dollar Notes for general corporate purposes which may include stock repurchases payment of cash dividends on our common stock and future acquisitions Additional details regarding the Euro Notes the US Dollar Notes and the related hedge accounting are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Interest Rate Swap Agreements In July 2013 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR As of May 31 2014 our 2019 Notes had an effective interest rate of 088 after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report 69 Table of Contents Cross Currency Swap Agreements In July 2013 in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes we entered into certain crosscurrency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixedrate Euro denominated 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to fixedrate US Dollar denominated debt The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in US Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the 2021 Notes at 16 billion with an annual interest rate of 353 We have designated these crosscurrency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815 Additional details regarding our senior notes and related crosscurrency swap agreements are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Cash Dividends In fiscal 2014 we declared and paid cash dividends of 048 per share that totaled 22 billion In June 2014 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 012 per share of outstanding common stock payable on July 30 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 9 2014 Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors Common Stock Repurchases Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock On June 20 2013 we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional 120 billion As of May 31 2014 approximately 43 billion remained available for stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program We repurchased 2804 million shares for 98 billion 3461 million shares for 110 billion and 2073 million shares for 60 billion in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments our debt repayment obligations described further below our stock price and economic and market conditions Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b51 plan Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time Contractual Obligations The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments Changes in our business needs cancellation provisions changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments We have presented below a summary of the

2019 Notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that the interest obligations effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBORbased index Interest payments on the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using interest rates of 129 and 088 respectively which represented our effective interest rates for these senior notes as of May 31 2014 after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and are subject to change in future periods The changes in fair values of our debt associated with the interest rate risks that we are hedging pursuant to these agreements were included in notes payable and other current borrowings for the 2014 Notes and notes payable and other noncurrent borrowings for the 2019 Notes in our consolidated balance sheet and have been included in the above table of total borrowings as of May 31 2014 Our floating rate senior notes due January 2019 bore interest at a rate of 081 as of May 31 2014 and interest payments on these notes presented in the contractual obligations table above have been estimated using this rate The 2021 Notes and the 2025 Notes are denominated in Euro In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes we entered into certain crosscurrency swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed rate Euro denominated debt including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to a fixed rate US Dollar denominated debt of 16 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 353 Principal and interest payments for the 2021 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were calculated based on the terms of the aforementioned crosscurrency swap agreements Principal and interest payments for the 2025 Notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were estimated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May 31 2014 Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities We have approximately 112 million in facility obligations net of estimated sublease income for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring in our consolidated balance sheet at May 31 2014 Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable legally binding and specify terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the payment We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture subassemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon leadtimes andor commercially standard leadtimes for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way 71 Table of Contents On June 22 2014 we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger Merger Agreement with MICROS Systems Inc MICROS a provider of integrated software hardware and services solutions to the hospitality and retail industries Pursuant to the Merger Agreement we will commence a tender offer for the outstanding shares and shares generally representing vested equity incentive awards of MICROS collectively MICROS Shares MICROS shareholders will have the right to tender their MICROS Shares to Oracle in exchange for 6800 per share in cash upon consummation of the tender offer The tender offer will commence no later than ten business days from June 22 2014 After completion of the tender offer and subject to certain limited conditions MICROS will merge with and into a whollyowned subsidiary of Oracle In addition unvested equity awards to acquire MICROS common stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the conclusion of the merger will generally be converted into equity awards denominated in shares of our common stock based on formulas contained in the Merger Agreement The estimated total purchase price for MICROS is approximately 53 billion This transaction is conditioned upon i at least a majority of the MICROS Shares being validly tendered to Oracle ii regulatory clearance under the HartScottRodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 iii the applicable merger control laws of the European Commission and other jurisdictions and iv certain other customary closing conditions We also have entered into certain other agreements to acquire other companies and expect these proposed acquisitions to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 We intend to finance our proposed acquisitions through a combination of our internally available cash our cash generated from operations our existing available debt capacity additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities As of May 31 2014 we had 45 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits including related interest and penalties recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2015 We believe that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements In addition we believe we could fund any future acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities OffBalance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors including sales force incentive compensation plans In addition our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer These seasonal factors are common in the high technology industry These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year Similarly the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues in particular our new software licenses and cloud software subscriptions segment as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the shortterm We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2015 72 Table of Contents The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters We believe that all necessary adjustments which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding Fiscal 2014 Quarter Ended Unaudited in millions except per share amounts August 31 November 30 February 28 May 31 Revenues 8372 9275 9307 11320 Gross profit 6607 7420 7490

compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders We historically have granted only stock options to our employees and any restricted stockbased awards outstanding were assumed as a result of our acquisitions We recognize that stock options and restricted stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock options and restricted stockbased awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages Consistent with these dual goals our cumulative potential dilution since June 1 2011 has been a weighted average annualized rate of 23 per year The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock options or restricted stockbased awards granted and assumed net of stock options and restricted stockbased awards forfeited by employees leaving the company divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock options are exercised and restricted stockbased awards vest Of the outstanding stock options at May 31 2014 which generally have a 10year exercise period less than 10 have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock In recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stockbased compensation program however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions to pay dividends to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes At May 31 2014 the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock options and restricted stockbased awards regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the current market price was 104 73 Table of Contents The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves the organizationwide stock option grants to selected employees all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual

Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment grade credit ratings which we believe mitigates certain risks In addition we purchase high quality debt security investments approximately 45 of which have maturity dates within one year and 55 of which have maturity dates within one to four years as of May 31 2014 see a description of our debt securities held in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and Liquidity and Capital Resources above

Our total borrowings were 242 billion as of May 31 2014 consisting of 237 billion of fixed rate borrowings and 500 million of floating rate borrowings In July 2013 we issued 20 billion 27 billion as of May 31 2014 of fixed rate senior notes and 30 billion of senior notes comprised of 500 million of floating rate notes and 25 billion of fixed rate notes as described in the Recent Financing Activities section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 in this Annual Report In July 2013 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 15 billion of 2375 senior notes due January 2019 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on the 2019 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR In September 2009 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 15 billion of 375 senior notes due July 2014 2014 Notes so that the interest payable on the 2014 Notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements and the 2019 Notes and 2014 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to match including the notional amounts and maturity dates We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed rate borrowings for trading purposes We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Note 8 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report By entering into these interest rate swap arrangements we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR As of May 31 2014 our 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes had effective interest rates of 129 and 088 respectively after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates As of May 31 2014 if LIBORbased interest rates increased by 100 basis points the change would increase our interest expense annually by approximately 22 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floating rate borrowings Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction and Translation RisksForeign Currency Borrowings and Related Hedges In July 2013 we issued 125 billion of 225 notes due January 2021 2021 Notes and we entered into certain crosscurrency swap agreements to manage the related foreign exchange risk by effectively converting the fixedrate Euro denominated debt including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to a fixedrate US Dollar denominated debt The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in US Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the 2021 Notes at 16 billion with an annual interest rate of 353 75 Table of Contents In July 2013 we also issued 750 million of 3125 notes due July 2025 2025 Notes We designated the 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the US Dollar As a result the change in the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled 34 million of net other comprehensive losses for fiscal 2014 Any remaining change in the carrying value of the 2025 Notes representing the ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in nonoperating expense income net We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2014 Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the US Dollar will impact the amount of US Dollars that we will require to settle the 2025 Notes at maturity If the US Dollar weakened by 10 in comparison to the Euro as of May 31 2014 our obligation to settle the 2025 Notes in US Dollars would have increased by approximately 102 million Foreign Currency Transaction Risk Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations Given the short duration of the forward contracts the amount recorded is not significant The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for a net unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for a net unrealized loss position The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is nonoperating expense income net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors As of May 31 2014 and 2013 the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 36 billion and 30 billion respectively As of May 31 2014 and 2013 the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 20 billion and 11 billion respectively The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31 2014 and 2013 Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in nonoperating expense income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were 375 million 162 million and 105 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were foreign currency losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiarys operations which are more thoroughly described under NonOperating Expense Income net in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future the amounts and timing of which are unknown 76 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Translation RiskImpact on Cash Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into US Dollars In particular the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report As the US Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2014 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in US Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31 2014 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31 2013 As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows the estimated effect of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in US Dollars for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 were decreases of 158 million 110 million and 471 million respectively The following table includes estimates of the US Dollar equivalent of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of May 31 2014 in millions US Dollar Equivalent at May 31 2014 Euro 1843 Indian Rupee 1172 Australian Dollar 724 Japanese Yen 550 Chinese Renminbi 535 Canadian Dollar 385 South African Rand 341 British Pound 325 Other foreign currencies 2148 Total cash cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies 8023 If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the US Dollar uniformly weakened by 10 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in US Dollars would decrease by approximately 802 million assuming constant foreign currency cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The response to this item is submitted as a separate section of this Annual Report See Part IV Item 15 Item 9 Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None Item 9A Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10K we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management including our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a15e and 15d15e Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Exchange Act such as this Annual Report on Form 10K is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the US Securities and Exchange Commission Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our 77 Table of Contents management including our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure Our quarterly evaluation of disclosure controls includes an evaluation of some components of our internal control over financial reporting We also perform a separate annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the management report below The evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design our implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this Annual Report on Form 10K In the course of the controls evaluation we reviewed data errors or control problems identified and sought to confirm that appropriate corrective actions including process improvements were being undertaken This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management including our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10Q and Form 10K Many of the components of our disclosure controls are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by both our internal audit and finance organizations The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic processes and procedures that we adjust as circumstances merit Based on our managements evaluation with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a15f and 15d15f Under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2014 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commissions 1992 framework Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles Based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31 2014 We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2014 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of Exchange Act Rules 13a15 or 15d15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management including our Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Financial Officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level However our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud A control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met Further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation 78 Table of Contents of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake Additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected Item 9B Other Information None 79 Table of Contents PART III Item 10 Directors Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Pursuant to General Instruction G3 of Form 10K the information

ACCOUNTING POLICIES Oracle Corporation develops manufactures markets hosts and supports database and middleware software application software cloud infrastructure hardware systemsincluding computer server storage and networking productsand related services that are engineered to work together in cloudbased and onpremise information technology IT environments We offer our customers the option to purchase our software and hardware systems products and related services to manage their own cloudbased or onpremise IT environments or to deploy our Oracle Cloud offerings which are a comprehensive set of cloud service offerings including cloud softwareasaservice SaaS platformasaservice PaaS and infrastructureasaservice IaaS that we manage host and support Customers that purchase our software products may elect to purchase software license updates and product support contracts which provide our customers with rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware systems support contracts which provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our server storage and networking products such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products and can include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings including consulting services advanced customer support services and education services Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977 Basis of Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracles stockholders for all periods presented The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have been included as a component of nonoperating expense income net in our consolidated statements of operations Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated We have reclassified certain revenues and expenses to conform to the current periods presentation for all periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations All such reclassifications did not affect our consolidated total revenues consolidated operating income or consolidated net income During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we added an operating segment cloud infrastructureasaservice as a result of a reorganization of financial information presented to our chief operating decision maker for operational decision and resource allocation purposes We concluded this operating segment is a reporting unit for goodwill allocation and impairment assessment purposes Acquisition related and other expenses as presented in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2013 included a change in fair value of contingent consideration payable which resulted in a net benefit of 387 million in fiscal 2013 see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements below and a 306 million benefit that we recorded in fiscal 2013 related to certain litigation see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements below Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and 89 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include 1 software and cloud revenues including new software licenses revenues earned from granting licenses to use our software products cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues generated from fees for granting customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure standardsbased cloud computing environment cloud IaaS revenues generated from fees for deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure generally on a subscription basis and software license updates and product support revenues 2 hardware systems revenues which include the sale of hardware systems products including computer servers storage products networking and data center fabric products and hardware systems support revenues and 3 services which includes software and hardware related services including consulting advanced customer support and education revenues Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services Software Elements New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database middleware and application software and exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates which are included in software license updates and product support revenues The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985605 SoftwareRevenue Recognition We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize new software licenses revenues when 1 we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software 2 we deliver the products 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties and 4 collection is probable Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions However if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy for example in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are shortterm in nature we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example acceptance provisions that are longterm in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts which are entered into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement typically one year Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period Product 90 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsSoftware Products and Software Related Services Software Arrangements We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as software related multipleelement arrangements Such software related multipleelement arrangements include the sale of our software products software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements For those software related multipleelement arrangements we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985605 Under the residual method if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multipleelement arrangement such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multipleelement arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence VSOEdescribed further below with any remaining amount allocated to the software license Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS Offerings Hardware Systems Products Hardware Systems Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Elements Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables including cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware systems products and hardware systems related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 60525 Revenue Recognition MultipleElement Arrangements and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues hardware systems products revenues and hardware related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met When applicable we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example acceptance provisions that are longterm in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloudbased IT environment that we manage host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Our cloud IaaS offerings provide deployment and management offerings for our software and hardware and related IT infrastructure including comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services arrangements for customer IT infrastructure for a stated term that is hosted at our data center facilities select partner data centers or physically onpremise at customer facilities generally for a termbased fee and virtual machine instances that are subscriptionbased and designed for computing and reliable and secure object storage Revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been 91 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 satisfied Our cloud IaaS offerings also include our Oracle Engineered Systems hardware and related support that are deployed onpremise in our customers data centers for a monthly fee and provide for the purchase of additional capacity on demand Our revenue recognition policy for these onpremise offerings is in accordance with ASC 605 and ASC 840 Leases and substantially all of these offerings are accounted for as operating leases as our contracts are structured so that the term of the arrangement is less than 75 of the economic life of the equipment and the present value of the minimum fixed payments are less than 90 of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the arrangement Our evaluation of useful life is based on our historical product development cycles and our historical customer hardware upgrade cycles Capacity on demand is a contingent payment and is therefore excluded from our assessment of the net present value of fixed payments Revenue for capacity on demand is recognized in the period our customers access additional capacity provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met Revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers storage and networking products including the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems Our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products and can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware systems support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware systems products fees Hardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements which are typically one year Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsCloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS Offerings Hardware Systems Products Hardware Systems Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Arrangements We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements Each element within a nonsoftware multipleelement arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer Further our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period or in the case of our cloud offerings generally over the estimated customer relationship period For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements For our nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy VSOE if available third party evidence TPE if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available a description as to how we determine VSOE TPE and ESP is provided below If a tangible hardware systems product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the products essential functionality and if so the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each 92 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions When possible we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support based on the renewal rates offered to customers TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including but not limited to pricing practices including discounting margin objectives competition contractually stated prices the geographies in which we offer our products and services the type of customer ie distributor value added reseller government agency and direct end user among others and the stage of the product lifecycle The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management taking into consideration our pricing model and gotomarket strategy As our or our competitors pricing and gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE TPE and ESP As a result our future revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsArrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multipleelement arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including new software licenses software license updates and product support cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware systems products hardware systems support consulting advanced customer support services and education In such arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985605 and our policies as described above After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985605 The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of services from other vendors timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenues are recognized when we receive final 93 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed When total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and nonsoftware products and services We offer these advanced support services both onpremise and remote to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services Depending upon the nature of the arrangement revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period which is generally one year or less Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructorled mediabased and internetbased training in the use of our software and hardware products Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions then new software licenses revenues andor hardware systems products revenues including the costs of hardware systems products are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method Contract accounting is applied to any bundled software and cloud hardware systems and services arrangements 1 that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees 2 where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by Oracle 3 where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted or 4 where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions when such provisions are required by law to determine the probability of possible cancellation We consider multiple factors including the history with the customer in similar transactions the essential use of the software or hardware systems products and the planning budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met If such a determination cannot be made revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met Our standard payment terms are net 30 days However payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed Payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include shortterm payment terms we have a standard practice of providing longterm financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing 94 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 division Since fiscal 1989 when our financing division was formed we have established a history of collection without concessions on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery net of any payment discounts from financing transactions We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a nonrecourse basis to third party financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows We account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables During fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 20 billion 22 billion and 16 billion of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions respectively In addition we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for the sale of our hardware systems products These leasing companies in turn lease our products to endusers The leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the enduser and we recognize revenue upon delivery if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies Concurrent Transactions Software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a threemonth time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure When we acquire goods or services from a customer we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction at terms we consider to be at arms length and settle the purchase in cash We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations in the accounting for our acquisitions It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as onetime termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations and are accounted for separately from the business combination A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities assumptions are applied regarding estimated sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made For a given acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value 95 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a preacquisition contingency nonincome tax related by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if i it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and ii the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Marketable and NonMarketable Securities In accordance with ASC 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities and based on our intentions regarding these instruments we classify substantially all of our marketable debt and equity securities as availableforsale Marketable debt and equity securities are reported at fair value with all unrealized gains losses reflected net of tax in stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets and as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income If we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value we recognize the investment loss in nonoperating expense income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required Substantially all of our marketable debt and equity investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations We hold investments in certain nonmarketable equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence These equity securities are recorded at cost and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets If based on the terms of our ownership of these nonmarketable securities we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these nonmarketable securities relate we apply the requirements of ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures to account for such investments Our nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews Fair Value of Financial Instruments We apply the provisions of ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4 Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices For those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends We writeoff a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success 96 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and trade receivables Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment grade securities We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2014 2013 or 2012 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons generally six to nine months Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware systems products expenses In addition we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete At the point of loss recognition a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Other Receivables Other receivables represent valueadded tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled 906 million and 826 million at May 31 2014 and 2013 respectively Deferred Sales Commissions We defer sales commission expenses associated with our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings and recognize the related expenses over the noncancelable term of the related contracts which are typically one to three years Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations Property Plant and Equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value net of accumulated depreciation Depreciation is computed using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives of the assets which range from one to fifty years Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms as appropriate Property plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2014 2013 or 2012 Goodwill Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives which generally range from one to ten years Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 97 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 The carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable According to ASC 350 IntangiblesGoodwill and Other we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the two step impairment test Based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the two step impairment test will be performed In the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value If the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset We did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2014 2013 or 2012 Derivative Financial Instruments During fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 we used derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks see Note 11 below for additional information We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met ie the instruments are accounted for as hedges The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change The loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings with an offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge each reporting period we record the change in fair value on the effective portion to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk being hedged For the nonderivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries the change on account of remeasurement of the effective portion for each reporting period is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets We perform the effectiveness testing of our aforementioned designated hedges on a quarterly basis and the changes in ineffective portions if any are recognized immediately in earnings Legal Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under

the associated impacts of periodic changes of Bolivar Fuerte VEF to US Dollar exchange rates in our statements of operations for each respective reporting period During fiscal 2014 the Venezuelan government issued new exchange agreements that allow for certain foreign currency transactions which previously were subject to Venezuelas official Bolivar Fuerte VEF to US Dollar exchange rate the Official Rate to be subject to conversion at rates established at the Venezuelan governments auctionbased exchange rate programs the Complementary System for Foreign Currency Administration SICAD

During fiscal 2013 we also incurred a foreign currency remeasurement loss of 64 million related to our Venezuelan subsidiary due to the devaluation of the VEF official exchange rate by the Venezuelan government Future devaluations of the Venezuelan currency are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international we could experience additional foreign currency volatility and incur additional remeasurement losses in the future the amounts and timing of which are unknown Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized A twostep approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement We recognize interest and penalties related to

MEASUREMENTS We perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820 ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value An assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities or Level 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities 106 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

credit ratings were derived from the following nonbinding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data quoted market prices for similar instruments or pricing models such as

Deferred revenues current 7269 7118 Deferred revenues noncurrent in other noncurrent liabilities 404 312 Total deferred revenues 7673 7430 Deferred software license updates and product support revenues and deferred hardware systems support revenues represent customer payments made in advance for support contracts that are typically billed on a per annum basis in advance with corresponding revenues being recognized ratably over the support periods Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed Deferred cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues typically result from our cloudbased offerings that are typically billed in advance and recognized over the corresponding contractual term Deferred new software licenses revenues typically result from undelivered products or specified enhancements customer specific acceptance provisions customer payments made in advance for timebased license arrangements and software license transactions that cannot be segmented from undelivered consulting or other services In connection with our acquisitions we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS software license updates and product support and hardware systems support obligations amongst others assumed from our acquired companies We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost buildup approach The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud SaaS and PaaS software license updates and product support and hardware systems support deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the postcombination periods 11 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges Interest Rate Swap Agreements In July 2013 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our January 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR In September 2009 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with our 2014 Notes so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements and the January 2019 Notes and 2014 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to match including the notional amounts and maturity dates We have designated the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 These transactions are characterized as fair value 114 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixed rate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other current liabilities for the 2014 Notes and other assets or other noncurrent liabilities for the January 2019 Notes in our consolidated balance sheets The amount of net gain loss attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable current and other current borrowings for the 2014 Notes and notes payable and other noncurrent borrowings for the January 2019 Notes The periodic interest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for the 2014 Notes and January 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense We do not use any interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes Cash Flow Hedges Cross Currency Swap Agreements In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes we entered into certain crosscurrency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixedrate Euro denominated 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to fixedrate US Dollar denominated debt The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in US Dollars associated with the 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the 2021 Notes at 16 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 353 We have designated these crosscurrency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815 The critical terms of the crosscurrency swap agreements correspond to the 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments being hedged and the crosscurrency swap agreements mature at the same time as the 2021 Notes We used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our crosscurrency swap agreements The fair values of these crosscurrency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these crosscurrency swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into nonoperating expense income net in the same period that the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2021 Notes is remeasured and the interest expense is recognized The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these crosscurrency swaps if any is recorded immediately to nonoperating expense income net We evaluate the effectiveness of our crosscurrency swap agreements on a quarterly basis We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2014 We do not use any crosscurrency swap agreements for trading purposes Net Investment Hedge Foreign Currency Borrowings In July 2013 we designated our Euro denominated 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the US Dollar We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedge Under this method for each reporting period the change in the carrying value of the Euro denominated 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion if any is recognized in nonoperating expense income net in our consolidated statements of operations We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the beginning of every quarter We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2014 115 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for a net unrealized

Employee Stock Purchase Plan We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan Purchase Plan that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95 of the fair market value of

Total defined contribution plan expense was 357 million 353 million and 344 million for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively The number of plan participants in our benefit plans has generally

of foreign subsidiaries in countries with lower statutory rates than the United States the earnings of which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States If these subsidiaries generate sufficient earnings in the future our provision for income taxes may continue to be favorably affected to a meaningful extent although any such favorable effects could be significantly reduced under a variety of circumstances At May 31 2014 the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately 324 billion and 69 billion respectively If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States or if the other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction At May 31 2014 assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately 100 billion and 22 billion respectively Our net deferred tax assets were 14 billion and 15 billion as of May 31 2014 and 2013 respectively We believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future Realization of our net deferred tax

extraterritorial income exemptions domestic production activity foreign tax credits and research and development credits taken Other issues are related to years with expiring statutes of limitation With all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate we believe it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2014 the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a 126 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 combination of both in the next 12 months by as much

longer subject to audit for those periods Internationally tax authorities for numerous nonUS jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits We believe it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2014 the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both by as much as 190 million 142 million net of offsetting tax benefits in the next 12 months related primarily to transfer pricing Other issues are related to years with expiring statutes of limitation With some exceptions we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in nonUS jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997 We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to our tax audits and that any settlement will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations However there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes We previously negotiated three successive unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the IRS from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements These agreements were effective for fiscal years through May 31 2006 We have reached final agreement with the IRS for renewal of this Advance Pricing Agreement for the years ending May 31 2007 through May 31 2013 However these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing and do not bind tax authorities outside the United States We have finalized bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements which are effective for the years ending May 31 2004 through May 31 2006 and May 31 2007 through May 31 2013 16 SEGMENT INFORMATION

STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 18 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS SAP Intellectual Property Litigation On March 22 2007 Oracle Corporation Oracle USA Inc and Oracle International Corporation collectively Oracle filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against SAP AG its whollyowned subsidiary SAP America Inc and its whollyowned subsidiary TomorrowNow Inc the SAP Subsidiary and collectively the SAP Defendants alleging that SAP unlawfully accessed Oracles Customer Connection support website and improperly took and used Oracles intellectual property Trial commenced on November 1 2010 on the issue of damages as SAP had stipulated to liability The jury awarded Oracle 13 billion On September 1 2011 the court granted the SAP Defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial The court vacated the 13 billion award and held that Oracle could either accept a reduced amount or remittitur of 272 million or proceed to a new trial On February 6 2012 Oracle rejected the remittitur and requested a new trial On August 2 2012 Oracle and the SAP Defendants stipulated to a judgment of 306 million against the SAP Defendants in lieu of having a second jury trial while preserving both parties rights to appeal prior court orders We recorded a 306 million noncurrent receivable included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet and we recognized a corresponding benefit to our results of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 Previously during trial we received payment of 120 million in attorneys fees from SAP under a stipulation and we recorded this payment upon receipt as a benefit to our results of operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 On August 3 2012 the court entered the judgment and vacated the date set for the new trial Oracle filed a Notice of Appeal on August 31 2012 and the SAP Defendants filed a notice of appeal on September 14 2012 The SAP Defendants subsequently dismissed their appeal Oracles appeal has been fully briefed The appellate court heard oral argument on May 13 2014 The court has not yet ruled on this appeal HewlettPackard Company Litigation On June 15 2011 HewlettPackard Company HP filed a complaint in the California Superior Court County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing defamation intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HPs Itaniumbased servers it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd the Hurd Settlement Agreement who was both HPs former chief executive officer and chairman of HPs board of directors HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief Oracle answered the complaint and filed a crosscomplaint which was amended on December 2 2011 The amended crosscomplaint alleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor and had misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap among other claims Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief The court bifurcated the trial and tried HPs causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012 The court issued a final statement of decision on August 28 2012 finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HPs Itaniumbased servers and to port such products at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers Oracle has announced that it is appealing this decision The issues of breach HPs performance causation and damages HPs tort claims and Oracles crossclaims will all be tried before a jury As of April 8 2013 the trial is stayed pending Oracles appeal of the courts denial of its antiSLAPP motion which is fully briefed although 132 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2014 oral argument has not yet been scheduled We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action and we will continue to vigorously defend it Derivative Litigations and Related Action On September 30 2011 a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery and a second stockholder was permitted to intervene as a plaintiff on November 15 2011 At an August 22 2012 hearing the court dismissed certain claims but permitted certain claims for breach of fiduciary duty to proceed On May 3 2013 plaintiffs filed an amended complaint The derivative suit is brought by two alleged stockholders of Oracle purportedly on Oracles behalf against one former director and all but two of our current directors including against our Chief Executive Officer as an alleged controlling stockholder Plaintiffs allege that Oracles directors breached their fiduciary duties in agreeing to purchase Pillar Data Systems Inc at an excessive price Oracles acquisition of Pillar is structured as an earn out under which Oracle is scheduled to make a single payment if any by November 30 2014 to Pillars former shareholders based on an agreedupon EarnOut formula Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief rescission of the Pillar Data transaction damages disgorgement of our Chief Executive Officers alleged profits disgorgement of all compensation earned by defendants as a result of their service on Oracles Board or any committee of the Board and an award of attorneys fees and costs On June 13 2014 plaintiffs and defendants filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise Settlement and Release under which our Chief Executive Officer agreed to pay to Oracle 95 of any and all amounts if any that are paid to him under the Pillar earn out Oracle will pay plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs which will not exceed 15 million The settlement is subject to approval by the Delaware Chancery Court which has scheduled a fairness hearing for August 12 2014 at 1000 am Eastern Time While the outcome of the derivative litigation cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the outcome will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized if any Other Litigation We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims either asserted or unasserted which arise in the ordinary course of business including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters individually or in the aggregate will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized if any 133 Table of Contents
