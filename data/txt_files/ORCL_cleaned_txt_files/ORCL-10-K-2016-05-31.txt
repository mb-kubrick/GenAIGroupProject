We directly market and sell our products and services to businesses of many sizes and in many industries government agencies and educational institutions We also market and sell our offerings through indirect channels No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 In the United States our sales and services employees are based in our headquarters and in field offices throughout the country Outside the United States our international subsidiaries sell support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales subsidiary Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings Our international operations subject us to certain risks which are more fully described in Risk Factors included in Item 1A of 17 Table of Contents this Annual Report A summary of our domestic and international revenues and longlived assets is set forth in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report We also market our product offerings worldwide through indirect channels The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network The Oracle Partner Network is a global program that manages our business relationships with a large broadbased network of companies including independent software and hardware vendors system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon our product offerings By offering our partners access to our product offerings educational information technical services marketing and sales support the Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and valueadded resellers Seasonality and Cyclicality Our quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans which are common in the technology industry In each fiscal year our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter The operating margins of our businesses in particular our cloud software and onpremise software and hardware segments are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term See Selected Quarterly Financial Data in Item 7 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues expenses and margins Competition We face intense competition in all aspects of our business The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge expand or are acquired as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change Our customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation sourcing integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software and hardware Our enterprise cloud and onpremise software and hardware offerings compete directly with some offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world including Microsoft Corporation Microsoft International Business Machines Corporation IBM Intel HewlettPackard Enterprise SAP SE and Amazoncom Inc and smaller companies like salesforcecom inc and Workday Inc as well as many others In addition due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions or offerings focused on a specific functionality product area or industry In addition as we expand into new market segments we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed Moreover we or our competitors may take certain strategic actionsincluding acquisitions partnerships and joint ventures or repositioning of product lineswhich invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include total cost of ownership performance scalability reliability security functionality efficiency speed to production and quality of technical support Our product and service sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following among other things the adoption of cloudbased IT offerings including SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings ease of deployment use and maintenance of our products and services offerings compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within onpremise IT environments and public cloud IT environments including our Oracle Cloud environments 18 Table of Contents the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors the broader platform competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the NET programming environment of Microsoft operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems with alternatives including Microsofts Windows Server and other UNIX and Linux operating systems the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers products features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff products features or functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants systems integrators or other third parties and attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers For more information about the competitive risks we face refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report Oracle Cloud Operations Oracle Cloud Operations delivers our SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings to customers through the Oracle Cloud which is a secure reliable scalable enterprise grade platform that is deployed upon Oracles application platform and infrastructure products and is managed by Oracle employees within a global network of data centers The Oracle Cloud enables secure and isolated cloudbased instances for each of our customers to access the functionality of our SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings via a broad spectrum of devices and leverages automated software lifecycle management to enable the rapid delivery of the latest cloud technology capabilities as they become available Manufacturing To produce our hardware products we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as thirdparty manufacturing partners Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement assembly testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers storage products and networking products For all other manufacturing we generally rely on thirdparty manufacturing partners to produce our hardwarerelated components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly testing and quality control processes for these components and products We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities Our manufacturing processes substantially are based on standardization of components across product types centralization of assembly and distribution centers and a buildtoorder methodology in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials supplies product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of vendors For most of our hardware products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available However we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products As a result we continue to evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations Refer to Risk Factors included in Item 1A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business Research and Development We develop the substantial majority of our product offerings internally In addition we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology While we believe that our patents have value no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal business segments Research and development expenditures were 58 billion 55 billion and 52 billion in fiscal 2016 19 Table of Contents 2015 and 2014 respectively or 16 14 and 13 of total revenues in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions offerings and enhancements characterize the cloud and onpremise software and hardware markets in which

that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict The following discussion as well as our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 highlights some of these risks The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities Our Oracle Cloud strategy including our Oracle Software as a Service SaaS Platform as a Service PaaS Infrastructure as a Service IaaS and Data as a Service DaaS offerings may adversely affect our revenues and profitability We offer customers a full range of consumption models including the deployment of our products via our cloudbased SaaS PaaS IaaS and DaaS offerings These business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our onpremise enterprise software offerings and our cloud offerings and has a dampening impact on overall demand for our onpremise software product and service offerings which has reduced and could continue to reduce our revenues and profitability at least in the near term If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our new software licenses and hardware arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements Customers generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions The deferred revenue that results from sales of our cloud offerings may prevent any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings from becoming immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations This is in contrast to revenues associated with our new software licenses arrangements whereby new software licenses revenues are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of 21 Table of Contents the related software licenses We incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings We have also acquired a number of cloud computing companies and the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient or scalable as anticipated which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services Rapid technological advances changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand customers may not purchase or subscribe to our software hardware or cloud offerings or renew software support hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business In addition we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud and onpremise software and hardware products and services including our Database Multitenant Database InMemory SaaS PaaS IaaS DaaS and Oracle Engineered Systems offerings Our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames there is a delay in market acceptance of a new enhanced or acquired product line or service there are changes in information technology IT trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services or we fail to adequately integrate support or enhance acquired product lines or services If our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result our data our customers data or our IT systems are accessed improperly made unavailable or improperly modified our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable our brand and reputation could be damaged the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using our products and services all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions We are in the IT business and our products and services including our Oracle Cloud offerings store retrieve manipulate and manage our customers information and data external data as well as our own data We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products services and the internal and external data that we manage At times we encounter attempts by third parties to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities penetrate or bypass our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers partners and suppliers software hardware and cloud offerings networks and systems any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers Computer hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products and services exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our products and services create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service This is also true for thirdparty data products or services incorporated into our own Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer partner employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers partners employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data our customers suppliers or partners data or the IT systems of Oracle its customers suppliers or partners 22 Table of Contents Highprofile security breaches at other companies have increased in recent years and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting IT products and businesses Although this is an industrywide problem that affects other software and hardware companies it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most prominent IT companies and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for and marketing efforts associated with having secure products and services These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of data including personal information and our customers confidential information and data and other external data and host or manage parts of our customers businesses in cloudbased IT environments especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences financial services and the government We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies products services and technologies over the years While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle We could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers or suppliers data other external data or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted or if our products or services are perceived as having security vulnerabilities Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services including our cloud offerings and perceive them to be not secure This could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenue and earnings The costs we would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits regulatory investigations and claims and increased legal liability including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring Our business practices with respect to the collection use and management of personal information could give rise to operational interruption liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify For example in October 2015 the Court of Justice of the European Union EU invalidated the EUUS Safe Harbor Framework which Oracle as well as many other global enterprises had relied on in certain contexts to enable the transfer of EU personal data to the United States While Oracle adapted to this judgment by implementing other transfer mechanisms permitted under applicable law the validity of these other mechanisms could also be challenged If successful this could require Oracle to make disruptive operational adjustments to the delivery of certain services that could impact customers and sales in the region In addition US and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations in a manner that could significantly impact the ability of Oracle and our customers and data partners to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services Oracle provides and data services This could be true particularly in those jurisdictions where privacy laws or regulators take a broader view of how personal information is defined therefore subjecting the handling of such data to heightened restrictions that may be obstructive to the operations of Oracle and its customers and data providers This impact may be acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized in country as this imposes financial costs on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdictions not of its choosing and nonstandard operational processes that are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations and the EU is considering legislation that would impose fines for privacy violations based on a percentage of global revenues Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data such as healthcare data or other personal information could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain of our services in jurisdictions that we operate Additionally public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly in ways that may affect Oracles reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit Oracles ability to provide certain 23 Table of Contents products Any failure or perceived failure by Oracle to comply with US federal state or foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations regulating privacy data security or consumer protection or other policies public perception standards selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in lost or restricted business proceedings actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation We might experience significant coding manufacturing or configuration errors in our software hardware and cloud offerings Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service our software hardware and cloud offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors that can impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences The detection and correction of any errors in released software hardware or cloud offerings can be time consuming and costly Errors in our software hardware or cloud offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other software hardware or cloud offerings could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services This includes thirdparty software products or services incorporated into our own If we experience errors or delays in releasing our software hardware or cloud offerings or new versions thereof our sales could be affected and revenues could decline In addition we run Oracles business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks Therefore any flaws could affect our ability to conduct our business operations and the operations of our customers Enterprise customers rely on our software hardware and cloud offerings and services to run their businesses and errors in our software hardware or cloud offerings could expose us to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation which could impact our future sales We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors Our revenues particularly our new software licenses revenues and hardware revenues are difficult to forecast As a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially We use a pipeline system a common industry practice to forecast sales and trends in our business Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate A reduction in the conversion rate or in the pipeline itself could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations In particular a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms which can also impede our ability to negotiate execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner In addition for newly acquired companies we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition Conversion rates postacquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies historical conversion rates Differences in conversion rates can also be affected by changes in business practices that we implement in our newly acquired companies These changes may negatively affect customer behavior A substantial portion of our new software licenses and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are larger orders Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability The number of large new software licenses transactions and to a lesser extent hardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions We may experience foreign currency gains and losses Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the US Dollar Changes in the values of major foreign currencies 24 Table of Contents particularly the Euro Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the US Dollar can significantly affect our total assets revenues operating results and cash flows which are reported in US Dollars In particular the economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt obligations may cause the value of the Euro to fluctuate relative to the US Dollar Fluctuations in foreign currency rates most notably the recent strengthening of the US Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in US Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into US Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as these products become relatively more expensive for foreign currencybased enterprises to purchase In addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States Generally our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens In addition our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a significant portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits among other assets are held in foreign currencies The US Dollar generally strengthened relative to other currencies including the Euro in fiscal 2016 which is reflected in our results In addition we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term which are charged against earnings in the period incurred We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures We may suspend the program from time to time As a part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses A large portion of our consolidated operations are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts For example we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or costeffective to hedge our foreign currency exposures if our hedging efforts are ineffective or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows Certain of our international subsidiaries operate in economies that have been designated as highly inflationary We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in these highly inflationary economies relative to the US Dollar and we may continue to incur such losses in these countries or other emerging market countries where we do business Economic political and market conditions can adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting These include general economic and business conditions overall demand for enterprise software cloud offerings hardware and services governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities and general political developments Macroeconomic developments like the continued slow pace of economic recovery in Europe and parts of the United States Asia and South America could negatively affect our business operating results financial condition and outlook which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Any general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services 25 Table of Contents In addition political unrest in places like Ukraine Syria and Iraq and the related potential impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of new software licenses hardware products hardware support and related services and to a lesser extent also may affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support and our subscriptionbased cloud offerings If we are unable to compete effectively the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed We face intense competition in all aspects of our business The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge expand or are acquired as technology evolves and as delivery models change Many vendors develop and market databases middleware products application development tools business applications collaboration products and business intelligence products among others that compete with our cloud and onpremise software offerings These vendors include onpremise software companies and companies that offer cloudbased SaaS PaaS IaaS and DaaS offerings and business process outsourcing BPO as competitive alternatives to buying software and hardware Our competitors that offer business applications and middleware products may influence a customers purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products add new functionality acquire competitive products reduce prices better execute on their sales and marketing strategies or form strategic alliances with other companies We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense Our hardware business competes with among others 1 systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating systems and those of our competitors 2 microprocessorchip manufacturers 3 providers of storage products 4 certain industryspecific hardware manufacturers including those serving communications hospitality and retail industries and 5 certain cloud providers that build their own IT infrastructure Our hardware business causes us to compete with certain companies that historically have been partners Some of these competitors may have more experience than we do in managing a hardware business A large portion of our hardware products are based on our SPARC microprocessor and Oracle Solaris operating system platform which has a smaller installed base than certain of our competitors platforms and which may make it difficult for us to win new customers that have already made significant investments in our competitors platforms Certain of these competitors also compete very aggressively on price A loss in our competitive position could result in lower revenues or profitability which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardware business We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our onpremise enterprise software offerings and our cloud offerings as well as overall demand for our onpremise software product and service offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability Our software license updates and product support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net new software licenses fees and net new hardware products fees respectively Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings or support pricing Any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations These practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our 26 Table of Contents products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the United States Our international operations include software and hardware development manufacturing assembly cloud operations sales customer support consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers Compliance with international and US laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions These laws and regulations include US laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results Compliance with these laws requires a significant amount of management attention and effort which may divert managements attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded Where circumstances warrant we provide information and report our findings to government authorities but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries including those related to general economic conditions in each country or region fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to customer demand and our operating results difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries such as Venezuela that have led to a devaluation of our net assets in particular our cash assets in that countrys currency regulatory changes including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries political unrest terrorism and the potential for other hostilities including those in Ukraine Syria and Iraq common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics practices and conduct policies natural disasters the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding wildfires and increased storm sensitivity longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable overlapping tax regimes our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates public health risks particularly in areas in which we have significant operations and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 27 Table of Contents The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware products segment and the sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited OFSS a publicly traded company in India and Oracle Corporation Japan NOKK a publicly traded company in Japan we are faced with several additional risks including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if OFSS or NOKK were whollyowned subsidiaries Acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction We continue to invest billions of dollars to acquire companies products services and technologies We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include our ongoing business may be disrupted and our managements attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities we may have difficulties 1 managing an acquired companys technologies or lines of business 2 entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions or 3 retaining key personnel from the acquired companies an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected we may impose our business practices or alter gotomarket strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition including among others claims from government agencies terminated employees current or former customers former stockholders or other third parties preexisting contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired companys practices and intellectual property claims or disputes we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes due a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons including if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew software or hardware support contracts or cloudbased subscription contracts if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies products services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of business and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards architecture controls procedures and policies we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered priced and supported differently which could cause customer confusion and delays we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products or services in general and administrative functions that support new business models or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated 28 Table of Contents we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from or may otherwise have certain limitations restrictions penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis if at all which could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash including stock repurchases dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness we may significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease and we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to US generally accepted accounting principles including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions Our hardware revenues and profitability could decline if we do not manage the risks associated with our hardware business Our hardware business may adversely affect our overall profitability if we do not effectively manage the associated risks We may not achieve our estimated revenue profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors including demand for competing hardware technologies such as cloud infrastructure compute and storage services which could adversely affect demand for our hardware products offerings our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues and thus has been less profitable than our cloud and onpremise software business our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud Oracle Exalytics InMemory Machine and Oracle SuperCluster products which are in the relatively early stages of adoption by our customers and the deemphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products which could adversely affect our hardware revenues because the lower profit products have historically constituted a larger portion of our hardware revenues as we develop and introduce new versions or next generations of our hardware products customers may defer or delay purchases of existing hardware products and wait for these new releases all of which could adversely affect our hardware revenues in the short term a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results such as potential writedowns and impairments of our inventories higher warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and onpremise software and services businesses and amortization and potential impairment of intangible assets associated with our hardware business we may not be able to increase sales of hardware support contracts or such increase may take longer than we anticipate which could result in lower revenues and profitability or slower than expected growth of such revenues and profitability and 29 Table of Contents we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but 1 operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operating margins than our own 2 have different legacy business practices and gotomarket strategies than our own that we may alter as a part of our integration efforts which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company 3 leverage different platforms or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating or 4 utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquired products within our own manufacturing operations Our hardware offerings are complex products and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity the results of our hardware business will suffer Designing developing manufacturing and introducing new hardware products are complicated processes The development process for our hardware products is uncertain and requires a high level of innovation After the development phase we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do so in a costeffective manner Our buildtoorder manufacturing model in which our hardware products generally are not built until after customers place orders may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware products to customers in a timely manner These delays could cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors We must also manage new hardware product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchases of existing hardware products in anticipation of new hardware product releases It is also possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws which could delay or prevent the production of the components for which we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardware products to be returned recalled or rejected resulting in lost revenues increases in warranty costs or costs related to remediation efforts damage to our reputation penalties and litigation We depend on suppliers to design develop manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price quality technology availability or other business constraints As a result our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation natural disasters political unrest port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience significant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies parts or components from a particular vendor If we had to find a new supplier for these technologies parts and components hardware product shipments could be delayed which would adversely affect our hardware revenues We could also experience fluctuations in component prices which if unanticipated could negatively impact our hardware business cost structure Additionally we could experience changes in shipping and logistics of our hardware products which could result in fluctuations in prices and negatively impact our hardware margins These factors may make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a timely fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware products Therefore we may experience component inventory shortages which may result in production delays or customers choosing to purchase fewer hardware products from us or hardware products from our competitors We negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient technologies and components for our hardware products to meet anticipated customer demand We must also manage our levels of older component inventories used in our hardware products to minimize inventory writeoffs or writedowns If we have excess inventory it may be necessary to writedown the inventory which would adversely affect our operating results If one or more of the risks described above occurs our hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected We are susceptible to thirdparty manufacturing and logistics delays which could result in the loss of sales and customers We outsource the design manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the United States Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs product supply and delivery delays as well as the political and economic uncertainties and natural disasters of the international locations where certain of these thirdparty 30 Table of Contents manufacturers have facilities and operations Some countries may raise national security concerns or impose market access restrictions based on location of manufacture or sourcing Any manufacturing disruption or logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for these hardware products for extended periods of time If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively or if these third parties experience delays disruptions capacity constraints regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our hardware products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware business could be harmed We have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of thirdparty manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these thirdparty manufacturers build our hardware products We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturing partners and locations If these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timely or costeffective manner if at all If we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled hardware products deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses all of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business These challenges and risks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware products and related supply chain operations In some cases we may be dependent at least initially on these acquired companies supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these challenges and risks Our software and hardware indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results Our software and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers system integratorsimplementers consultants education providers internet service providers network integrators and independent software vendors Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our software and hardware marketing and sales efforts Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants products and services were to decrease There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants If we are not successful we may lose sales opportunities customers and revenues We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights We rely on copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights Despite our efforts these protections may be limited Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property Any patents owned by us may be invalidated circumvented or challenged Any of our pending or future patent applications whether or not being currently challenged may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek if at all In addition the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the United States If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive Third parties have claimed and in the future may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights andor breach of license agreement provisions We periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse We expect to continue to receive such claims as we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows 31 Table of Contents the use and support of thirdparty code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the industry the volume of issued patents continues to increase and the proliferation of nonpracticing entities asserting intellectual property infringement claims increases Responding to any such claim regardless of its validity could be time consuming costly and result in litigation divert managements time and attention from developing our business require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products require us to release source code to third parties possibly under open source license terms require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers or otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows Our periodic workforce restructurings including reorganizations of our sales force can be disruptive We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily in response to management changes product changes performance issues change in strategies acquisitions and other internal and external considerations In the past these types of sales force restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs increased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the sales teams adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities In addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings or do so within the expected timeframe These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management including our Chairman of the Board of Directors Chief Technology Officer and founder our Chief Executive Officers other members of our executive team and other key employees In the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel With rare exceptions we do not have longterm employment or noncompetition agreements with our employees Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs When we make adjustments to our workforce we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program Our general compensation program includes restricted stock units performance stock units and stock options which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry If our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stockbased compensation which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel 32 Table of Contents Our sales to government clients expose us to business volatility and risks including government budgeting cycles and appropriations early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties We derive revenues from contracts with the US government state and local governments and foreign governments and their respective agencies which may terminate most of these contracts at any time without cause There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending Further our US federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations made by the US Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts Similarly our contracts with US state and local governments foreign governments and their agencies are generally subject to government funding authorizations Additionally government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all Developing software cloud and hardware offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired Accelerated product and service introductions and short software and hardware life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position However we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all Business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services including some of our cloud offerings A major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected Adverse litigation results could affect our business We are subject to various legal proceedings Litigation can be lengthy expensive and disruptive to our operations and can divert our managements attention away from running our core business The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business operating results or financial condition Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities As a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities We are regularly under audit by tax authorities and those authorities often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate For example the United States many countries in the EU and other countries where we do business are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals which could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate Further in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the US Internal Revenue Service IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future Although we have negotiated certain unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS and certain selected bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements that cover some of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the relevant tax authorities from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements these agreements do not cover 33 Table of Contents substantial elements of our transfer pricing In recent periods transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become increasingly contentious Similarly certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters In addition our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States that have lower statutory tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates We are also subject to nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome based taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome based tax liabilities Our acquisition activities have increased our nonincome based tax exposures particularly with our entry into the hardware business which increased the volume and complexity of laws and regulations that we are subject to and with which we must comply Although we believe that our income and nonincome based tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to ASC 805 Business Combinations we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and in each case separately from goodwill Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred which is also generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain After we complete an acquisition the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention redeployment or relocation expenses impairment of goodwill in particular within our consulting reporting unit or impairment of intangible assets both asset types of which have increased in recent years due to our acquisitions and may continue to increase in the future amortization of intangible assets acquired a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities both income tax and nonincome tax related after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period generally up to one year from the acquisition date whichever comes first charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative premerger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities for a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated charges to eliminate certain duplicative premerger activities and charges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition and charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred For example we recognized a goodwill impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 relating to our hardware reporting unit Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 34 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness As of May 31 2016 we had an aggregate of 439 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2016 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt Furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase Should we incur future increases in interest expense our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our US federal income tax could be limited which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate In addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs Some of our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state federal and international laws governing protection of the environment proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products human health and safety the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers We endeavor to comply with these environmental and other laws yet compliance with these environmental and other laws could increase our product design development procurement manufacturing delivery cloud operations and administration costs limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete noncompliant inventory change our sales activities or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability including fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses The US Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain conflict minerals commonly referred to as tantalum tin tungsten and gold in their products Our supply chain is multitiered global and highly complex As a provider of hardware end products we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain Accordingly our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited Our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales Environmental legislation such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances RoHS the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive WEEE Directive and Chinas regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements The cumulative impact of international environmental legislation could be significant Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new

to fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 were significantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the US Dollar which decreased our fiscal 2016 and 2015 total revenues by 5 and 4 percentage points respectively total operating expenses by 4 and 3 percentage points respectively and total operating income by 7 and 6 percentage points respectively in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods Total working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during all periods presented and the issuances of longterm senior notes of 200 billion in fiscal 2015 20 billion and 30 billion in fiscal 2014 and 50 billion in fiscal 2013 Our total assets were also favorably impacted by the issuance of 38 billion of short term borrowings in fiscal 2016 These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions repurchases of our common stock dividend payments and capital expenditures made in all periods presented and the repayments of certain of our senior notes in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2013 Our notes payable and other borrowings which represented the summation of our notes payable current and other current borrowings and notes payable and other noncurrent borrowings as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above increased between fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2016 due to the issuances of 38 billion of shortterm borrowings made pursuant to our revolving credit agreements in fiscal 2016 and the issuances of longterm senior notes of 200 billion in fiscal 2015 20 billion and 30 billion in fiscal 2014 and 50 billion in fiscal 2013 See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our notes payable and other borrowings 39 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses key operating segments and significant trends This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition Business Overview Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology IT environmentsapplication platform and infrastructure Our Oracle Cloud offerings provide a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of application platform compute and storage services in all three primary layers of the cloud Software as a Service SaaS Platform as a Service PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service IaaS Our onpremise offerings include Oracle database and middleware software application software hardware Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage networking and industryspecific products and related support and services We provide our cloud and onpremise offerings to over 400000 worldwide customers via deployment models that best suit their needs Our comprehensive and fully integrated stack of SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings integrate the software hardware and services on the customers behalf in IT environments that we deploy support and manage for the customer Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between cloud and onpremise IT environments compatible to easily move workloads between onpremise IT environments and the Oracle Cloud costeffective by requiring lower upfront customer investment and secure standardsbased and reliable We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud IT environments including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications virtualization clustering largescale systems management and related infrastructure Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services our partners cloud services and our customers cloud IT environments In addition to providing a broad spectrum of cloud offerings we develop and sell our products and services to our customers worldwide for use in their global data centers and onpremise IT environments An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in and innovation with respect to our products and services that we offer through our cloud and onpremise software hardware and services businesses We have a deep understanding as to how all components within IT environmentsapplication platform and infrastructureinteract and function with one another We focus our development efforts on improving the performance security operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more costeffective and easier to deploy manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services our customers can continue to take advantage of our research and development investments and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our Oracle EBusiness Suite Siebel PeopleSoft and JD Edwards application software products among others or by renewing their SaaS PaaS and IaaS contracts with us As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT resources are deployed and managed through the Oracle Cloud while other of their IT resources are deployed and managed onpremise and both sets of resources can be managed as one We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect these different deployment models to enable flexibility ease agility compatibility extensibility and seamlessness A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy We believe our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers expand our customer base provide greater scale to accelerate innovation grow our revenues and earnings and increase stockholder value In recent years we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies products services and 40 Table of Contents technologies that add to are complementary to or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings We expect to continue to acquire companies products services and technologies to further our corporate strategy We have three businesses that deliver our application platform and infrastructure technologies cloud and onpremise software hardware and services These businesses can be further divided into certain operating segments Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our operating segments Each of our businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges Although we report our actual results in US Dollars we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than US Dollars Therefore we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations An overview of our three businesses and related operating segments follows Cloud and OnPremise Software Business Our cloud and onpremise software business which represented 78 77 and 76 of our total revenues in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively is comprised of three operating segments 1 cloud software and onpremise software 2 cloud IaaS and 3 software license updates and product support On a constant currency basis we expect that our cloud and onpremise software business total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products expected growth in our cloud and software license updates and product support offerings including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts and contributions from our acquisitions which should allow us to grow and continue to make investments in research and development Cloud Software and OnPremise Software Our cloud software and onpremise software line of business markets sells and delivers a broad spectrum of application and platform technologies through our SaaS and PaaS offerings which are certain of our software applications and platforms that are delivered via a cloudbased IT environment that we host manage and support and through the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications Oracle Database Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java among others We believe the comprehensiveness and breadth of our SaaS PaaS and onpremise software offerings provides greater benefit to our customers and differentiates us from many of our competitors that offer more limited or specialized software offerings Our SaaS and PaaS offerings are designed to be interoperable with one another thereby limiting the integration and tuning of multiple cloud applications from multiple vendors Our SaaS and PaaS offerings are designed to deliver secure data isolation and flexible upgrades selfservice access controls for users a ServiceOriented Architecture SOA for integration with onpremise systems and a high performance high availability infrastructure based on our infrastructure technologies including Oracle Engineered Systems Our onpremise software offerings are substantially designed to operate on both single server and clustered server configurations for cloud or onpremise IT environments and to support a choice of operating systems including Oracle Solaris Oracle Linux Microsoft Windows and thirdparty UNIX products among others Our commitment to industry standards results in software offerings that work in customer environments with Oracle or nonOracle hardware or software components and that can be adapted to meet specific industry or business needs We focus the engineering of our products and services to best connect cloud and onpremise deployment models to enable flexibility ease agility compatibility extensibility and seamlessness All of these approaches are designed to support customer choice and reduce customer risk Our customers include businesses of many sizes government agencies educational institutions and resellers We market and sell our software offerings to these customers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best fit customer needs We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them Our SaaS and PaaS revenues and new software licenses revenues are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints the strategy for and competitive position of our software offerings our acquisitions our ability to deliver and renew our SaaS and PaaS contracts with our existing customers and foreign currency rate fluctuations In recent periods we have placed significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues which has affected the growth of our cloud SaaS and 41 Table of Contents PaaS revenues and our new software licenses revenues and the related expenses We expect these trends will continue Our SaaS and PaaS arrangements are generally one to three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal The substantial majority of our new software license transactions are characterized by long sales cycles and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues Cloud software and onpremise software revenues represented 25 26 and 28 of our total revenues in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively Our cloud software and onpremise software segments margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short term As discussed further below under Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges our cloud software and onpremise software segments margin has been and will continue to be affected by the fair value adjustments relating to the cloud SaaS and PaaS obligations that we assumed in our business combinations and by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies and technologies that we have acquired Cloud Infrastructure as a Service Our cloud IaaS segment which represented 2 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2016 and 2015 and 1 of our total revenues in fiscal 2014 provides infrastructure cloud services that are enterprisegrade hosted and supported within the Oracle Cloud to perform elastic compute storage and networking services on a subscription basis Our cloud IaaS segment also offers Oracle Managed Cloud Services which are comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customer IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term that are hosted at our Oracle data center facilities select partner data centers or physically onpremise at customer facilities Software License Updates and Product Support Software license updates and product support revenues are generated through the sale of software support contracts relating to onpremise new software licenses purchased by our customers Customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period as well as technical support assistance Our software license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration Substantially all of our onpremise software license customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually The growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors 1 the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts 2 the amount of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses and 3 the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired Software license updates and product support revenues which represented 51 49 and 47 of our total revenues in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively is our highest margin business unit Our software support margins during fiscal 2016 were 91 and accounted for 86 of our total margins over the same period Our software license updates and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to software support obligations assumed in business combinations and by the amortization of intangible assets both of which are discussed further below under Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges Over the longer term we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons substantially all of our onpremise new software license customers including customers from acquired companies renew their software support contracts when eligible for renewal substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses resulting in a further increase in our software support contract base Even if new software licenses revenues growth was flat software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming contract renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software licenses transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts which add to our software support contract base and 42 Table of Contents our acquisitions have increased our software support contract base as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported Hardware Business Our hardware business is comprised of two operating segments 1 hardware products and 2 hardware support Our hardware business represented 13 of our total revenues in fiscal 2016 and 14 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2015 and 2014 We expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and onpremise software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services including direct materials and labor costs We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services Hardware Products We provide a broad selection of hardware and related services including Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage networking workstations and related devices industryspecific hardware virtualization software operating systems and management software to support diverse IT environments including cloud computing environments We engineer our hardware products with virtualization and management capabilities to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud and onpremise IT infrastructures Our hardware products support many of the worlds largest cloud infrastructures including the Oracle Cloud Our hardware products are designed to be easier to deploy manage and maintain for our customers and to improve computing performance relative to our competitors offerings We design our hardware products to seamlessly connect cloud and onpremise IT environments to further enable interoperability interchangeability and extendibility and to work in customer environments that may include other Oracle or nonOracle hardware or software components Our flexible and open approach provides Oracle customers with a broad range of choices in how they deploy our hardware products which we believe is a priority for our customers Oracle Engineered Systems are core to our hardware offerings and are important elements of our data center and cloud computing offerings including the Oracle Cloud These preintegrated products are designed to integrate multiple Oracle technology components to work together to deliver improved performance availability security and operational efficiency relative to our competitors products to be upgraded effectively and efficiently and to simplify maintenance cycles by providing a single solution for software patching Oracle Engineered Systems are tested before they are shipped to customers and delivered readytorun enabling customers to shorten deployment time to production We offer certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems technologies through flexible deployment options including as a cloud service and for onpremise IT environments We offer a wide range of server products using our SPARC microprocessor Our SPARC servers run the Oracle Solaris operating system and are designed to be differentiated by their reliability security and scalability Our midsize and large servers are designed to offer better performance and lower total cost of ownership than competitive UNIX systems for business critical applications for customers having more computationally intensive needs and as platforms for building cloud computing IT environments Our SPARC servers are also a core component of the Oracle SuperCluster one of our Oracle Engineered Systems We also offer enterprise x86 servers These x86 servers are based on microprocessors from Intel Corporation and are compatible with Oracle Solaris Oracle Linux Microsoft Windows and other operating systems Our x86 servers are also a core component of many of our Oracle Engineered Systems including the Oracle Exadata Database Machine Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud Oracle Exalytics InMemory Machine and the Oracle Big Data Appliance Our storage products are engineered for the cloud and designed to securely store manage protect archive backup and recover customers mission critical data assets Our storage products consist of disk flash tape virtual tape and hardwarerelated software including file systems software backup and archive software hierarchical storage management software and networking for mainframe and heterogeneous systems environments We also offer certain of our storage offerings as a cloud service 43 Table of Contents Our networking and data center fabric products including Oracle Virtual Networking and Oracle InfiniBand and Ethernet technologies are used with our server and storage products and are integrated into our management tools to help enterprise customers improve infrastructure performance reduce cost and complexity and simplify storage and server connectivity We offer hardware products and services designed for certain specific industries Our pointofsale hardware offerings include pointofsale terminals and related hardware that are designed for managing businesses within the food and beverage hotel and retail industries among others Our hardware products and services for communications networks include network signaling policy control and subscriber data management solutions and session border control technology among others The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and valueadded resellers To produce our hardware products we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as thirdparty manufacturing partners Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement assembly testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage products For all other manufacturing we generally rely on thirdparty manufacturing partners to produce our hardwarerelated components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly testing and quality control processes for these components and products We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities We strive to reduce costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types and a buildtoorder manufacturing process in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders Our hardware products revenues cost of hardware products and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware products the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations In addition our operating margins for our hardware products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets Our quarterly hardware products revenues are difficult to predict The timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions among other factors could substantially affect the amount of hardware products revenues expenses and operating margins that we report Hardware Support Our hardware support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products and can include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Typically our hardware support contract arrangements are priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration We continue to evolve hardware support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new and renewed hardware support contracts sold in connection with the sales of our hardware products Our hardware support revenues that we report are influenced by a number of factors including the volume of purchases of hardware products the pricing and mix of hardware products purchased whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and our acquisitions Substantially all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available Our hardware support margins have been and will be affected by certain of our acquisitions and related accounting including fair value adjustments relating to hardware support obligations assumed and by the amortization of intangible assets both of which are discussed further below under Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges 44 Table of Contents Services Business Our services business which represented 9 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively and 10 of our total revenues in fiscal 2014 is comprised of the remainder of our operating segments Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and onpremise software and hardware businesses Our services revenues are impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services certain of our acquisitions general economic conditions governmental budgetary constraints personnel reductions in our customers IT departments tighter controls over discretionary spending our strategic emphasis on growing our cloud revenues and the growth in our software and hardware offerings Our services business offerings include consulting services that are designed to help our customers and global system integrator partners more successfully architect and deploy our offerings including IT strategy alignment enterprise architecture planning and design initial software implementation and integration and ongoing software enhancements and upgrades We utilize a global blended delivery model to optimize value for our customers and partners consisting of onpremise consultants from local geographies industry specialists and consultants from our global delivery and solution centers advanced customer support services which are provided onpremise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their Oracle products and services and also include certain other services and education services for Oracle products and services including training and certification programs that are offered to customers partners and employees through a variety of formats including instructorled classes at our education centers live virtual training selfpaced online training private events and custom training Acquisitions A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy In recent years we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies products services and technologies including MICROS Systems Inc MICROS in fiscal 2015 We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers expands our customer base provides greater scale to accelerate innovation grows our revenues and earnings and increases stockholder value We expect to continue to acquire companies products services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings operating margin cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission GAAP as set forth within the ASC requires us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent that there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our financial statements will be affected The accounting policies that reflect our 45 Table of Contents more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include Revenue Recognition Business Combinations Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments Accounting for Income Taxes and Legal and Other Contingencies In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include cloud and onpremise software revenues which include the sale of new software licenses which generally grant to customers a perpetual right to use our database middleware applications and industryspecific software products cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings which grant customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure standardsbased cloud computing environment cloud IaaS offerings which grant customers access to infrastructure cloud services to perform elastic compute storage and networking services and also provide management services for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure both generally on a subscription basis and software license updates and product support offerings described further below hardware revenues which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems computer servers storage products networking and data center fabric products and industryspecific hardware and hardware support revenues described further below and services revenues which are earned from providing software and hardware related services including consulting advanced customer support and education services Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services Software Elements New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database middleware application and industryspecific software products and exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates which are included in software license updates and product support revenues The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985605 SoftwareRevenue Recognition We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize new software licenses revenues when 1 we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software 2 we deliver the products 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties and 4 collection is probable Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met 46 Table of Contents Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions However if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy for example in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are shortterm in nature we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example acceptance provisions that are longterm in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts which are entered into at the customers option and the related fees are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement typically one year Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsSoftware Products and Software Related Services Software Arrangements We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as software related multipleelement arrangements Such software related multipleelement arrangements include the sale of our software products software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements For those software related multipleelement arrangements we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985605 Under the residual method if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multipleelement arrangement such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multipleelement arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendorspecific objective evidence VSOEdescribed further below with any remaining amount allocated to the software license Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS Offerings Hardware Products Hardware Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Elements Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables including cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware products support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 60525 Revenue Recognition MultipleElement Arrangements and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues hardware products revenues support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met When applicable we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example acceptance provisions that are longterm in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 47 Table of Contents Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloudbased IT environment that we manage host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Our cloud IaaS offerings provide infrastructure cloud services and also include deployment and management offerings for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure Our cloud IaaS offerings are generally sold on a subscription basis and revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems computer servers storage networking and industryspecific hardware and are recognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements which is typically one year provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsCloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS Offerings Hardware Products Hardware Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Arrangements We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements Each element within a nonsoftware multipleelement arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer Further our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement or in the case of our cloud offerings we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements For our nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy VSOE if available thirdparty evidence TPE if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available a description as to how we determine VSOE TPE and ESP is provided below If a tangible hardware product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the products essential functionality and if so the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions 48 Table of Contents When possible we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support based on the renewal rates offered to customers TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including but not limited to pricing practices including discounting margin objectives competition contractually stated prices the geographies in which we offer our products and services the type of customer ie distributor valueadded reseller government agency and direct end user among others and the stage of the product lifecycle The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management taking into consideration our pricing model and gotomarket strategy As our or our competitors pricing and gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE TPE and ESP As a result our future revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsArrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multipleelement arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including new software licenses software license updates and product support cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware products hardware support consulting advanced customer support services and education In such arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985605 and our policies as described above After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985605 The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of services from other vendors timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed When total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 49 Table of Contents Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and nonsoftware products and services We offer these advanced support services both onpremise and remote to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services Depending upon the nature of the arrangement revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period which is generally one year or less Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructorled mediabased and internetbased training in the use of our software and hardware products Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions then new software licenses revenues andor hardware products revenues including the costs of hardware products are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions when such provisions are required by law to determine the probability of possible cancellation We consider multiple factors including the history with the customer in similar transactions the essential use of the software or hardware products and the planning budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met If such a determination cannot be made revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met Our standard payment terms are net 30 days However payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed We evaluate nonstandard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements based upon similarity of customers products and license economics and if so generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include shortterm payment terms we have a standard practice of providing longterm financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division Since fiscal 1989 when our financing division was formed we have established a history of collection without concessions on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery net of any payment discounts from financing transactions We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a nonrecourse basis to thirdparty financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows We account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies Concurrent Transactions Software license agreements sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a threemonth time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure When we acquire goods or services from a customer we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction at terms we consider to be at arms length and settle the purchase in cash We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations 50 Table of Contents Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations in accounting for our acquisitions It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets contractual obligations assumed preacquisition contingencies and contingent consideration where applicable Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS contracts hardware product sales support agreements consulting contracts other customer contracts acquired developed technologies and patents expected costs to develop the inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed the acquired companys brand and competitive position as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio and discount rates Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results We estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS and PaaS software license updates and product support and hardware support obligations assumed The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost buildup approach The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition As a result of our fair value estimates for these obligations we did not recognize certain cloud SaaS and PaaS software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for further discussion Historically substantially all of our customers including customers from acquired companies renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware support contracts To the extent 51 Table of Contents customers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective contracts renewal periods In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management but may be refined in subsequent periods We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities assumptions are applied regarding estimated sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made For a given acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a preacquisition contingency nonincome tax related by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 IntangiblesGoodwill and Other According to ASC 350 we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the twostep impairment test Based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 will be performed In the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 52 Table of Contents but that are inherently uncertain Actual future results may differ from those estimates In addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed on March 1 2016 did not result in a goodwill impairment charge nor did we recognize an impairment charge in fiscal 2014 In fiscal 2015 we recognized an impairment charge of 186 million in our hardware products reporting unit refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information Other than our consulting reporting unit all of our other reporting units had fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values based on our most recent annual goodwill impairment review Our consulting reporting unit had 18 billion of goodwill on March 1 2016 and experienced revenue and operating margin declines in fiscal 2016 As of our most recent annual goodwill impairment review our consulting reporting units fair value was 11 in excess of its carrying value We estimate that should our consulting reporting units projected margins and related cash flows unfavorably deviate from our projections by 20 or more each year our consulting reporting unit likely would incur a goodwill impairment loss We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate We review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value If the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective They can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision In the ordinary course of a global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no US taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations Based on these assumptions we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide US federal taxes on these amounts Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate 53 Table of Contents We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located We consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known which can materially impact our effective tax rate The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740 Income Taxes which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit judicial rulings and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties In addition as a part of our accounting for business combinations intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure however deferred taxes have been recorded for nondeductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable Because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made As 54 Table of Contents additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was impacted by our recent acquisitions In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the oneyear period subsequent to the acquisition date to the growth in certain of our operating segments revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations When material we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services Expenses for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations andor were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented We caution readers that while pre and postacquisition comparisons as well as any quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies including our sales force integration efforts We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated the relative mix of products and services sold would have been different and although substantially all of our onpremise software license customers including customers from acquired companies renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS and PaaS contracts and hardware support contracts the amounts shown as cloud SaaS and PaaS deferred revenues software license updates and product support deferred revenues and hardware support deferred revenues in our Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges presented below are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our segments revenues and expenses As a result each segments revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the US Dollar against major international currencies In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure To present this information current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US Dollars are converted into US Dollars at constant exchange rates ie the rates in effect on May 31 2015 which was the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods For example if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 10 million Euros from products sold on May 31 2016 and 2015 our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of 112 million in fiscal 2016 using 112 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period and 108 million in fiscal 2015 using 108 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period The constant currency presentation however would translate the fiscal 2016 results using the fiscal 2015 exchange rate and indicate in this example no change in revenues during the period In each of the tables below we present the percent change based on actual unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency 55 Table of Contents Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31 Percent Change

Asia Pacific region includes Japan Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were significantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the US Dollar which decreased our total revenues by 5 percentage points total operating expenses by 4 percentage points and total operating margin by 7 percentage points Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations our total revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to constant currency growth in our cloud and onpremise software business revenues and services business revenues The constant currency growth in our cloud and onpremise software business revenues during fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues growth in our SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions and was partially offset by fiscal 2016 decreases in our new software licenses revenues The constant currency growth in our services business revenues was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions These constant currency increases in our revenues during fiscal 2016 were partially offset by constant currency decreases in our hardware business revenues In constant currency the EMEA region and the Asia Pacific region contributed approximately equal amounts to our fiscal 2016 total revenues growth and the Americas was flat Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased sales and marketing and research and development expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount increased cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues higher restructuring expenses that were recorded pursuant to the Fiscal 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan 2015 Restructuring Plan see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and higher general and administrative expenses due to higher headcount and higher professional services fees primarily legal related fees These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2016 reductions in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized during fiscal 2016 and lower acquisition related and other expenses which primarily was attributable to higher expenses during fiscal 2015 as a result of a goodwill impairment loss of 186 million see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information 56 Table of Contents Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 as our total expenses increased at a faster

We also recorded an acquisition related benefit of 19 million and a litigation related benefit of 53 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively which reduced our expenses in those periods Restructuring Expenses Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure andor operations often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and may also include charges for duplicate facilities and other contract

2014 which also contributed to additional interest expense during fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015 These increases in interest expense during fiscal 2016 were partially offset by reductions in interest expense resulting from the maturity and repayment of 20 billion of senior notes in January 2016 Interest expense was also reduced in fiscal 2016 by the maturity and repayment of 15 billion of

income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the US federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations state taxes the US research and development tax credit settlements with tax authorities and the US domestic production activity deduction Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates by unfavorable changes

taxes in fiscal 2015 due in substantial part to lower net income before provision for income taxes during fiscal 2016 settlements with certain tax authorities and the retroactive extension of the US

Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2015 increased relative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2014 due in substantial part to an unfavorable change in the jurisdictional mix of our fiscal

and marketable securities 56125 3 54368 40 38819 Working capital The decrease in working capital as of May 31 2016 in comparison to May 31 2015 was primarily due to 104 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock 25 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and 12 billion of cash used for capital expenditures These unfavorable working capital movements were partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2016 and cash proceeds from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises The increase in working capital as of May 31 2015 in comparison to May 31 2014 was primarily due to our issuance of 200 billion of longterm senior notes during fiscal 2015 the favorable impact to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2015 and to a lesser extent cash proceeds from stock option exercises These working capital increases were partially offset by 62 billion of net cash used for our acquisitions of MICROS and others 81 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock the reclassification of 20 billion of senior notes that were due in January 2016 from longterm to current and 23 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders all of which occurred during fiscal 2015 Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods the amounts and timing of which are variable 70 Table of Contents Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks Tier1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less Marketable securities consist of Tier1 commercial paper debt securities corporate debt securities and certain other securities The increase in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31 2016 in comparison to May 31 2015 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our operations during fiscal 2016 18 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2016 debt issuances net of debt repayments and cash inflows from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises These fiscal 2016 cash inflows were partially offset by fiscal 2016 cash outflows of 104 billion for repurchases of our common stock 25 billion for the fiscal 2016 payment of cash dividends to our stockholders and 12 billion for fiscal 2016 capital expenditures Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities included 482 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of May 31 2016 We consider 426 billion of our undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations outside the United States These undistributed earnings would be subject to US income tax if repatriated to the United States Assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately 133 billion as of May 31 2016 should the amounts be repatriated to the United States The amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report As the US Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2016 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in US Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31 2016 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31 2015 balance sheet date The increase in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31 2015 in comparison to May 31 2014 was due to an increase in cash generated from our fiscal 2015 operating activities our issuance of 200 billion of senior notes in fiscal 2015 and to a lesser extent cash proceeds from fiscal 2015 stock option exercises These fiscal 2015 cash inflows were partially offset by fiscal 2015 cash outflows of 62 billion of net cash paid for our acquisitions of MICROS and others 81 billion of fiscal 2015 repurchases of our common stock the repayment of 15 billion of senior notes and 23 billion used for the payment of fiscal 2015 cash dividends to our stockholders Additionally our reported cash cash equivalents and marketable securities

operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts terms which are generally one year in length Over the course of a fiscal year we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new software licenses cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings hardware products hardware support arrangements and services Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products taxes and leased facilities 71 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 primarily due to the cash unfavorable effects of lower net income and the related unfavorable currency rate fluctuations on our net income in each fiscal year relative to the corresponding prior year period Cash flows from investing activities The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions the timing of our purchases maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets including certain intangible assets to support our growth Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net cash used to purchase marketable securities net of proceeds received from sales and maturities and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions net of cash acquired Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2015 relative to fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions net of cash acquired and an increase in net cash used to purchase marketable securities net of proceeds received from sales and maturities Cash flows from financing activities The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 We used net cash for financing activities of 99 billion during fiscal 2016 in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities of 99 billion during fiscal 2015 Cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2016 was primarily due to cash outflows of 104 billion for fiscal 2016 common stock repurchases and 25 billion for fiscal 2016 dividend payments partially offset by 18 billion of cash inflows from fiscal 2016 debt issuances net of repayments Cash provided by financing activities of 99 billion during fiscal 2015 was primarily due to 183 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2015 debt issuances net of repayments partially offset by 81 billion of cash used for fiscal 2015 common stock repurchases and 23 billion of cash used for fiscal 2015 dividend payments Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014 Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 increased in comparison to net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2014 primarily due to a net increase in borrowings in fiscal 2015 as well as lower stock repurchase activity during fiscal 2015 These favorable impacts to our financing cash flows during fiscal 2015 were partially offset by the repayment of 15 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities during fiscal 2015 no repayments during fiscal 2014 Free cash flow To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis we use nonGAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations We believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors The presentation of nonGAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity We calculate free cash flow as follows Year Ended May 31 Dollars in millions 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities 13561

LongTerm Customer Financing We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products hardware products and services offerings through separate longterm payment contracts We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a nonrecourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables We financed 12

revenues Recent Financing Activities Revolving Credit Agreement In May 2016 we entered into three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank NA as initial lender and administrative agent the 2016 Credit Agreements and borrowed 38 billion pursuant to these agreements The 2016 Credit Agreements provided us with shortterm borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes Interest for the 2016 Credit Agreements is based on either 1 a LIBORbased formula or 2 the Base Rate formula each as set forth in the 2016 Credit Agreements The borrowings are due and payable on June

program We repurchased 2719 million shares for 104 billion 1937 million shares for 81 billion and 2804 million shares for 98 billion in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments our debt repayment obligations described further below or repurchases of our debt our stock price and economic and market conditions Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time

outstanding as of May 31 2016 after considering certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBORbased index Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and are subject to change in future periods interest payments on our floatingrate senior notes that are based upon the interest

interest payments for our other Eurodenominated senior notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were estimated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May 31 2016 and are subject to change in future periods Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our notes payable and other

balance sheet at May 31 2016 Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the payment We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture subassemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon leadtimes andor commercially standard leadtimes for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way In June 2016 we acquired certain companies to expand our cloud industry solutions offerings These acquisitions were not individually significant In the aggregate the estimated total preliminary purchase price was 13 billion As of May 31 2016 we had 53 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits including related interest and penalties recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2017 74 Table of Contents We believe that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements In addition we believe that we could fund any future acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities OffBalance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors including the structure of sales force incentive compensation plans In addition our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer These seasonal factors are common in the technology industry These factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year Similarly the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues in particular our cloud software and onpremise software segment as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2017 The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters We believe that all necessary adjustments which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated

certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders 75 Table of Contents We recognize that restricted stockbased awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stockbased awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages Consistent with these dual goals our cumulative potential dilution since June 1 2013 has been a weightedaverage annualized rate of 16 per year The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stockbased awards or stock options granted and assumed net of restricted stockbased awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company divided by the weightedaverage outstanding shares during the calculation period This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stockbased awards vest and stock options are exercised Of the outstanding stock options at May 31 2016 which generally have a tenyear exercise period 133 have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date In recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stockbased compensation program however we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions to pay dividends to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes At May 31 2016 the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stockbased awards and unexercised stock options regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date was 103 The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors

fiscal fourth quarter earnings report 76 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investmentgrade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investmentgrade ratings criteria which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks In addition as of May 31 2016 substantially all of our marketable securities are high quality with approximately 28 having maturity dates within one year and 72 having maturity dates within one to six years a description of our marketable securities held is included in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and Liquidity and Capital Resources above We hold a mix of both fixed and floatingrate debt securities The fair values of our fixedrate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of May 31 2016 we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by 282 million Our floatingrate debt securities serve to lower the overall risk to our investments portfolio associated with the risk of rising interest rates Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as availableforsale We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities For fiscal 2016 total interest income was 538 million with our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 116 on a worldwide basis The table below presents the approximate fair values of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the related weightedaverage interest rates for our investment portfolio at May 31 2016 and 2015 May 31 2016 2015 Dollars in millions

consisting of 378 billion of fixedrate borrowings 23 billion of floatingrate borrowings FloatingRate Notes and 38 billion of shortterm borrowings under a revolving credit agreement ShortTerm Borrowings 77 Table of Contents We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our 15 billion of 2375 senior notes due January 2019 January 2019 Notes our 20 billion of 225 senior notes due October 2019 October 2019 Notes and our 15 billion of 280 senior notes due July 2021 July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the January 2019 Notes October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to including the notional amounts and maturity dates We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixedrate borrowings for trading purposes We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 The total fair value gain of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31 2016 was 122 million If LIBORbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31 2016 the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by 185 million Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report By issuing the FloatingRate Notes and the ShortTerm Borrowings and by entering into the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR As of May 31 2016 the weightedaverage interest rate associated with our FloatingRate Notes ShortTerm Borrowings and January 2019 Notes October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements was 114 Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates As of May 31 2016 if LIBORbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately 76 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floatingrate borrowings Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations Given the short duration of the forward contracts amounts recorded generally are not significant The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is nonoperating income expense net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses 78 Table of Contents We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors As of May 31 2016 and 2015 the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 27 billion and 22 billion respectively As of May 31 2016 and 2015 the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 20 billion and 12 billion respectively The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31 2016 and 2015 Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in nonoperating income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were 110 million 157 million and 375 million in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 were foreign currency remeasurement losses relating to our Venezuelan subsidiarys operations of 7 million 23 million and 213 million respectively see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future the amounts and timing of which are unknown Foreign Currency Translation RiskImpact on Cash Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into US Dollars In particular the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report As the US Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2016 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in US Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31 2016 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of May 31 2015 As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in US Dollars for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 were decreases of 115 million 12 billion and 158 million respectively The following table includes estimates of the US Dollar equivalent of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies that we held as of May 31 2016 in millions US Dollar Equivalent at May 31 2016 Euro 2430 Japanese Yen 618 Indian Rupee 493 Chinese Renminbi 442 Canadian Dollar 369 British Pound 262 Swiss Franc 191 Australian Dollar 184 Other foreign currencies 1806 Total cash cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies 6795 If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the US Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in US Dollars would have decreased by approximately 680 million assuming constant foreign currency cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 79 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Translation Risk Net Investment Hedge In July 2013 we issued 750 million of 3125 senior notes due July 2025 July 2025 Notes We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the US Dollar As a result provided there is no ineffectiveness related to the hedge the change in the carrying value of the Eurodenominated July 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled 25 million of net other comprehensive losses for fiscal 2016 Any remaining change in the carrying value of the July 2025 Notes representing any ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in nonoperating income expense net We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2016 Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the US Dollar will impact the amount of US Dollars that we will require to settle the July 2025 Notes at maturity If the US Dollar would have been weaker by 10 in comparison to the Euro as of May 31 2016 we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal portion of the July 2025 Notes in US Dollars would have increased by approximately 84 million Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The response to this item is submitted as a separate section of this Annual Report See Part IV Item 15 Item 9 Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None Item 9A Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10K we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a15e and 15d15e Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Exchange Act such as this Annual Report on Form 10K is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the US Securities and Exchange Commission Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure Our quarterly evaluation of disclosure controls includes an evaluation of some components of our internal control over financial reporting We also perform a separate annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the management report below The evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design our implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this Annual Report on Form 10K In the course of the controls evaluation we reviewed data errors or control problems identified and sought to confirm that appropriate corrective actions including process improvements were being undertaken This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10Q and Form 10K Many of the components of our disclosure controls are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by both our internal audit and finance organizations The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic processes and procedures that we adjust as circumstances merit 80 Table of Contents Based on our managements evaluation with the participation of our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report our Principal Executive Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a15f and 15d15f Under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2016 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commissions 2013 framework Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP Based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31 2016 We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2016 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of Exchange Act Rules 13a15 or 15d15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level However our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud A control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met Further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake Additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate Because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected Item 9B Other Information None 81 Table of Contents PART III Item 10 Directors Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Pursuant to General Instruction

infrastructure technologies including consulting services advanced customer support services and education services Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977 Basis of Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracles stockholders for all periods presented The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have been included as a component of nonoperating income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated Certain other prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues operating income or net income Included in acquisition related and other expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2016 and 2015 are an acquisition related benefit of 19 million and a litigation related benefit of 53 million respectively Further acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 included 186 million related to a goodwill impairment loss refer to Note 7 below for additional information In fiscal 2016 we adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 201517 Income Taxes Topic 740 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ASU 201517 on a retrospective basis As required by ASU 201517 all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheets which is a change from our historical presentation whereby certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified as current and the remainder were classified as noncurrent Upon adoption of ASU 201517 current deferred tax assets of 663 million and current deferred tax liabilities of 85 million in our May 31 2015 consolidated balance sheet were reclassified as noncurrent and certain related reclassification entries were also recorded In addition in fiscal 2016 we also adopted the following

consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent that there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include cloud and onpremise software revenues which include the sale of new software licenses which generally grant to customers a perpetual right to use our database middleware applications and industryspecific software products cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings which grant customers access to a broad range of our software and related support offerings on a subscription basis in a secure standardsbased cloud computing environment cloud IaaS offerings which grant customers access to infrastructure cloud services to perform elastic compute storage and networking services and also provide management services for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure both generally on a subscription basis and software license updates and product support offerings described further below hardware revenues which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems computer servers storage products networking and data center fabric products and industryspecific hardware and hardware support revenues described further below and services revenues which are earned from providing software and hardware related services including consulting advanced customer support and education services Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities 92 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2016 Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services Software Elements New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database middleware application and industryspecific software products and exclude cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates which are included in software license updates and product support revenues The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985605 SoftwareRevenue Recognition We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize new software licenses revenues when 1 we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software 2 we deliver the products 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties and 4 collection is probable Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions However if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy for example in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are shortterm in nature we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example acceptance provisions that are longterm in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts which are entered into at the customers option and the related fees are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement typically one year Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsSoftware Products and Software Related Services Software Arrangements We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and software related services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as software related multipleelement arrangements Such software related multipleelement arrangements include the sale of our software products software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements For those software related multipleelement arrangements we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985605 Under the residual method if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multipleelement arrangement such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multipleelement arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendorspecific objective evidence VSOEdescribed further below with any remaining amount allocated to the software license 93 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2016 Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS Offerings Hardware Products Hardware Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Elements Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables including cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware products support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 60525 Revenue Recognition MultipleElement Arrangements and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues hardware products revenues support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met When applicable we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items Where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example acceptance provisions that are longterm in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period Our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloudbased IT environment that we manage host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis Revenues for our cloud SaaS and PaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Our cloud IaaS offerings provide infrastructure cloud services and also include deployment and management offerings for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure Our cloud IaaS offerings are generally sold on a subscription basis and revenues for these cloud IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems computer servers storage networking and industryspecific hardware and are recognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements which is typically one year provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsCloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS Offerings Hardware Products Hardware Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Arrangements We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements Each element within a nonsoftware multipleelement arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer Further our revenue 94 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2016 arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement or in the case of our cloud offerings we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements For our nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy VSOE if available thirdparty evidence TPE if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available a description as to how we determine VSOE TPE and ESP is provided below If a tangible hardware product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the products essential functionality and if so the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions When possible we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support based on the renewal rates offered to customers TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including but not limited to pricing practices including discounting margin objectives competition contractually stated prices the geographies in which we offer our products and services the type of customer ie distributor valueadded reseller government agency and direct end user among others and the stage of the product lifecycle The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management taking into consideration our pricing model and gotomarket strategy As our or our competitors pricing and gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE TPE and ESP As a result our future revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsArrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multipleelement arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including new software licenses software license updates and product support cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware products hardware support consulting advanced customer support services and education In such arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and 95 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2016 to the nonsoftware elements We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985605 and our policies as described above After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985605 The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of services from other vendors timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed When total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and nonsoftware products and services We offer these advanced support services both onpremise and remote to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services Depending upon the nature of the arrangement revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period which is generally one year or less Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructorled mediabased and internetbased training in the use of our software and hardware products Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions then new software licenses revenues andor hardware products revenues including the costs of hardware products are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such elements We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions when such provisions are required by law to determine the probability of possible cancellation We consider multiple factors including the history with the customer in similar transactions the essential use of the software or hardware products and the planning budgeting and approval processes 96 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2016 undertaken by the governmental entity If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met If such a determination cannot be made revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met Our standard payment terms are net 30 days However payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed We evaluate nonstandard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements based upon similarity of customers products and license economics and if so generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include shortterm payment terms we have a standard practice of providing longterm financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division Since fiscal 1989 when our financing division was formed we have established a history of collection without concessions on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery net of any payment discounts from financing transactions We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a nonrecourse basis to thirdparty financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows We account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables We sold 18 billion of our financing receivables to financial institutions during each of fiscal 2016 and 2015 and 20 billion during fiscal 2014 Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies Concurrent Transactions Software license agreements sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a threemonth time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure When we acquire goods or services from a customer we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction at terms we consider to be at arms length and settle the purchase in cash We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations in accounting for our acquisitions It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 97 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2016 Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations and are accounted for separately from the business combination A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities assumptions are applied regarding estimated sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made For a given acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a preacquisition contingency nonincome tax related by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Marketable and NonMarketable Securities In accordance with ASC 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities and based on our intentions regarding these instruments we classify substantially all of our marketable debt and equity securities as availableforsale Marketable debt and equity securities classified as availableforsale are reported at fair value with all unrealized gains losses reflected net of tax in stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets and as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income If we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value we recognize the investment loss in nonoperating income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required Substantially all of our marketable debt and equity investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations We hold investments in certain nonmarketable equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence These equity securities are recorded at cost and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets If based on the terms of our ownership of these nonmarketable securities we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these nonmarketable securities relate we apply the requirements of ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures to account for such investments Our nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews Fair Values of Financial Instruments We apply the provisions of ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4 98 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2016 Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices For those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends We writeoff a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and trade receivables Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investmentgrade securities Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 We outsource the design manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the United States Further we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of thirdparty manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these thirdparty manufacturers build our hardware products Any inability of these thirdparty manufacturing partners to fulfill orders for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons generally six to nine months Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware products expenses In addition we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete At the point of loss recognition a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Other Receivables Other receivables represent valueadded tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled 816 million and 817 million at May 31 2016 and 2015 respectively Deferred Sales Commissions We defer sales commission expenses associated with our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings and recognize the related expenses over the noncancelable term of the related contracts which are typically one to three years Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 99 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2016 Property Plant and Equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value net of accumulated depreciation Depreciation is computed using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives of the assets which range from one to 40 years Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms as appropriate Property plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 Goodwill Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives which generally range from one to 10 years Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable According to ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the twostep impairment test Based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test will be performed In the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference We did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2016 or 2014 During fiscal 2015 we recognized a 186 million goodwill impairment loss refer to Note 7 below for additional information Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value If the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 Derivative Financial Instruments During fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 we used derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks see Note 11 below for additional information We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met ie the instruments are accounted for as hedges 100 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2016 The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change The loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings with an offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge each reporting period we record the change in fair value on the effective portion of the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk being hedged For the nonderivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge for our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries the change on account of remeasurement of the effective portion for each reporting period is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets We perform the effectiveness testing of our aforementioned designated hedges on a quarterly basis and the changes in ineffective portions of the derivatives if any are recognized immediately in earnings Legal Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For legal

recognize for each PSU tranche on a cumulative basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered and may cause the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary For our servicebased awards we recognize stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures on a straightline basis over the service period of the award which is generally four years We record deferred tax assets for stockbased compensation awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized and the fair value attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax

recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized A twostep approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated

guidance under GAAP The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services Topic 606 defines a fivestep process to achieve this core principle and in doing so it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation among others Topic 606 is effective for us as of either our first quarter of fiscal 2018 or our first quarter of fiscal 2019 using either of two methods 1 retrospective application of Topic 606 to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined

value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value An assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities or Level 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis excluding accrued interest components consisted

identified provided that any such change is within the measurement period up to one year from the date of the acquisition During fiscal 2015 we recorded a 186 million goodwill impairment loss to our hardware products reporting unit We considered several approaches to determine the fair value of our hardware products reporting unit as of March 1 2015 and concluded the most appropriate to be the income approach The fair value of our hardware products reporting unit pursuant to the income approach was impacted by lower forecasted operating results for this reporting unit primarily caused by lower forecasted revenues and our continued investment in hardware products research and development activities We compared the implied fair value of goodwill in our hardware products reporting unit to its carrying value which resulted in the 186 million goodwill impairment loss and represented the aggregate amount of goodwill for our hardware products reporting unit The aggregate hardware products reporting unit goodwill that was impaired in fiscal 2015 resulted from our acquisitions of Pillar Data Systems Inc Xsigo Systems Inc GreenBytes Inc and MICROS Systems Inc Such impairment loss

IaaS revenues generally resulted from customer payments made in advance for our cloudbased offerings that are recognized over the corresponding contractual term Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed Deferred new software licenses revenues typically resulted from undelivered products or specified enhancements customerspecific acceptance provisions customer payments made in advance for timebased license arrangements and software license transactions that cannot be separated from undelivered consulting or other services In connection with our acquisitions we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS and PaaS software license updates and product support and hardware support obligations among others assumed from our acquired companies We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost buildup approach The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud SaaS and PaaS software license updates and product support and hardware support deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the postcombination periods 115 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2016 11 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value HedgesInterest Rate Swap Agreements In July 2014 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR In July 2013 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our January 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the October 2019 Notes July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to including the notional amounts and maturity dates We have designated the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixedrate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets The amount of net gain loss attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable noncurrent The periodic interest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for the October 2019 Notes July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities In July 2014 we settled the fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements associated with the July 2014 Notes We do not use any interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes Cash Flow HedgesCrossCurrency Swap Agreements In connection with the issuance of our January 2021 Notes we entered into certain crosscurrency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixedrate Eurodenominated January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to fixedrate US Dollardenominated debt The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in US Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at 16 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 353 We have designated these crosscurrency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815 The critical terms of the crosscurrency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments being hedged and the crosscurrency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes We used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our crosscurrency swap agreements The fair values of these crosscurrency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these crosscurrency swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into nonoperating income expense net in the same period that the carrying value of the Eurodenominated January 2021 Notes is remeasured and the interest expense is recognized The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these crosscurrency swaps if any is recorded immediately to nonoperating income expense net We evaluate the effectiveness of our crosscurrency swap agreements on a quarterly basis We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 The cash flows related to the crosscurrency swap agreements that 116 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2016 pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities We do not use any crosscurrency swap agreements for trading purposes Net Investment HedgeForeign Currency Borrowings In July 2013 we designated our July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the US Dollar We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedge Under this method for each reporting period the change in the carrying value of the Eurodenominated July 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion if any is recognized in nonoperating income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the beginning of every quarter We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is nonoperating income expense net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses As of May 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 27 billion and 22 billion respectively and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 20 billion and 12 billion respectively The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31 2016 and 2015 Included in our nonoperating income expense net were 97 million 60 million and 69 million of net gains losses related to these forward contracts for the years ended May 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities 117

certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers which are agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the payment We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture subassemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon leadtimes andor commercially standard leadtimes for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts below Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and

restricted stockbased awards that are solely subject to servicebased vesting requirements based upon their intrinsic values as of the grant dates The fair values of our PSUs were also measured based upon their intrinsic values as of their respective grant dates The vesting conditions and related terms of our PSUs were communicated to each participating employee as of their respective grant dates and included attainment metrics that were defined fixed and based upon consistent US GAAP metrics or internal metrics that are defined fixed and consistently determined and that require the employee to render service Therefore these awards met the performancebased award classification criteria as defined within ASC 718 We estimated the fair values of our stock options using the BlackScholesMerton optionpricing model which was developed for use in estimating the fair values of stock options Option valuation models including the BlackScholesMerton optionpricing model require the input of assumptions including stock price volatility Changes in the input assumptions can affect the fair value estimates and ultimately how much we recognize as stockbased compensation expense The fair values of our stock options were estimated at the grant dates or at the acquisition dates for options assumed in a business combination The weightedaverage input assumptions used and resulting fair

primarily to transfer pricing Other issues are related to years with expiring statutes of limitation With some exceptions we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in nonUS jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997 We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits However there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof On July 27 2015 in Altera Corp v Commissioner the US Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement A final decision has yet to be issued by the US Tax Court due to other outstanding issues related to the case At this time the US Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stockbased compensation from its regulations We have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries including in particular India Brazil and Korea where the amounts under controversy are significant In some although not all cases we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary If our estimates of the federal state and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment it would result in a further charge to expense 16 SEGMENT INFORMATION ASC 280 Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information about

HewlettPackard Company Litigation On June 15 2011 HewlettPackard Company HP filed a complaint in the California Superior Court County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing defamation intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act The original plaintiff Hewlett Packard Company is now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HPs Itaniumbased servers it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd the Hurd Settlement Agreement who was both HPs former chief executive officer and chairman of HPs board of directors HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief Oracle answered the complaint and filed a crosscomplaint which was amended on December 2 2011 The amended crosscomplaint alleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor and had misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap among other claims Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief The court bifurcated the trial and tried HPs causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012 The court issued a final statement of decision on August 28 2012 finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HPs Itaniumbased servers and to port such products at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers Oracle has announced that it is appealing this decision The issues of breach HPs performance causation and damages HPs tort claims and Oracles crossclaims will all be tried before a jury As of April 8 2013 the trial was stayed pending Oracles appeal of the courts denial of its antiSLAPP motion On August 27 2015 the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial courts denial of Oracles antiSLAPP motion The Court of Appeals decision became final on September 26 2015 The matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings and trial which began on May 23 2016 While we believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action and we will continue to vigorously defend it we cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process and the nature of the claims State of Oregon Litigation On August 22 2014 the Attorney General for the State of Oregon the State of Oregon and the Oregon Health Insurance Exchange Corporation doing business as Cover Oregon Cover Oregon filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Marion against Oracle our thenPresident

dealing and breach of impliedinfact contract Oracle seeks monetary damages to compensate it for the value of unpaid services and its attorneys fees and costs Trial is set to begin on January 10 2017
