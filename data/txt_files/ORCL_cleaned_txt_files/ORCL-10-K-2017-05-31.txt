software lifecycle management to enable the rapid delivery of the latest cloud technology capabilities as they become available Manufacturing To produce our hardware products that we market and sell to thirdparty customers and that we utilize internally to deliver as a part of our Oracle Cloud operations we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as thirdparty manufacturing partners Our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of materials procurement assembly testing and quality control of our Oracle Engineered Systems and certain of our enterprise and data center servers and storage products For all other manufacturing we generally rely on thirdparty manufacturing partners to produce our hardwarerelated components and hardware products and we may involve our internal manufacturing operations in the final assembly testing and quality control processes for these components and products We distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities Our manufacturing processes are substantially based on standardization of components across product types centralization of assembly and distribution centers and a buildtoorder methodology in which products generally are built only after customers have placed firm orders Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials supplies product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of vendors For most of our hardware products we have existing alternate sources of supply or such sources are readily available However we do rely on sole sources for certain of our hardware products As a result we continue to evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations Refer to Risk Factors included in Item 1A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our products and the related risks to our business Sales and Marketing We directly market and sell our cloud and onpremise software hardware and services offerings to businesses of many sizes and in many industries government agencies and educational institutions We also market and sell our offerings through indirect channels No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2017 2016 or 2015 18 Table of Contents In the United States our sales and services employees are based in our headquarters and in field offices throughout the country Outside the United States our international subsidiaries sell support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales subsidiary Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings Our international operations subject us to certain risks which are more fully described in Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this Annual Report A summary of our domestic and international revenues and longlived assets is set forth in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report We also market our product offerings worldwide through indirect channels The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network The Oracle Partner Network is a global program that manages our business relationships with a large broadbased network of companies including independent software and hardware vendors system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon our product offerings By offering our partners access to our product offerings educational information technical services marketing and sales support the Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and valueadded resellers Research and Development We develop the substantial majority of our product offerings internally In addition we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology While we believe that our patents have value no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal businesses Research and development expenditures were 62 billion 58 billion and 55 billion in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively or 16 16 and 14 of total revenues in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions offerings and enhancements characterize the cloud and onpremise software and hardware markets in which we compete We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product and services offerings Employees As of May 31 2017 we employed approximately 138000 fulltime employees including approximately 39000 in sales and marketing approximately 8000 in our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS operations approximately 9000 in software license updates and product support approximately 5000 in hardware approximately 24000 in services approximately 40000 in research and development and approximately 13000 in general and administrative positions Of these employees approximately 51000 were employed in the United States and approximately 87000 were employed internationally None of our employees in the United States is represented by a labor union however in certain foreign subsidiaries labor unions or workers councils represent some of our employees Seasonality and Cyclicality Our quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans which are common in the technology industry In each fiscal year our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter The operating margins of our businesses in particular our cloud and onpremise software business and hardware business are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term See Selected Quarterly Financial Data 19 Table of Contents in Item 7 of this Annual Report for a more complete description of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues expenses and margins Competition We face intense competition in all aspects of our business The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge expand or are acquired as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change Our customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation sourcing integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software and hardware Our enterprise cloud and onpremise software and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world including Amazoncom Inc Microsoft Corporation Microsoft International Business Machines Corporation IBM Intel and SAP SE and as well as other companies like HewlettPackard Enterprise salesforcecom inc and Workday Inc In addition due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions or offerings focused on a specific functionality product area or industry In addition as we expand into new market segments we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed Moreover we or our competitors may take certain strategic actionsincluding acquisitions partnerships and joint ventures or repositioning of product lineswhich invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include total cost of ownership performance scalability reliability security functionality efficiency speed to production and quality of technical support Our product and service sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following among other things the adoption of cloudbased IT offerings including SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings ease of deployment use and maintenance of our products and services offerings compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within onpremise IT environments and public cloud IT environments including our Oracle Cloud environments the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors the broader platform competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the NET programming environment of Microsoft operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems with alternatives including Microsofts Windows Server and other UNIX and Linux operating systems the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers products features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff products features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants systems integrators or other third parties and attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers For more information about the competitive risks we face refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report Available Information Our Annual Report on Form 10K

Andersen LLP most recently as a partner Item 1A Risk Factors We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict The following discussion as well as our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 highlights some of these risks The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities Our Oracle Cloud strategy including our Oracle Software as a Service SaaS Platform as a Service PaaS Infrastructure as a Service IaaS and Data as a Service DaaS offerings may adversely affect our revenues and profitability We provide our cloud and onpremise offerings to customers worldwide via deployment models that best suit their needs including via our cloudbased SaaS PaaS IaaS and DaaS offerings As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT instances are deployed using the Oracle Cloud while other of their IT instances are deployed using Oracle onpremise offerings As these business models continue to evolve we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our onpremise enterprise software offerings and our cloud offerings and has a dampening impact on overall demand for our onpremise software product and service offerings which has reduced and could continue to reduce our revenues and profitability at least in the near term If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our new software licenses and hardware arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements Customers generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions The deferred revenue that results from sales of our cloud offerings may prevent any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings from becoming immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations This is in contrast to revenues associated with our new software licenses arrangements whereby new software licenses revenues are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related software licenses We incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings We have also acquired a number of cloud computing companies and the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient or scalable as anticipated which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services Rapid technological advances changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand customers may not purchase or subscribe to our software hardware or cloud offerings or renew software support hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business In addition we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas 22 Table of Contents We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud and onpremise software and hardware products and services including our Database Multitenant Database InMemory SaaS PaaS Generation 2 IaaS Version 122 DaaS and Oracle Engineered Systems offerings Our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames there is a delay in market acceptance of new enhanced or acquired product lines or services there are changes in information technology IT trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services or we fail to adequately integrate support or enhance acquired product lines or services If our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result our data our customers data or our IT systems are accessed improperly made unavailable or improperly modified our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable our brand and reputation could be damaged the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using our products and services all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions We are in the IT business and our products and services including our Oracle Cloud offerings store retrieve manipulate and manage our customers information and data external data as well as our own data We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products services and the internal and external data that we manage At times we encounter attempts by third parties which may include nation states and individuals sponsored by them to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities penetrate or bypass our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers partners and suppliers software hardware and cloud offerings networks and systems any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers Computer hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our networks systems products and services exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our networks systems products and services create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service This is also true for thirdparty data products or services incorporated into our own Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer partner employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers partners employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data our customers suppliers or partners data or the IT systems of Oracle its customers suppliers or partners Highprofile security breaches at other companies have increased in recent years and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting IT products and businesses Although this is an industrywide problem that affects software and hardware companies generally it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most prominent IT companies and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for and marketing efforts associated with having secure products and services These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of data including personal information and our customers confidential information and data and other external data and host or manage parts of our customers businesses in cloudbased IT environments especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences financial services and the government We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies products services and technologies over the years While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle We could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers or suppliers data other external data or our 23 Table of Contents own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted or if our products or services are perceived as having security vulnerabilities Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services including our cloud offerings and perceive them to be not secure This could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenue and earnings The costs we would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses These types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits regulatory investigations and claims and increased legal liability including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring Our business practices with respect to the collection use and management of personal information could give rise to operational interruption liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify For example the European Union EU and the United States US formally entered into a new framework in July 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the US This new framework called the Privacy Shield is intended to address shortcomings identified by the Court of Justice of the EU in the previous EUUS Safe Harbor Framework which the Court of Justice invalidated in October 2015 The Privacy Shield and other data transfer mechanisms are likely to be reviewed by the European courts which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers to the US or interruption of such transfers In the event any court blocks transfers to or from a particular jurisdiction on the basis that no transfer mechanisms are legally adequate this could give rise to operational interruption in the performance of services for customers and internal processing of employee information regulatory liabilities or reputational harm In addition US and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations in a manner that could significantly impact the ability of Oracle and our customers and data partners to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services Oracle provides This could be true particularly in those jurisdictions where privacy laws or regulators take a broader view of how personal information is defined therefore subjecting the handling of such data to heightened restrictions that may be obstructive to the operations of Oracle and its customers and data providers This impact may be acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized in country as this imposes financial costs on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdictions not of its choosing and nonstandard operational processes that are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations For example in 2016 the EU adopted a new law governing data practices and privacy called the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which becomes effective in May 2018 The law establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal data Noncompliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data such as healthcare data or other personal information could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions that we operate Additionally public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly in ways that may affect Oracles reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit Oracles ability to provide certain products Any failure or perceived failure by Oracle to comply with US federal state or foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations regulating privacy data security or consumer protection or other policies public perception standards selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in lost or restricted business proceedings actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation We might experience significant coding manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud software and hardware offerings Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service our cloud software and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors that can impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud software or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly Errors in our 24 Table of Contents cloud software or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other cloud software or hardware offerings could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services This includes thirdparty software products or services incorporated into our own If we experience errors or delays in releasing our cloud software or hardware offerings or new versions thereof our sales could be affected and revenues could decline In addition we run Oracles business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks Therefore any flaws could affect our ability to conduct our business operations and the operations of our customers Enterprise customers rely on our cloud software and hardware offerings and services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud software or hardware offerings could expose us to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation which could impact our future sales We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors Our revenues particularly our cloud revenues new software licenses revenues and hardware revenues are difficult to forecast As a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially We use a pipeline system a common industry practice to forecast sales and trends in our business Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate We may use conversion or renewal rates in our forecasts for our cloud business that differ materially from our actual conversion or renewal rates because this business is continuing to evolve and such rates may be unpredictable A reduction in the conversion rate or in the pipeline itself could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations In particular a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms which can also impede our ability to negotiate execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner In addition for newly acquired companies we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition Conversion rates postacquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies historical conversion rates Differences in conversion rates can also be affected by changes in business practices that we implement in our newly acquired companies These changes may negatively affect customer behavior A substantial portion of our new software licenses and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are larger orders Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability The number of large new software licenses transactions and to a lesser extent hardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions We may experience foreign currency gains and losses Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the US Dollar Changes in the values of major foreign currencies particularly the Euro Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the US Dollar can significantly affect our total assets revenues operating results and cash flows which are reported in US Dollars In particular the economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt obligations may cause the value of the Euro to fluctuate relative to the US Dollar Fluctuations in foreign currency rates including the strengthening of the US Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in US Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into US Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currencybased enterprises to purchase In addition currency 25 Table of Contents variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the US Generally our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens In addition our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits among other assets are held in foreign currencies The US Dollar continued to strengthen relative to other currencies in fiscal 2017 which is reflected in our results In addition we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term which are charged against earnings in the period incurred We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures We may suspend the program from time to time As a part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses A large portion of our consolidated operations are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts For example we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or costeffective to hedge our foreign currency exposures if our hedging efforts are ineffective or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows Certain of our international subsidiaries operate in economies that have been designated as highly inflationary We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in these highly inflationary economies relative to the US Dollar and we may continue to incur such losses in these countries or other emerging market countries where we do business Economic political and market conditions can adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting These include general economic and business conditions overall demand for enterprise cloud software and hardware products and services governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities and general political developments Macroeconomic developments like the developments associated with the United Kingdoms vote to exit the European Union or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic political or market conditions could negatively affect our business operating results financial condition and outlook which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Any general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services In addition political unrest in places like Syria Ukraine Iraq Venezuela and Turkey and the related potential impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of new software licenses 26 Table of Contents hardware and related services and to a lesser extent also may affect our renewal rates for software license updates and product support and our subscriptionbased cloud offerings If we are unable to compete effectively the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed We face intense competition in all aspects of our business The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge expand or are acquired as technology evolves and as delivery models change Many vendors develop and market databases middleware products application development tools business applications collaboration products and business intelligence products among others that compete with our cloud and onpremise software offerings These vendors include onpremise software companies and companies that offer cloudbased SaaS PaaS IaaS and DaaS offerings and business process outsourcing BPO as competitive alternatives to buying software and hardware Our competitors that offer business applications and middleware products may influence a customers purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customers not to acquire our products We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products add new functionality acquire competitive products reduce prices better execute on their sales and marketing strategies or form strategic alliances with other companies We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense Our hardware business competes with among others 1 systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating systems and those of our competitors 2 microprocessorchip manufacturers 3 providers of storage products 4 certain industryspecific hardware manufacturers including those serving communications hospitality and retail industries and 5 certain cloud providers that build their own IT infrastructures Our hardware business causes us to compete with certain companies that historically have been partners Some of these competitors may have more experience than we do in managing a hardware business A significant portion of our hardware products are based on our SPARC microprocessor and Oracle Solaris operating system platform which has a smaller installed base than certain of our competitors platforms and which may make it difficult for us to win new customers that have already made significant investments in our competitors platforms Certain of these competitors also compete very aggressively on price A loss in our competitive position could result in lower revenues or profitability which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardware business We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our onpremise software hardware and services offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability Our software license updates and product support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net new software licenses fees and net new hardware products fees respectively Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings or support pricing Any broadbased change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations These practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the US Our international operations include cloud operations cloud software and hardware development 27 Table of Contents manufacturing assembly sales customer support consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers Compliance with international and US laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions These laws and regulations include US laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials import and trade restrictions and export requirements Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results Compliance with these laws requires a significant amount of management attention and effort which may divert managements attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded Where circumstances warrant we provide information and report our findings to government authorities but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries including those related to general economic conditions in each country or region fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to customer demand and our operating results difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries such as Venezuela that have led to a devaluation of our net assets in particular our cash assets in that countrys currency regulatory changes including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries political unrest terrorism and the potential for other hostilities including those in Syria Ukraine Iraq Venezuela and Turkey common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics practices and conduct policies natural disasters the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding wildfires and increased storm sensitivity longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable overlapping tax regimes our ability to repatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the US at favorable tax rates public health risks particularly in areas in which we have significant operations and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware business and the sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions 28 Table of Contents As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited a publicly traded company in India and Oracle Corporation Japan a publicly traded company in Japan we are faced with several additional risks including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if these entities were whollyowned subsidiaries Acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction We continue to invest billions of dollars to acquire companies products services and technologies We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include our ongoing business may be disrupted and our managements attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities we may have difficulties 1 managing an acquired companys technologies or lines of business 2 entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions or 3 retaining key personnel from the acquired companies an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected we may impose our business practices or alter gotomarket strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by 1 claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition including among others claims from government agencies terminated employees current or former customers former stockholders or other third parties 2 preexisting contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business 3 unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired companys practices and 4 intellectual property claims or disputes we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes due a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons including if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew cloudbased subscription contracts or software or hardware support contracts if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base or if contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies products services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of business and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards architecture controls procedures and policies we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered priced and supported differently which could cause customer confusion and delays we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products or services in general and administrative functions that support new business models or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from or may otherwise have certain limitations restrictions penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses 29 Table of Contents we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis if at all which could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash including stock repurchases dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness we may significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease and we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to US generally accepted accounting principles including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions Our hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline Our hardware business may adversely affect our overall profitability if we change our business strategies do not adapt to changes in market offerings or manage the associated risks We may not achieve our estimated revenue profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors including our changes in hardware strategies offerings and technologies such as cloud infrastructure compute and storage services including our own Oracle Cloud offerings which could adversely affect demand for our onpremise hardware products our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues and thus has been less profitable than our cloud and onpremise software business our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine Oracle SuperCluster products and Oracle Cloud at Customer portfolio and the deemphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products which could adversely affect our hardware revenues because the lower profit products have historically constituted a larger portion of our hardware revenues changes in strategies for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products including the pace at which we offer new versions or next generations of our hardware products and the related impacts from customers that may defer or delay purchases of existing hardware products and wait for these new releases all of which could adversely affect our hardware revenues in the short term a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results such as potential writedowns and impairments of our inventories higher warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and onpremise software and services businesses and amortization and potential impairment of intangible assets associated with our hardware business the close connection between hardware products which have a finite life and customer demand for related hardware support in which hardware products that approach the end of their useful lives are less likely to have hardware support contracts renewed by customers and 30 Table of Contents we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but 1 operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operating margins than our own 2 have different legacy business practices and gotomarket strategies than our own that we may alter as a part of our integration efforts which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company 3 leverage different platforms or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating or 4 utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquired products within our own manufacturing operations Our hardware offerings are complex products and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity the results of our hardware business will suffer Designing developing manufacturing and introducing new hardware products are complicated processes The development process for our hardware products is uncertain and requires a high level of innovation After the development phase we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do so in a costeffective manner Our buildtoorder manufacturing model in which our hardware products generally are not built until after customers place orders may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware products to customers in a timely manner These delays could cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors We must also manage new hardware product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchases of existing hardware products in anticipation of new hardware product releases It is also possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws which could delay or prevent the production of the components for which we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardware products to be returned recalled or rejected resulting in lost revenues increases in warranty costs or costs related to remediation efforts damage to our reputation penalties and litigation We depend on suppliers to design develop manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price quality technology availability or other business constraints As a result our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation natural disasters political unrest port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience significant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies parts or components from a particular vendor If we had to find a new supplier for these technologies parts and components hardware product shipments could be delayed which would adversely affect our hardware revenues We could also experience fluctuations in component prices which if unanticipated could negatively impact our hardware business cost structure Additionally we could experience changes in shipping and logistics of our hardware products which could result in fluctuations in prices and negatively impact our hardware margins These factors may make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a timely fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware products Therefore we may experience component inventory shortages which may result in production delays or customers choosing to purchase fewer hardware products from us or hardware products from our competitors We negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient technologies and components for our hardware products to meet anticipated customer demand We must also manage our levels of older component inventories used in our hardware products to minimize inventory writeoffs or writedowns If we have excess inventory it may be necessary to writedown the inventory which would adversely affect our operating results If one or more of the risks described above occurs our hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected We are susceptible to thirdparty manufacturing and logistics delays which could result in the loss of sales and customers We outsource the design manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the US Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs product supply and delivery delays as well as the political and economic uncertainties and natural disasters of the international locations where certain of these thirdparty manufacturers 31 Table of Contents have facilities and operations Some countries may raise national security concerns or impose market access restrictions based on location of manufacture or sourcing Any manufacturing disruption or logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for these hardware products for extended periods of time If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively or if these third parties experience delays disruptions capacity constraints regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our hardware products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware business could be harmed We have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of thirdparty manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these thirdparty manufacturers build our hardware products We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturing partners and locations If these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timely or costeffective manner if at all If we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled hardware products deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses all of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business These challenges and risks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware products and related supply chain operations In some cases we may be dependent at least initially on these acquired companies supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these challenges and risks Our cloud software and hardware indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results Our cloud software and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers system integratorsimplementers consultants education providers internet service providers network integrators and independent software vendors Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud software and hardware marketing and sales efforts Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants products and services were to decrease There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants If we are not successful we may lose sales opportunities customers and revenues We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights We rely on copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights Despite our efforts these protections may be limited Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property Any patents owned by us may be invalidated circumvented or challenged Any of our pending or future patent applications whether or not being currently challenged may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek if at all In addition the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the US If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive Third parties have claimed and in the future may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights andor breach of license agreement provisions We periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse We expect to continue to receive such claims as we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows 32 Table of Contents the use and support of thirdparty code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the industry the volume of issued patents continues to increase and nonpracticing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments Responding to any such claim regardless of its validity could be time consuming costly and result in litigation divert managements time and attention from developing our business require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products require us to release source code to third parties possibly under open source license terms require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers or otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows Our periodic workforce restructurings including reorganizations of our sales force can be disruptive We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce including our direct sales force on which we rely heavily in response to management changes product changes performance issues change in strategies acquisitions and other internal and external considerations In the past these types of sales force restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs increased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the sales teams adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities In addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings or do so within the expected timeframe These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management including our Chairman of the Board of Directors Chief Technology Officer and founder our Chief Executive Officers other members of our executive team and other key employees In the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel With rare exceptions we do not have longterm employment or noncompetition agreements with our employees Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs When we make adjustments to our workforce we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program Our general compensation program includes restricted stock units performance stock units and stock options which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry If our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stockbased compensation which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel 33 Table of Contents Our sales to government clients expose us to business volatility and risks including government budgeting cycles and appropriations early termination audits investigations sanctions and penalties We derive revenues from contracts with the US government state and local governments and foreign governments and their respective agencies which may terminate most of these contracts at any time without cause There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending Further our US federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations made by the US Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts Similarly our contracts with US state and local governments foreign governments and their agencies are generally subject to government funding authorizations Additionally government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all Developing cloud software and hardware offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired Accelerated product and service introductions and short software and hardware life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position However we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all Business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services including some of our cloud offerings A major earthquake fire other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change such as increased storm severity drought and pandemics that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected Adverse litigation results could affect our business We are subject to various legal proceedings Litigation can be lengthy expensive and disruptive to our operations and can divert our managements attention away from running our core business The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business operating results or financial condition Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities As a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the US and various foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities We are regularly under audit by tax authorities and those authorities often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate For example the US many countries in the EU and other countries where we do business are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals In particular reforming the taxation of international businesses has been a priority for US politicians and key members of the legislative and executive branches have proposed a wide variety of potential changes any of which could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate Further in the ordinary course of a global business there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the US Internal Revenue Service IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future Although we have negotiated certain unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements with the IRS and certain selected bilateral Advance Pricing Agreements that cover some of 34 Table of Contents our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the relevant tax authorities from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing In recent periods transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become increasingly contentious Similarly certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters In addition our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the US that have lower statutory tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates We are also subject to nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the US and various foreign jurisdictions We are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome based taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome based tax liabilities Our acquisition activities have increased our nonincome based tax exposures particularly with our entry into the hardware business which increased the volume and complexity of laws and regulations that we are subject to and with which we must comply Although we believe that our income and nonincome based tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to ASC 805 Business Combinations we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and in each case separately from goodwill Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred which is also generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain After we complete an acquisition the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention redeployment or relocation expenses impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets both asset types of which have increased due to our recent acquisitions and may continue to increase in the future amortization of intangible assets acquired a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities both income tax and nonincome tax related after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period generally up to one year from the acquisition date whichever comes first charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative premerger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities for a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated charges to eliminate certain duplicative premerger activities and charges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition and charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred For example we recognized a goodwill impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 relating to our hardware reporting unit Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 35 Table of Contents There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness As of May 31 2017 we had an aggregate of 579 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt Furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase Should we incur future increases in interest expense our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our US federal income tax could be limited which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate In addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs Some of our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state federal and international laws governing protection of the environment proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products human health and safety the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers as well as local testing and labelling requirements We endeavor to comply with these environmental and other laws yet compliance with these environmental and other laws could increase our product design development procurement manufacturing delivery cloud operations and administration costs limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete noncompliant inventory change our sales activities or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability including fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses The US Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain conflict minerals commonly referred to as tantalum tin tungsten and gold in their products Our supply chain is multitiered global and highly complex As a provider of hardware end products we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain Accordingly our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited Our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales Environmental legislation such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances RoHS the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive WEEE Directive and Chinas regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements The cumulative impact of international environmental legislation could be significant Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes could also affect our stock price Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect our stock price Our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 36 Table of Contents Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties Our properties consist of owned and leased office facilities for sales support research and development services

international currencies relative to the US Dollar which decreased our fiscal 2016 total revenues by 5 percentage points and total operating income by 7 percentage points in comparison to the corresponding prior year period Total working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during all periods presented and the issuances of longterm senior notes of 140 billion in fiscal 2017 200 billion in fiscal 2015 20 billion and 30 billion in fiscal 2014 and 50 billion in fiscal 2013 Our total assets were also favorably impacted by the issuance of 38 billion of shortterm borrowings in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments made in all periods presented repayments of certain of our senior notes in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2013 and the repayment of 38 billion of shortterm borrowings in fiscal 2017 In fiscal 2016 we adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 201517 Income Taxes Topic 740 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes on a retrospective basis Pursuant to the new accounting standard all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheets and the working capital amounts presented above for fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 have been recast accordingly Our notes payable and other borrowings which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings current and notes payable and other borrowings noncurrent as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above increased between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2017 primarily due to the fiscal 2017 issuance of longterm senior notes of 140 billion and shortterm borrowings of 38 billion the fiscal 2016 issuance of 38 billion of shortterm borrowings and the issuances of longterm senior notes of 200 billion in fiscal 2015 20 billion and 30 billion in fiscal 2014 and 50 billion in fiscal 2013 See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our notes payable and other borrowings 40 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition Business Overview Oracle Corporation provides products and services that address all aspects of corporate information technology IT environmentsapplications platform and infrastructure Our products are delivered to over 400000 worldwide customers through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models including onpremise cloudbased or hybrid that enable customer choice and best meet customer IT needs Our Oracle Cloud offerings provide a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of applications platform compute storage and networking services in all three primary layers of the cloud Software as a Service SaaS Platform as a Service PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service IaaS Our onpremise IT offerings include Oracle Applications Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware software among others hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage and industryspecific products among others and related support and services We provide our cloud and onpremise offerings to businesses of many sizes government agencies educational institutions and resellers with a sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best suit customer needs Our comprehensive and fully integrated stack of Oracle Cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings integrate the software hardware and services on the customers behalf in IT environments that we deploy support and manage for the customer Our integrated Oracle Cloud offerings are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation easily maintainable to reduce integration and testing work connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between cloud and onpremise IT environments compatible to easily move workloads between onpremise IT environments and the Oracle Cloud costeffective by requiring lower upfront customer investment and secure standardsbased and reliable We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud IT environments including database and middleware software as well as enterprise applications virtualization clustering largescale systems management and related infrastructure Our products and services are the building blocks of our Oracle Cloud services our partners cloud services and our customers cloud IT environments In addition to providing a broad spectrum of cloud offerings we develop and sell our applications platform and infrastructure products and services to our customers worldwide for use in their global data centers and onpremise IT environments An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue our investments in and innovation with respect to our products and services that we offer through our cloud and onpremise software hardware and services businesses We have a deep understanding as to how applications platform and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another within IT environments We focus our development efforts on improving the performance security operation and integration of these differing technologies to make them more costeffective and easier to deploy manage and maintain for our customers and to improve their computing performance relative to our competitors After the initial purchase of Oracle products and services our customers can continue to benefit from our research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by purchasing and renewing Oracle support offerings for their onpremise deployments which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products andor by renewing their SaaS PaaS and IaaS contracts with us As customers deploy with the Oracle Cloud many are adopting a hybrid IT model whereby certain of their IT instances are deployed using the Oracle Cloud while other of their IT instances are deployed using Oracle onpremise offerings and both instances are designed with capabilities to be manageable as one Our Oracle Cloud at Customer program provides another deployment option that utilizes the Oracle Cloud Machine and Oracle Database Exadata Cloud Machine to bring certain Oracle Cloud PaaS and IaaS offerings to a customers onpremise IT environment to meet data sovereignty data residency data protection and regulatory business policy requirements among others while benefiting from many advantages of a cloud service 41 Table of Contents A selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers expand our customer base provide greater scale to accelerate innovation grow our revenues and earnings and increase stockholder value In recent years we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies products services and technologies that add to are complementary to or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings On November 7 2016 we acquired NetSuite Inc NetSuite Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our acquisition of NetSuite We expect to continue to acquire companies products services and technologies to further our corporate strategy In recent periods customer demand has increased at a greater rate for cloudbased IT deployment models relative to onpremise IT deployment models To address this demand we have increased our investment in and focus on the development marketing and sale of our cloudbased applications platform and infrastructure technologies resulting in higher growth of our SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues as customer preferences have pivoted to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and as customers migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing onpremise workloads We expect these trends to continue We believe that offering customers broad comprehensive flexible and interoperable deployment models for our applications platform and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors many of whom provide fewer offerings and more restrictive deployment models We enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT deployment model at whatever pace is most appropriate for them We have three businesses cloud and onpremise software hardware and services each of which comprises a single operating segment Our chief operating decision makers CODMs which include our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer view the operating results of our three businesses and allocate resources in a manner that is consistent with the changing market dynamics that we have experienced in recent periods As a result during fiscal 2017 we updated our operating segments The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations presented below provides the current view that is utilized by our CODMs to evaluate performance and determine resource allocations In addition to the discussion below Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our businesses and operating segments including the recasting of our segments financial information from prior periods to conform to the current years presentation Cloud and OnPremise Software Business Our cloud and onpremise software line of business markets sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and onpremise software offerings Our cloud and onpremise software revenues represented 80 78 and 77 of our total revenues in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Our Oracle Cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings deliver applications platform and infrastructure technologies via cloudbased deployment models that we host manage and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management maintenance and security services for onpremise cloudbased or hybrid IT infrastructure for a stated period Our SaaS PaaS and IaaS arrangements are generally one to three years in duration and we strive to renew these contracts when they are eligible for renewal We offer customers the ability to license our software products including Oracle Applications Oracle Database Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java among others for onpremise and other IT environments Our new software license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software licenses revenues which is different than the typical revenue recognition for our cloudbased offerings for which revenues are generally recognized on a ratable basis over the subscription period New software license customers have the option to purchase software license updates and product support contracts which grant rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period as well as technical support assistance Our software 42 Table of Contents license updates and product support contracts are generally one year in duration and are generally billed in advance of the service being performed Our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues and new software licenses revenues are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings our acquisitions our ability to deliver and renew our cloud contracts with our existing customers and foreign currency rate fluctuations In recent periods we have placed significant strategic emphasis on growing our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues which represented 12 8 and 6 of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively This emphasis has affected the growth of our new software licenses revenues and to a lesser extent has also affected the growth of our software license updates and product support revenues We expect these trends will continue with the mix of revenues continuing to shift toward cloudbased services for this business Our software license updates and product support revenues growth is primarily influenced by four factors 1 the percentage of our software support contract customer base that renews its software support contracts 2 the pricing of new software support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses 3 the pricing of new software licenses sold and 4 the amount of software support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired Substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they acquire onpremise new software licenses and renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually in order to benefit from Oracles research and development investments that are utilized as a part of periodic software updates that are released and that customers with current software support contracts are entitled to On a constant currency basis we expect that our total cloud and onpremise software revenues generally will continue to increase due to expected growth in our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings continued demand for our onpremise software products and software license updates and product support offerings including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts and contributions from our acquisitions We believe all of these factors should contribute to growing our cloud and onpremise software revenues which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development Our cloud and onpremise software business segment margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software licenses revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term Hardware Business Our hardware business represented 11 13 and 14 of our total revenues in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Our hardware business provides a broad selection of hardware products and hardwarerelated software products including Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage industryspecific hardware virtualization software operating systems management software and related hardware services including hardware support We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and valueadded resellers Our hardware support offerings provide customers with software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software products and can include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and onpremise software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services including direct materials and labor costs 43 Table of Contents Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict Our hardware revenues cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware products the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products which have a finite life and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations Services Business Our services business helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications platform and infrastructure technologies We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies extensive experience and broad sets of intellectual property and best practices Our services offerings include consulting services advanced support services and education services and represented 9 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 Our services business has lower segment margins than our cloud and onpremise software and hardware businesses Our services revenues are impacted by our strategy for and the competitive position of our services certain of our acquisitions general economic conditions governmental budgetary constraints personnel reductions in our customers IT departments tighter controls over discretionary spending our strategic emphasis on growing our cloud revenues and customer demand for our cloud and onpremise software and hardware offerings Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy In recent years we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies products services and technologies including NetSuite in fiscal 2017 and MICROS in fiscal 2015 We expect to continue to acquire companies products services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings operating margin cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission GAAP as set forth within the ASC requires us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent that there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our financial statements will be affected The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include Revenue Recognition Business Combinations 44 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments Accounting for Income Taxes and Legal and Other Contingencies In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include cloud and onpremise software revenues which include the sale of cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings which generally grant customers access to a broad range of our applications platform and infrastructure technologies and related support and services offerings on a subscription basis in a secure standardsbased cloud computing environment new software licenses which generally grant to customers a perpetual right to use our database middleware applications and industryspecific software products and software license updates and product support offerings described further below hardware revenues which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems computer servers and storage products and industryspecific hardware and hardware support revenues described further below and services revenues which are earned from providing cloud software and hardware related services including consulting advanced customer support and education services Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities Revenue Recognition for Cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS Offerings Hardware Products Hardware Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Elements Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables including cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware products hardware support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 60525 Revenue Recognition MultipleElement Arrangements and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues hardware products revenues hardware support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met Our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software andor infrastructure within a cloudbased IT environment that we manage host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis Our cloud IaaS offerings also include deployment and management services for software and hardware related IT infrastructure Revenues for our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems computer servers storage and industryspecific hardware and are recognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 45 Table of Contents Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements which is typically one year provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsCloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS Offerings Hardware Products Hardware Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Arrangements We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements Each element within a nonsoftware multipleelement arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer Further our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement or in the case of our cloud offerings we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements For our nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy VSOE if available thirdparty evidence TPE if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available a description as to how we determine VSOE TPE and ESP is provided below If a tangible hardware product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the products essential functionality and if so the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions When possible we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support based on the renewal rates offered to customers TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including but not limited to pricing practices including discounting margin objectives competition contractually stated prices the geographies in which we offer our products and services the type of customer ie distributor valueadded reseller government agency and direct end user among others and the stage of the product lifecycle The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management taking into consideration our pricing model and gotomarket strategy As our or our competitors pricing and gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future 46 Table of Contents which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE TPE and ESP As a result our future revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services Software Elements New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database middleware applications and industryspecific software products and exclude cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates which are included in software license updates and product support revenues The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985605 SoftwareRevenue Recognition We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize new software licenses revenues when 1 we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software 2 we deliver the products 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties and 4 collection is probable Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions However if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy for example in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are shortterm in nature we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example acceptance provisions that are longterm in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts which are entered into at the customers option and the related fees are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement typically one year Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement Arrangements Software Products Software Support and Software Related Services Software Arrangements We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase software related products software support and software related services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as software related multipleelement arrangements Such software related multipleelement arrangements include the sale of our software products software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements For those software related multipleelement arrangements we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985605 Under the residual method if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multipleelement arrangement such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multipleelement arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendorspecific objective evidence VSOEdescribed further above with any remaining amount allocated to the software license 47 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement Arrangements Arrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multipleelement arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including new software licenses software license updates and product support cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware products hardware support consulting advanced customer support services and education In such arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985605 and our policies as described above In addition we allocate the consideration within the nonsoftware group to each respective element within that group based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception as described above After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and nonsoftware group of elements we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above and below Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985605 The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of services from other vendors timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed When total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and nonsoftware products and services We offer these advanced support services both onpremise and remote to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services Depending upon the nature of the arrangement revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period which is generally one year or less Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructorled mediabased and internetbased training in the use of our cloud software and hardware products Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions then new software licenses revenues andor hardware products revenues including the costs of hardware products are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method 48 Table of Contents We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions when such provisions are required by law to determine the probability of possible cancellation We consider multiple factors including the history with the customer in similar transactions the essential use of the software or hardware products and the planning budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met If such a determination cannot be made revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met Our standard payment terms are net 30 days However payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed We evaluate nonstandard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements based upon similarity of customers products and license economics and if so generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include shortterm payment terms we have a standard practice of providing longterm financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division Since fiscal 1989 when our financing division was formed we have established a history of collection without concessions on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize new software licenses revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery net of any payment discounts from financing transactions We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a nonrecourse basis to thirdparty financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows We account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies Concurrent Transactions Software license agreements sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a threemonth time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure When we acquire goods or services from a customer we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction at terms we consider to be at arms length and settle the purchase in cash We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations in accounting for our acquisitions It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets contractual obligations assumed preacquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration where applicable Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part 49 Table of Contents on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from assumed cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS contracts software support contracts and hardware support contracts for which our future expected cash flow estimates include estimated cash flow amounts and time periods over which such cash flows are expected to be received estimated retention and renewal rates of existing customer contracts assumed as a part of the acquisition and estimated costs to sell market deliver and support such assumed contracts among other estimates future expected cash flows from acquired developed technology including estimated amounts to be received for such developed technology and the time period over which such cash flows are expected to be received among other estimates and discount rates Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results We estimate the fair values of our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS software license updates and product support and hardware support obligations assumed as part of an acquisition The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost buildup approach The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling these assumed obligations plus a normal profit margin The estimated costs to fulfill the assumed obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition As a result of our fair value estimates for these obligations we did not recognize certain cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for further discussion Historically substantially all of our customers including customers from acquired companies renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS contracts and hardware support contracts when they are eligible for renewal To the extent customers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective contracts renewal periods In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management but may be refined in subsequent periods We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities assumptions are applied regarding estimated sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made For a given acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in 50 Table of Contents order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a preacquisition contingency nonincome tax related by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 IntangiblesGoodwill and Other According to ASC 350 we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the twostep impairment test Based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test prescribed by ASC 350 will be performed In the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables We base our fair value estimates on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain Actual future results may differ from those estimates In addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units We completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment as of March 1 2017 prior to our operating segment changes We also subsequently performed a goodwill impairment test after such changes had been effected Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any goodwill impairment charges nor did we recognize any impairment charges in fiscal 2016 In fiscal 2015 we recognized an impairment charge of 186 million related to our hardware business All of our reporting units had fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values based on our most recent annual goodwill impairment review We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate If the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 51 Table of Contents Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective They can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts Although we believe that the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2017 2016 or 2015 Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision In the ordinary course of a global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no US taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States Remittances of foreign earnings to the United States are planned based on projected cash flow working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations Based on these assumptions we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States and provide US federal taxes on these amounts Material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the United States or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the United States could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located We consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time We record deferred tax assets for stockbased compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions Beginning in fiscal 2017 refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our fiscal 2017 adoption of ASU 201609 CompensationStock Compensation Topic 718 Improvements to Employee ShareBased Payment Accounting the impacts of the actual tax deductions for stockbased awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized to our consolidated statements of operations in the period that a restricted stockbased award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfallwindfall relative to the deferred tax asset established recorded as a discrete detrimentbenefit to our provision for income taxes in this period Such detrimentbenefit can materially impact our reported effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and prospective periods We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year Adjustments based on filed 52 Table of Contents returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known which can materially impact our effective tax rate The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740 Income Taxes which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit judicial rulings and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties In addition as a part of our accounting for business combinations intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure however deferred taxes have been recorded for nondeductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable Because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made As additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Results of Operations Impacts of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was impacted by our recent acquisitions In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the oneyear period subsequent to the acquisition date to the growth in certain of our businesses revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations When material we may also 53 Table of Contents provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations andor were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented We caution readers that while pre and postacquisition comparisons as well as any quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies including our sales force integration efforts We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated the relative mix of products and services sold would have been different and although substantially all of our onpremise software license customers including customers from acquired companies renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS contracts and hardware support contracts the amounts shown as cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS deferred revenues software license updates and product support deferred revenues and hardware support deferred revenues in our Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges presented below are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information In our results of operations discussion below we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues total consolidated expenses and total consolidated operating margin all of which are presented on a GAAP basis We also present a GAAP based discussion for substantially all of the other expense items described below that are not directly attributable to our operating segments In addition we discuss below the results of each our three businessescloud and onpremise software hardware and serviceswhich also are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280 Segment Reporting The financial reporting for our three operating segments that is presented in the results of operations discussion below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three operating segments We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each operating segment in the discussion below Consistent with our internal management reporting processes the below operating segment presentation includes revenues related to cloud and onpremise software and hardware contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements Refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for additional discussion of these items and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in

presented In addition research and development expenses general and administrative expenses stockbased compensation expenses amortization of intangible assets certain other expense allocations acquisition related and other expenses restructuring expenses interest expense nonoperating income net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our businesses including such items andor it is impractical to do so Refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for additional

as presented below to total income before provision of income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented 54 Table of Contents Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses revenues and expenses As a result each businesses revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the US Dollar against major international currencies In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure To present this information current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US Dollars are converted into US Dollars at constant exchange rates ie the rates in effect on May 31 2016 which was the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods For example if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 10 million Euros from products sold on May 31 2017 and 2016 our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of 111 million in fiscal 2017 using 111 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period and 112 million in fiscal 2016 using 112 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period The constant currency presentation however would translate the fiscal 2017 results using the fiscal 2016 exchange rate and indicate in this example no change in revenues during the period In each of the tables below we present the percent change

Compared to Fiscal 2016 Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations our total revenues increased in fiscal 2017 due to growth in our cloud and onpremise software revenues and services revenues partially offset by a decrease in our hardware revenues The constant currency increase in our cloud and onpremise software revenues during fiscal 2017 was attributable to growth in our SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues growth in our software license updates and product support revenues and revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions and was partially offset by a decrease in our new software licenses revenues The constant 55 Table of Contents currency increase in our services revenues during fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions The constant currency decrease in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a reduction in our hardware products revenues and to a lesser extent a decline in our hardware support revenues In constant currency the Americas region contributed 54 the EMEA region contributed 24 and the Asia Pacific region contributed 22 to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2017 Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2017 relative to the prior year period due to higher sales and marketing and research and development expenses which were primarily attributable to increased headcount and increased stockbased compensation expenses and higher cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues These constant currency expense increases in fiscal 2017 were partially offset by lower hardware expenses in fiscal 2017 due to a decline in hardware products revenues and lower hardware support costs due primarily to lower headcount lower software support costs in fiscal 2017 due primarily to lower headcount and lower intangible asset amortization in fiscal 2017 due to certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized In constant currency our total operating margin increased in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in our total revenues while total operating margin as a percentage of revenues was flat Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were significantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the US Dollar which decreased our total revenues by 5 percentage points total operating expenses by 4 percentage points and total operating margin by 7 percentage points Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations our total revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to constant currency growth in our cloud and onpremise software business revenues and services business revenues due to similar reasons noted for the fiscal 2017 increases above These constant currency increases in our revenues during fiscal 2016 were partially offset by constant currency decreases in our hardware business revenues In constant currency the EMEA region and the Asia Pacific region contributed approximately equal amounts to our fiscal 2016 total revenues growth and the Americas region was flat Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate fluctuations our total operating expenses

the Fiscal 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan 2015 Restructuring Plan see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and higher general and administrative expenses due primarily to higher professional services fees primarily legal related fees These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2016 reductions in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized during fiscal 2016 and lower acquisition related and other expenses which decreased relative to fiscal 2015 as a result of a goodwill impairment loss of 186 million that was recorded in fiscal 2015 Excluding the effects of unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 as our total expenses increased at a faster rate than our total revenues Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To

subscriptions software support and hardware support obligations assumed Due to our application of business combination accounting rules we did not recognize the cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS software license updates and product support and hardware support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations To the extent customers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective contracts renewal periods Certain acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related contractual terms Business combination accounting rules generally require us to eliminate these capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our postcombination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these deferred sales commissions balances This adjustment is intended to include and thus reflect the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented Represents the amortization of intangible assets substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions As of May 31 2017 estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows in millions Fiscal 2018 1588 Fiscal 2019 1419 Fiscal 2020 1219

resulted from unvested stock options and restricted stockbased awards assumed from acquisitions whose vesting was accelerated upon termination of the employees pursuant to the terms of those stock options and restricted stockbased awards The income tax effects presented were calculated as if the above described charges were not included in our results of operations for each of the respective periods presented Income tax effects for fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 were calculated based on the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to the items within the table above and resulted in effective tax rates of 228 232 and 236 respectively instead of 189 222 and 226 respectively which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations The difference between our fiscal 2017 tax rate derived from the table above and the tax rate derived from our consolidated statement of operations was primarily due to the net tax effects for stockbased compensation expense and acquisition related items including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets The difference between our fiscal 2016 and 2015 tax rates derived from the table above and the tax rates derived from our consolidated statements of operations were primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items including the tax effects of amortization of intangible

software for onpremise and other IT environments with the option to purchase software license updates and product support contracts Our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings are generally subscription based and generally recognized as revenues over the subscription period New software licenses revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses generally on a perpetual basis to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within onpremise and other IT environments and are generally recognized when unrestricted access to the software license is granted provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met Software license updates and product support revenues are typically generated through the sale of software support contracts related to onpremise new software licenses purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term We continue to place significant emphasis both domestically and internationally on direct sales through our own sales force We also continue to market our offerings through indirect channels Costs associated with our cloud and onpremise software business are included in cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS expenses software license updates and product support expenses and sales and marketing expenses These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure

revenues and decreases in our new software licenses revenues during fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the continued strategic emphasis placed on selling marketing and growing our cloud offerings and we expect these revenue trends will continue The increase in our fiscal 2017 software license updates and product support revenues was a result of substantially all customers electing to purchase software support contracts in conjunction with their new software licenses purchased and due to the renewal of substantially all of the software support customer base eligible for renewal during the fiscal 2017 and 2016 periods During fiscal 2017 the Americas EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed constant currency regional growth of 63 20 and 17 respectively In constant currency total cloud

during fiscal 2017 related to investment gains for our deferred compensation plan investments that we held and classified as trading in comparison to net losses for such investments during fiscal 2016 The aforementioned favorable movements in nonoperating income net during fiscal 2017 were partially offset by higher foreign currency losses net during fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 On a constant currency basis our nonoperating income net in fiscal 2016 increased primarily due to higher interest income resulting from higher interest rates and higher cash cash equivalent and

jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates The provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the US federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations state taxes the US research and development tax credit settlements with tax authorities and the US domestic production activity deduction In addition beginning in fiscal 2017 the provision for income taxes also differs from the tax computed at the US federal statutory tax rate due to tax effects of stockbased compensation refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of

Compared to Fiscal 2016 Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 decreased relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the favorable impact of excess tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2017 that related

paid in capital see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion To a lesser extent the provision for income taxes in fiscal

other events Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 decreased relative to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2015 due in substantial part to lower net income before provision for income taxes during fiscal 2016 settlements with certain tax authorities and the retroactive extension of the US research and development tax credit which collectively were

and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report As the US Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2017 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in US Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31 2017 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from our May 31 2016 balance sheet date The increase in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31 2016 in comparison to May 31 2015 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our operations during fiscal 2016 18 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2016 debt issuances net of debt repayments and cash inflows from fiscal 2016 stock option exercises These fiscal 2016 cash inflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2016 cash outflows primarily 104 billion for repurchases of our common stock payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures Additionally our reported cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of May 31 2016 decreased on a net basis in comparison to May 31 2015 as the US Dollar generally strengthened in comparison to most major international currencies during fiscal 2016 Days sales outstanding which we calculate by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter was 44 days at May 31 2017 compared with 46 days at May 31 2016 The days sales outstanding calculation excludes the impact of any revenue adjustments resulting from business combinations that reduced our acquired cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS obligations

activities Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts terms which are generally one year in length Over the course of a fiscal year we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new software licenses cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware products hardware support arrangements and services Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products taxes and leased facilities Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2017 primarily due to the cash favorable effects of higher net income in fiscal 2017 in relation to fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the cash unfavorable effects of lower net income and the related unfavorable currency rate fluctuations on our net income relative to the corresponding prior year period Cash flows from investing activities The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions the timing of our purchases maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets including certain intangible assets to support our growth 66 Table of Contents Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Net cash used for investing activities increased in fiscal 2017 relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions net of cash acquired in fiscal 2017 an increase in cash used to purchase marketable securities and other investments net of proceeds received from sales and maturities in fiscal 2017 and increased capital expenditures primarily related to our fiscal 2017 real estate purchases and investments in equipment to support our infrastructure to deliver our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net cash used to purchase marketable securities net of proceeds received from sales and maturities in fiscal 2016 and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions net of cash acquired in fiscal 2016 Cash flows from financing activities The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2017 was 91 billion in comparison to net cash used for financing activities of 100 billion during fiscal 2016 The change in financing activities cash flows during fiscal 2017 in comparison to fiscal 2016 was primarily related to borrowing activities net of debt repayments and stock repurchase activity We received 136 billion of net cash inflows from borrowing activities during fiscal 2017 in comparison to 18 billion of net cash inflows from fiscal 2016 borrowing activities In addition we significantly reduced our stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2017 using 36 billion in comparison to fiscal 2016 when we used 104 billion Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 We used net cash for financing activities of 100 billion during fiscal 2016 in comparison to net cash provided by financing activities of 96 billion during fiscal 2015 The change in financing activities cash flows during fiscal 2016 in comparison to fiscal 2015 was primarily related to borrowing activities net of debt repayments and stock repurchase activities Our borrowing activities net of repurchases provided 18 billion of net cash inflows in fiscal 2016 in comparison to 183 billion of net cash inflows in fiscal 2015 We used 104 billion for fiscal 2016 common stock repurchases in comparison to 81 billion used for fiscal 2015 common stock repurchase Free cash flow To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis we use nonGAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors The presentation of nonGAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity We calculate free cash flow as follows Year Ended May 31 Dollars in millions 2017 Change 2016 Change 2015 Net cash provided by operating

Customer Financing We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products hardware products and services offerings through separate longterm payment contracts We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a nonrecourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables We financed 912 million in fiscal 2017 12 billion in 2016 and 16 billion in fiscal 2015 respectively approximately 14 16 and 19 of our new software licenses revenues in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 67 Table of Contents Recent Financing Activities Cash Dividends In fiscal 2017 we declared and paid cash dividends of 064 per share that totaled 26 billion In June 2017 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 019 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on August 2 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 19 2017 Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors Revolving Credit Agreements In May 2017 we entered into four revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank NA as initial lender and administrative agent the 2017 Credit Agreements and borrowed 38 billion pursuant to these agreements The 2017 Credit Agreements provided us with shortterm borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes Interest for the 2017 Credit Agreements is based on either 1 a LIBORbased formula or 2 a base rate formula each as set forth in the 2017 Credit Agreements The borrowings are due and payable on June 29 2017 which is the termination date of the 2017 Credit Agreements Additional details regarding the 2017 Credit Agreements are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report In May 2016 we borrowed 38 billion pursuant to three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank NA as initial lender and administrative agent the 2016 Credit Agreements In June 2016 we repaid the 38 billion and the 2016 Credit Agreements expired pursuant to their terms Senior Notes In July 2016 we issued 140 billion of senior notes comprised of the following 425 billion of 190 senior notes due September 2021 25 billion of 240 senior notes due September 2023 30 billion of 265 senior notes due July 2026 125 billion of 385 senior notes due July 2036 and 30 billion of 400 senior notes due July 2046 We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes which may include stock repurchases payment of cash dividends on our common stock repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions Additional details regarding the senior notes are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Other Fiscal 2017 Borrowings Activities In connection with our acquisition of NetSuite in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we assumed 310 million par value of legacy NetSuite convertible notes NetSuite Debt which had a fair value of 342 million as of the acquisition date In December 2016 we repurchased and settled for cash substantially all of the NetSuite Debt refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion In the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we assumed 113 million of debt due August 1 2025 in connection with the acquisition of certain land and buildings Common Stock Repurchases Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock As of May 31 2017 approximately 53 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program We repurchased 856 million shares for 35 billion 2719 million shares for 104 billion and 1937 million shares for 81 billion in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments our debt repayment obligations described further below or repurchases of our debt our stock price and economic and market conditions Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b51 plan Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time Contractual Obligations The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual obligations and commitments Changes in our business needs 68 Table of Contents cancellation provisions changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments We have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows The following is a

of May 31 2017 after considering certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBORbased index Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements based upon the interest rates applicable as of May 31 2017 and are subject to change in future periods interest payments on our floatingrate senior notes that are based upon the interest rates applicable to the senior notes as of May 31 2017 and are subject to change in future periods and certain crosscurrency swap agreements for a series of our Euro denominated senior notes that have the economic effect of converting our fixedrate Eurodenominated debt including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to a fixedrate US Dollardenominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these crosscurrency swap agreements Principal and interest payments for our other Eurodenominated senior notes presented in the contractual obligations table above were estimated using foreign currency exchange rates as of May 31 2017 and are subject to change in future periods Refer to Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our notes payable and other borrowings and related derivative agreements Primarily represents leases of facilities and includes future minimum rent payments for facilities that we have vacated pursuant to our restructuring and merger integration activities We have approximately 53 million in facility obligations net of estimated sublease income for certain vacated locations in accrued restructuring on our consolidated balance sheet at May 31 2017 Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the payment We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture subassemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon leadtimes andor commercially standard leadtimes for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way As of May 31 2017 we had 58 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits including related interest and penalties recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2018 We are involved in claims and legal proceedings All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which are out of our control Notes 15 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information regarding these contingencies We believe that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements In 69 Table of Contents addition we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities OffBalance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors including the structure of sales force incentive compensation plans In addition our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer These seasonal factors are common in the technology industry These factors have historically caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year Similarly the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues in particular our cloud and onpremise software business and hardware business as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2018 The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters We believe that all necessary adjustments which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included

Awards and Stock Options Our stockbased compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders We recognize that restricted stockbased awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stockbased awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages Consistent with these dual goals our cumulative potential dilution since June 1 2014 has been a weightedaverage annualized rate of 12 per year The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stockbased awards or stock options granted and assumed net of restricted stockbased 70 Table of Contents awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company divided by the weightedaverage outstanding shares during the calculation period This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stockbased awards vest and stock options are exercised Of the outstanding stock options at May 31 2017 which generally have a tenyear exercise period less than 1 have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date In recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stockbased compensation program However we have recently reduced the level of our stock repurchases and we may further reduce repurchases in the future in order to use our available cash for acquisitions to pay dividends to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes At May 31 2017 the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stockbased awards and unexercised stock options regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date was 95 During fiscal 2017 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the organizationwide stockbased award grants to selected employees all stockbased award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of stockbased awards in excess of 100000 stock option equivalent shares A separate Plan Committee which is an executive officer committee approved individual stockbased award grants of up to 100000 stock option equivalent shares to nonexecutive officers and employees Restricted stockbased award and stock option activity from June 1 2014 through May 31 2017 is summarized as follows shares in millions

announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements if any and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements if any see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report 71 Table of Contents I tem 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investmentgrade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investmentgrade ratings criteria which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks In addition as of May 31 2017 substantially all of our marketable securities are high quality with approximately 32 having maturity dates within one year and 68 having maturity dates within one to five years a description of our marketable securities held is included in Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and Liquidity and Capital Resources above We hold a mix of both fixed and floatingrate debt securities The fair values of our fixedrate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of May 31 2017 we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by 348 million Our floatingrate debt securities serve to lower the overall risk to our investments portfolio associated with the risk of rising interest rates Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as availableforsale We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities For fiscal 2017 total interest income was 802 million with our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 147 on a worldwide basis The table below presents the approximate fair values of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and the related weightedaverage interest rates for our investment portfolio

Agreements Our total borrowings were 579 billion as of May 31 2017 consisting of 519 billion of fixedrate borrowings 23 billion of floatingrate borrowings FloatingRate Notes and 38 billion of other borrowings primarily under revolving credit agreements We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our 15 billion of 2375 senior notes due January 2019 January 2019 Notes our 20 billion of 225 senior notes due October 2019 October 2019 Notes and our 15 billion of 280 senior notes due July 2021 July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the January 2019 Notes October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to including the notional amounts and maturity dates We do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixedrate borrowings for trading purposes We are accounting for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 The total fair value gain of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31 2017 was 40 million If LIBORbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31 2017 the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by 153 million Additional details regarding our senior notes and related interest rate swap agreements are included in Notes 8 and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report 72 Table of Contents By issuing the FloatingRate Notes and by entering into the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR As of May 31 2017 the weightedaverage interest rate associated with our FloatingRate Notes and January 2019 Notes October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements was 168 Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates As of May 31 2017 if LIBORbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately 73 million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floatingrate borrowings Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations Given the short duration of the forward contracts amounts recorded generally are not significant The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is nonoperating income net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors As of May 31 2017 and 2016 the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 34 billion and 27 billion respectively As of May 31 2017 and 2016 the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 14 billion and 20 billion respectively The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31 2017 and 2016 Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in nonoperating income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were 152 million 110 million and 157 million in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future the amounts and timing of which are unknown Foreign Currency Translation RiskImpact on Cash Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into US Dollars In particular the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of 73 Table of Contents the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report As the US Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2017 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in US Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31 2017 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate from May 31 2016 As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in US Dollars for fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 were decreases of 86 million 115 million and 12 billion respectively The following table includes estimates of the US Dollar equivalent of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies that we held as of May 31 2017 in millions US Dollar Equivalent at May 31 2017 Euro 1331 Canadian Dollar 450 Japanese Yen 409 British Pound 277 Indian Rupee 266 Russian Ruble 253 Australian Dollar 237 Chinese Renminbi 174 Other foreign currencies 1780 Total cash cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies 5177 If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the US Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in US Dollars would have decreased by approximately 518 million assuming constant foreign currency cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances Foreign Currency Translation Risk Net Investment Hedge In July 2013 we issued 750 million of 3125 senior notes due July 2025 July 2025 Notes We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the US Dollar As a result provided there is no ineffectiveness related to the hedge the change in the carrying value of the Eurodenominated July 2025 Notes due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the effective portion is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report and totaled 1 million of net other comprehensive losses for fiscal 2017 Any remaining change in the carrying value of the July 2025 Notes representing any ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is recognized in nonoperating income net We did not record any ineffectiveness during fiscal 2017 Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Euro and the US Dollar will impact the amount of US Dollars that we will require to settle the July 2025 Notes at maturity If the US Dollar would have been weaker by 10 in comparison to the Euro as of May 31 2017 we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal portion of the July 2025 Notes in US Dollars would have increased by approximately 83 million Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The response to this item is submitted as a separate section of this Annual Report See Part IV Item

Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10K we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a15e and 15d15e Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Exchange Act such as this Annual Report on Form 10K is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the US Securities and Exchange Commission Disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure Our quarterly evaluation of disclosure controls includes an evaluation of some components of our internal control over financial reporting We also perform a separate annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the management report below The evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of their objectives and design our implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this Annual Report on Form 10K In the course of the controls evaluation we reviewed data errors or control problems identified and sought to confirm that appropriate corrective actions including process improvements were being undertaken This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10Q and Form 10K Many of the components of our disclosure controls are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by both our internal audit and finance organizations The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary We intend to maintain our disclosure controls as dynamic processes and procedures that we adjust as circumstances merit Based on our managements evaluation with the participation of our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report our Principal Executive Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a15f and 15d15f Under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2017 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commissions 2013 framework Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP Based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31 2017 We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2017 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report 75 Table of Contents Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of Exchange Act Rules 13a15 or 15d15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level However our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud A control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met Further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake Additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate Because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected Item 9B Other Information None 76 Table of Contents PART III Item 10 Directors Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Pursuant to

financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or

Oracle applications platform and infrastructure technologies Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977 Basis of Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracles stockholders for all periods presented The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have been included as a component of nonoperating income net in our consolidated statements of operations Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated Certain other prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues operating income or net income Included in acquisition related and other expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2016 and 2015 are an acquisition related benefit of 19 million and a litigation related benefit of 53 million respectively Further acquisition related and other expenses for fiscal 2015 included 186 million related to a goodwill impairment loss In fiscal 2017 we adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 201609 CompensationStock Compensation Topic 718 Improvements to Employee ShareBased Payment Accounting ASU 201609 As required by ASU 201609 excess tax benefits recognized on stockbased compensation expense are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of the provision for income taxes on a prospective basis As required by ASU 201609 excess tax benefits recognized on stockbased compensation expense are classified as an operating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows and we have applied this provision on a retrospective basis For fiscal 2016 and 2015 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 124 million and 244 million respectively with a corresponding offset to net cash used for financing activities Finally ASU 201609 allows for the option to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimating expected forfeitures over the course of a vesting period We have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur and the net cumulative effect of this change was recognized as a 9 million increase to additional paid in capital a 3 million increase to deferred tax assets and a 6 million reduction to retained earnings as of June 1 2016 In addition in fiscal 2017 we also adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates none of which had a material impact to our reported financial position or results of operations and cash flows ASU 201709 CompensationStock Compensation Topic

201615 Statement of Cash Flows Topic 230 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent that there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include cloud and onpremise software revenues which include the sale of cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings which generally grant customers access to a broad range of our applications platform and infrastructure technologies and related support and services offerings on a

occurs 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met Our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software andor infrastructure within a cloudbased IT environment that we manage host and support and offer to customers on a subscription basis Our cloud IaaS offerings also include deployment and management services for software and hardware and related IT infrastructure Revenues for our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems computer servers storage and industryspecific hardware and are recognized upon the delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements which is typically one year provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsCloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS Offerings Hardware Products Hardware Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Arrangements We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements Each element within a nonsoftware multipleelement arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer Further our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement or in the case of our cloud offerings we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud software subscription For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements For our nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy VSOE if available thirdparty evidence TPE if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available a description as to how we determine VSOE TPE and ESP is provided below If a tangible hardware product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the products essential functionality and if so the 88 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions When possible we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware support based on the renewal rates offered to customers TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including but not limited to pricing practices including discounting margin objectives competition contractually stated prices the geographies in which we offer our products and services the type of customer ie distributor valueadded reseller government agency and direct end user among others and the stage of the product lifecycle The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by our management taking into consideration our pricing model and gotomarket strategy As our or our competitors pricing and gotomarket strategies evolve we may modify our pricing practices in the future which could result in changes to our determination of VSOE TPE and ESP As a result our future revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period Selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices Revenue Recognition for Software Products and Software Related Services Software Elements New software licenses revenues primarily represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database middleware applications and industryspecific software products and exclude cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues and revenues derived from software license updates which are included in software license updates and product support revenues The basis for our new software licenses revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985605 Software Revenue Recognition We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and software related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize new software licenses revenues when 1 we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software 2 we deliver the products 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties and 4 collection is probable Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met Substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions However if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy for example in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are shortterm in nature we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met If acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example acceptance provisions that are longterm in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period The vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts which are entered into at the customers option and the related fees are recognized ratably over the 89 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 term of the arrangement typically one year Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period Product support includes internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel Software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software licenses fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term Substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsSoftware Products Software Support and Software Related Services Software Arrangements We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products software support and software related services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as software related multipleelement arrangements Such software related multipleelement arrangements include the sale of our software products software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements For those software related multipleelement arrangements we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of new software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985605 Under the residual method if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multipleelement arrangement such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the software license We allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multipleelement arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendorspecific objective evidence VSOEdescribed further above with any remaining amount allocated to the software license Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to both Software and Nonsoftware Elements Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsArrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multipleelement arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including new software licenses software license updates and product support cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings hardware products hardware support consulting advanced customer support services and education In such arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985605 and our policies as described above In addition we allocate the consideration within the nonsoftware group to each respective element within that group based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception as described above After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and nonsoftware group of elements we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above and below Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software licenses revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985605 The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of services from other vendors timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance 90 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 criteria on the realizability of the software license fee Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed If there is significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved We estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project If we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed When total cost estimates exceed revenues we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements A number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates including labor rates utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other software and nonsoftware products and services We offer these advanced support services both onpremise and remote to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services Depending upon the nature of the arrangement revenues from these services are recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period which is generally one year or less Education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructorled mediabased and internetbased training in the use of our cloud software and hardware products Education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions then new software licenses revenues andor hardware products revenues including the costs of hardware products are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions when such provisions are required by law to determine the probability of possible cancellation We consider multiple factors including the history with the customer in similar transactions the essential use of the software or hardware products and the planning budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met If such a determination cannot be made revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met Our standard payment terms are net 30 days However payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed We evaluate nonstandard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements based upon similarity of customers products and license economics and if so generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include shortterm payment terms we have a standard practice of providing longterm financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division Since fiscal 1989 when our financing division was formed we have established a history of collection without concessions on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize new software licenses 91 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery net of any payment discounts from financing transactions We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a nonrecourse basis to thirdparty financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows We account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables We sold 16 billion of our financing receivables to financial institutions during fiscal 2017 and 18 billion during each of fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies Concurrent Transactions Software license agreements sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a threemonth time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure When we acquire goods or services from a customer we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction at terms we consider to be at arms length and settle the purchase in cash We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations in accounting for our acquisitions It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations and are accounted for separately from the business combination A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities assumptions are applied regarding estimated sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made For a given acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a preacquisition contingency nonincome tax related by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 92 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Marketable and NonMarketable Securities In accordance with ASC 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities and based on our intentions regarding these instruments we classify substantially all of our marketable debt and equity securities as availableforsale Marketable debt and equity securities classified as availableforsale are reported at fair value with all unrealized gains losses reflected net of tax in stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets and as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income If we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value we recognize the investment loss in nonoperating income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required Substantially all of our marketable debt and equity investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations We hold investments in certain nonmarketable equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence These equity securities are recorded at cost and included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets If based on the terms of our ownership of these nonmarketable securities we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these nonmarketable securities relate we apply the requirements of ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures to account for such investments Our nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews Fair Values of Financial Instruments We apply the provisions of ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4 Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices For those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends We writeoff a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and trade receivables Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investmentgrade securities Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty creditrelated losses in these contracts is 93 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2017 2016 or 2015 We outsource the design manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the United States Further we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of thirdparty manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these thirdparty manufacturers build our hardware products Any inability of these thirdparty manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons generally six to nine months Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware expenses In addition we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete At the point of loss recognition a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Other Receivables Other receivables represent valueadded tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled 794 million and 816 million at May 31 2017 and 2016 respectively Deferred Sales Commissions We defer sales commission expenses associated with our cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings and recognize the related expenses over the noncancelable term of the related contracts which are typically one to three years Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations Property Plant and Equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value net of accumulated depreciation Depreciation is computed using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives of the assets which range from one to 40 years Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms as appropriate Property plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2017 2016 or 2015 Goodwill Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are 94 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 amortized over their useful lives which generally range from one to 10 years Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable Pursuant to ASC 350 IntangiblesGoodwill and Other we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the twostep impairment test Based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 percent to be less than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test will be performed In the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference We did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2017 or 2016 During fiscal 2015 we recognized a 186 million goodwill impairment loss related to our hardware business Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value If the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2017 2016 or 2015 Derivative Financial Instruments During fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 we used derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks see Note 11 below for additional information We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met ie the instruments are accounted for as hedges The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge each reporting period we record the change in fair value on the effective portion of the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk being hedged For the nonderivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge for our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries the change on account of remeasurement of the effective portion for each reporting period is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets We perform the effectiveness testing of our aforementioned designated hedges on a quarterly basis and the changes in ineffective portions of the derivatives if any are recognized immediately in earnings 95 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 Legal Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated Note 18 below provides additional information regarding certain of our legal contingencies Shipping and Handling Costs Our shipping and handling costs for hardware products sales are included in hardware expenses for all periods presented Foreign Currency We transact business in various foreign currencies In general the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local countrys currency Consequently revenues and expenses of operations outside the United States are translated into US Dollars using weightedaverage exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are translated into US Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet dates The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in nonoperating income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were 152 million 110 million and 157 million in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015

employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation which requires that sharebased payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values Upon adoption of ASU 201609 in fiscal 2017 see Note 1 above we account for forfeitures as they occur For our PSUs we recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the service period for each separately vesting tranche which is generally twelve months as the performance conditions to evaluate attainment of each tranche for each participant are independent of the performance conditions for the other tranches The amount of stockbased compensation expense recorded as of the end of each annual reporting period is based on the actual attainment of performance targets During our interim reporting periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets are reflected in the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU tranche on a cumulative basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered and may cause the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary For our servicebased awards we recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the service period of the award which is generally four years We record deferred tax assets for stockbased compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions

is more likely than not to be realized A twostep approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement We recognize interest and penalties

requires companies to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets ASU 201602 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a modified retrospective basis and earlier adoption is permitted We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 201602 on our consolidated financial statements and we currently expect that most of our operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets upon our adoption of ASU 201602 which will increase our total assets and total liabilities that we report relative to such amounts prior to adoption Revenue Recognition In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU 201409 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August 2015 March 2016 April 2016 May 2016 and December 2016 within ASU 201514 ASU 201608 ASU 201610 ASU 201612 and ASU 201620 respectively ASU 201409 ASU 201514 ASU 201608 ASU 201610 ASU 201612 and ASU 201620 respectively and collectively Topic 606 Topic 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP The core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services Topic 606 defines a fivestep process to achieve this core principle and in doing so it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation among others Topic 606 also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts Topic 606 is effective for us as of either our first quarter of fiscal 2018 or our first quarter of fiscal 2019 using either of two methods 1 retrospective application of Topic 606 to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within Topic 606 or 2 retrospective application of Topic 606 with the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per Topic 606 The accounting for the recognition of costs related to obtaining customer contracts under Topic 606 is significantly different than our current capitalization policy The adoption of Topic 606 will result in additional types of costs that will be capitalized Additionally all amounts capitalized will be amortized over a period longer than our current policy Preliminarily we plan to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 pursuant to the aforementioned adoption method 1 and we do not believe there will be a material impact to our revenues upon adoption We are continuing to evaluate the impact to our revenues related to our pending adoption of Topic 606 and our preliminary assessments are subject to change 2 ACQUISITIONS Fiscal 2017 Acquisitions Acquisition of NetSuite Inc a Related Party On July 28 2016 we entered into an

the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value An assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 103 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities or Level 3 unobservable inputs that are

information We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the US Dollar see Note 11 for additional information In July 2016 we issued 140 billion of senior notes for general corporate purposes which may include stock repurchases payment of cash dividends on our common stock and repayment of indebtedness and future

are typically billed on a per annum basis in advance with corresponding revenues being recognized ratably over the support periods Deferred SaaS PaaS and IaaS revenues generally resulted from customer payments made in advance for our cloudbased offerings that are recognized over the corresponding contractual term Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues

specified enhancements customerspecific acceptance provisions timebased license arrangements and software license transactions that cannot be separated from undelivered consulting or other services 111 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 In connection with our acquisitions we have estimated the fair values of the cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS software license updates and product support and hardware support obligations among others assumed from our acquired companies We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost buildup approach The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS software license updates and product support and hardware deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the postcombination periods 11 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges Interest Rate Swap Agreements In July 2014 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our October 2019 Notes and our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR In July 2013 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our January 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the October 2019 Notes July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes that the interest rate swap agreements pertain to including the notional amounts and maturity dates We have designated the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixedrate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements The changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets The amount of net gain loss attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable noncurrent The periodic interest settlements for the interest rate swap agreements for the October 2019 Notes July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities We do not use any interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes Cash Flow Hedges CrossCurrency Swap Agreements In connection with the issuance of our January 2021 Notes we entered into certain crosscurrency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixedrate Eurodenominated January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to fixedrate US Dollardenominated debt The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in US Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at 16 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 353 We have designated these crosscurrency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815 The critical terms of the crosscurrency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments being hedged and the crosscurrency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes 112 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 We used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our crosscurrency swap agreements The fair values of these crosscurrency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these crosscurrency swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into nonoperating income net in the same period that the carrying value of the Eurodenominated January 2021 Notes is remeasured and the interest expense is recognized The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these crosscurrency swaps if any is recorded immediately to nonoperating income net We evaluate the effectiveness of our crosscurrency swap agreements on a quarterly basis We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2017 2016 or 2015 The cash flows related to the crosscurrency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities We do not use any crosscurrency swap agreements for trading purposes Net Investment Hedge Foreign Currency Borrowings In July 2013 we designated our July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the US Dollar We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedge Under this method for each reporting period the change in the carrying value of the Eurodenominated July 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion if any is recognized in nonoperating income net in our consolidated statements of operations We evaluate the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the beginning of every quarter We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2017 2016 or 2015 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position The statement of operations 113 Table of Contents ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2017 classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is nonoperating income net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses As of May 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 34 billion and 27 billion respectively and the notional amount of forward contracts we held to sell US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 14 billion and 20 billion respectively The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31 2017 and 2016 The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities Net gains or losses related to these forward contracts are included in nonoperating income net The effects of

agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe a third partys intellectual property rights To date we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements Certain of our product sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement Our SaaS PaaS and IaaS agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreement during the service period Our software license and hardware products agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in the applicable program documentation for a period of one year after delivery We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services We occasionally are required for various reasons to enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business including among others guarantees related to taxes import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows In connection with certain litigation we posted certain courtmandated surety bonds with a court and entered into related indemnification agreements with each of the surety bond issuing companies Additional information is

undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately 475 billion and 79 billion respectively If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States or if the other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction At May 31 2017 assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately 151 billion

assets will be realized in the foreseeable future Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is

2016 were 885 million and 765 million respectively Domestically US federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2016 Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process the most significant of which include the deductibility of certain royalty payments transfer pricing extraterritorial income exemptions domestic production activity foreign tax credits and research and development credits taken With all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate we believe that it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2017 the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months by as much as 389 million 336 million net of offsetting tax benefits Our US federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject

Internationally tax authorities for numerous nonUS jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits We believe that it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2017

subject to tax examinations in nonUS jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997 We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits However there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof On July 27 2015 in Altera Corp v Commissioner the US Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement A final decision has yet to be issued by the Tax Court due to other outstanding issues related to the case At this time the US Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stockbased compensation from its regulations We have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries including in particular Australia Brazil India Korea Spain and the United Kingdom where the amounts under controversy are significant In some although not all cases we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary If our estimates of the federal state and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment it could result in a further charge to expense 16 SEGMENT INFORMATION ASC 280 Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker or decisionmaking group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance Our chief operating decision makers CODMs are our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer We are organized by line of business and geographically While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed In recent periods customer demand has increased at a greater rate for cloudbased IT deployment models relative to onpremise IT deployment models Our CODMs view the operating results of our three businesses and allocate resources in a manner that is consistent with the changing market dynamics that we have experienced As a result during fiscal 2017 we updated our operating segments The footnote information below presents the

HewlettPackard Company now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HP filed a complaint in the California Superior Court County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing defamation intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HPs Itaniumbased servers it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd the Hurd Settlement Agreement who is our Chief Executive Officer and was both HPs former chief executive officer and chairman of HPs board of directors HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief Oracle answered the complaint and filed a crosscomplaint which was amended on December 2 2011 The amended crosscomplaint alleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor and had misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap among other claims Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief The court bifurcated the trial and tried HPs causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012 The court issued a final statement of decision on August 28 2012 finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HPs Itaniumbased servers and to port such products at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers the Phase One Ruling A jury trial began on May 23 2016 On June 30 2016 the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and 128 Table of Contents ORACLE

posted certain courtmandated surety bonds with the court in order to proceed with its motion for a new trial and entered into related indemnification agreements with each of the surety bond issuing companies Oracle filed a motion for a new trial on November 14 2016 which was denied Oracle filed its notice of appeal on January 17 2017 specifying that it was appealing the trial courts Phase One Ruling and Phase Two Jury Verdict On February 2 2017 HP filed a notice of appeal of the trial courts denial of prejudgment interest No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations either prior to or subsequent to the Phase One Ruling or Phase Two Jury Verdict We continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HPs claims and we intend to present these defenses to the appellate court Among the arguments we expect to make on appeal are the following the trial court misapplied fundamental principles of contract law and misinterpreted the Hurd Settlement Agreement including by disregarding the context of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and the evidence of the parties mutual intentions that HPs breach of contract claim should fail as a matter of law because HP does not claim and did not prove that Oracle failed to deliver any software under the trial courts interpretation of the contract that awarding HP both damages for breach of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and specific performance of that agreement constitutes an improper double recovery and that the damages award is excessive unsupported by the evidence and contrary to law We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process and the nature of the claims Litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of the appeal process related to this action is uncertain It is possible that the resolution of this action could have a material impact to our future cash flows and results of operations Derivative Litigation On May 3 2017 a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware The derivative suit is brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle purportedly on Oracles behalf against Oracle our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Technology Officer in his capacities as a director officer and an alleged controlling stockholder one of our Chief Executive Officers who is also a director three other directors and Oracle as a nominal defendant Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc NetSuite at an excessive price Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief an order rescinding or reforming the NetSuite transaction unspecified monetary damages including interest and disgorgement of various unspecified profits fees compensation and benefits The defendants are scheduled to respond to this complaint by July 19 2017 While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations Other Litigation We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims either asserted or unasserted which arise in the ordinary course of business including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters individually or in the aggregate will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized if any 129 Table of Contents SCHEDULE II ORACLE CORPORATION VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS in millions Beginning Balance
