His previous experience includes 14 years with Arthur Andersen LLP most recently as a partner Item 1A Risk Factors We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict The following discussion as well as our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 highlights some of these risks The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities Our Oracle Cloud strategy including our Oracle Software as a Service SaaS Platform as a Service PaaS Infrastructure as a Service IaaS and Data as a Service DaaS offerings may adversely affect our revenues and profitability We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via deployment models that best suit their needs including via our cloudbased SaaS PaaS IaaS and DaaS offerings As these business 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements models continue to evolve we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and onpremise license and hardware arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements Customers generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions Consequently any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations This is in contrast to revenues associated with our cloud license and onpremise license arrangements which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses In addition we incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings We have also acquired a number of cloud computing companies and the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient or scalable as anticipated which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services Rapid technological advances changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand customers may not purchase or subscribe to our software hardware or cloud offerings or renew software support hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business In addition we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services including the launch of the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service in fiscal 2018 The Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service offers automation based on machine learning and we have guaranteed among other matters that it will reduce customer downtime to less than 30 minutes a year and that Amazon Data Warehouse customers will see a significant cost reduction if they migrate their workloads to our offering Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly driving innovations in technology but if they fail to operate as anticipated or the Oracle Autonomous Warehouse Cloud Service or our other products do not perform as promised our business and reputation may be harmed In addition our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames there is a delay in market acceptance of new enhanced or acquired product lines or services there are changes in information technology IT trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts we do not timely optimize complementary product lines and services or we fail to adequately integrate support or enhance acquired product lines or services We might experience significant coding manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud license and hardware offerings Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements our cloud license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors that can impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly Errors in our cloud license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function or operate with other cloud license or hardware offerings could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services This includes thirdparty software products or services incorporated into our own If we experience errors or delays in releasing our cloud license or hardware offerings or new versions thereof our sales could be affected and revenues could decline In addition we run Oracles business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks Therefore any flaws could affect our ability to conduct our business operations and the operations of our customers Enterprise customers rely on our cloud license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud license and hardware offerings and related services could expose us to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation which could impact our future sales If our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result our data our customers data or our IT systems are accessed improperly made unavailable or improperly modified our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable our brand and reputation could be damaged the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using our products and services all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions We are in the IT business and our products and services including our Oracle Cloud Services store retrieve manipulate and manage our customers information and data external data as well as our own data We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products services and the internal and external data that we manage At times we encounter attempts by third parties which may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations such as statesponsored organizations nation states and individuals sponsored by them to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities penetrate or bypass our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers partners and suppliers software hardware and cloud offerings networks and systems any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers Computer hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our networks systems products and services exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our networks systems products and services create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service This is also true for thirdparty data products or services incorporated into our own Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer partner employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers partners employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data our customers suppliers or partners data or the IT systems of Oracle our customers suppliers or partners Security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting IT products and businesses Although this is an industrywide problem that affects software and hardware companies generally it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most prominent IT companies and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for and marketing efforts associated with having secure products and services These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of data including personal information and our customers confidential information and data and other external data and host or manage parts of our customers businesses in cloudbased IT environments especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences financial services retail hospitality and the government We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies products services and technologies over the years While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage IT systems change frequently grow more complex over time and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent against such techniques Our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adapters of new technologies However our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge In addition we may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach We could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers or suppliers data other external data or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted or if our products or services are perceived as having security vulnerabilities Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services including our cloud offerings and perceive them to be not secure This could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenue and earnings The costs we would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses These types of security incidents could also lead to loss or destruction of information inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data lawsuits indemnity obligations regulatory investigations and financial penalties and claims and increased legal liability including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring As illustrated by the Spectre and Meltdown threats our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is a security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims customer dissatisfaction reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position Our business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify For example the European Union EU and the United States US formally entered into a new framework in July 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the US This new framework called the Privacy Shield is intended to address shortcomings identified by the Court of Justice of the EU in the previous EUUS Safe Harbor Framework which the Court of Justice invalidated in October 2015 The Privacy Shield and other data transfer mechanisms are currently subject to challenges in European courts which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers to the US or interruption of such transfers In the event any court blocks transfers to or from a particular jurisdiction on the basis that no transfer mechanisms are legally adequate this could give rise to operational interruption in the performance of services for customers and internal processing of employee information regulatory liabilities or reputational harm In addition US and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations in a manner that could significantly impact our ability as well as the ability of our customers partners and data providers to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide This could be true particularly in those jurisdictions where privacy laws or regulators take a broader view of how personal information is defined therefore subjecting the handling of such data to heightened restrictions that may be obstructive to our operations and the operations of our customers partners and data providers This impact may be acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized in country as this imposes financial costs on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdictions not of its choosing and nonstandard operational processes that are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations For example in 2016 the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which became effective in May 2018 The law establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal data Noncompliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of data could greatly increase 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the size of potential fines related to data protection and our cost of providing our products and services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate Although we have implemented contracts policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors partners data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts policies and procedures Additionally public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to provide certain products We make statements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy information provided on our website and press statements Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these public statements or with US federal state or foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations regulating privacy data security or consumer protection public perception standards selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in lost or restricted business proceedings actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation Economic political and market conditions can adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting These include general economic and business conditions overall demand for enterprise cloud license and hardware products and services governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities and general legal regulatory and political developments Macroeconomic developments like the developments associated with the United Kingdoms vote to exit the EU or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic political or market conditions could negatively affect our business operating results financial condition and outlook which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Any general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services In addition international regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and onpremise license hardware and related services and to a lesser extent also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our subscriptionbased cloud offerings If we are unable to compete effectively the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed We face intense competition in all aspects of our business The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge expand or are acquired as technology evolves and as delivery models change Many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications platform and infrastructure technologies including databases middleware products application development tools business applications collaboration products and business intelligence products among others which compete with Oracle applications platform and infrastructure offerings Use of our competitors technologies may influence a customers purchasing decision or create an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize Oracle products and services Our competition may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services at a risk profile that we may not generally find acceptable which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services We could lose 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products add new functionality acquire competitive products reduce prices better execute on their sales and marketing strategies offer more flexible business practices or form strategic alliances with other companies We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense Our hardware business competes with among others 1 systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on our own microprocessors and operating systems and those of our competitors 2 microprocessorchip manufacturers 3 providers of storage products 4 certain industryspecific hardware manufacturers including those serving communications hospitality and retail industries and 5 certain cloud providers that build their own IT infrastructures Our hardware business causes us to compete with certain companies that historically have been partners Some of these competitors may have more experience than we do in managing a hardware business Certain of these competitors also compete very aggressively on price A loss in our competitive position could result in lower revenues or profitability which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecasts for our hardware business We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license hardware and services offerings in particular our IaaS offerings which could reduce our revenues and profitability Our license support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net cloud license and onpremise license fees and net new hardware products fees respectively Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings or support pricing We introduced Oracle Bring Your Own License BYOL to PaaS and Universal Credit Pricing in fiscal 2018 to simplify the way customers purchase and consume our cloud services Oracle BYOL enables customers to maintain their existing software licenses for Oracle PaaS while expanding their platform technology footprint at a discounted price Oracle Universal Credit Pricing provides a flexible model for customers to access Oracle PaaS and IaaS services on demand via a single contract These changes and any future changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy commit to large customer deployments at prices that are unprofitable or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations These practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the US Our international operations include cloud operations cloud software and hardware development manufacturing assembly sales customer support consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers Compliance with international and US laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions These laws and regulations include US laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws foreign currencyrelated regulations anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials market access import export and general trade regulations including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business including the loss of trade privileges Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results Compliance with these laws requires a significant amount of management attention and effort which may divert managements attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded Where circumstances warrant we provide information and report our findings to government authorities but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally including those related to general economic conditions in each country or region fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts to customer demand and our operating results difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation of our net assets in particular our cash assets in that countrys currency regulatory changes including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries political unrest terrorism and the potential for other hostilities common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics practices and conduct policies natural disasters the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding wildfires and increased storm sensitivity longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable overlapping tax regimes public health risks social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks particularly in areas in which we have significant operations and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware business and the sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited a publicly traded company in India and Oracle Corporation Japan a publicly traded company in Japan we are faced with several additional risks including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if these entities were whollyowned subsidiaries Acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction We continue to invest billions of dollars to acquire companies products services and technologies We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include our ongoing business may be disrupted and our managements attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements we may have difficulties 1 managing an acquired companys technologies or lines of business 2 entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions or 3 retaining key personnel from the acquired companies an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected we may impose our business practices or alter gotomarket strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by 1 claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition including among others claims from government agencies terminated employees current or former customers former stockholders or other third parties 2 preexisting contractual relationships of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business 3 unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired companys practices and 4 intellectual property claims or disputes we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes due a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons including if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew cloudbased subscription contracts or software or hardware support contracts if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base if acquired customers do not elect to purchase our technologies due to differing business practices or if contract models of an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies products services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of business and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards architecture controls procedures and policies we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered priced and supported differently which could cause customer confusion and delays we may have higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products or services in general and administrative functions that support new business models or in compliance with associated regulations that are more complicated than we had anticipated we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from or may otherwise have certain limitations restrictions penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis if at all which could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or have other adverse effects on our current business and operations our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash including stock repurchases dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements we may significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease and we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to US generally accepted accounting principles including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions Any failure to offer highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications platform and infrastructure offerings We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services Increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results Any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors Our revenues particularly certain of our cloud license and onpremise license revenues and hardware revenues are difficult to forecast As a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially For our Oracle Cloud Services we may use conversion or renewal rates in our forecasts that differ materially from our actual conversion or renewal rates because this business is continuing to evolve and such rates may be unpredictable For our license business we use a pipeline system a common industry practice to forecast sales and trends in that business Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate A reduction in the conversion rates renewal rates or in the pipeline itself could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations In particular a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rates and renewal rates in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled The conversion rates can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms which can also impede our ability to negotiate execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner In addition for newly acquired companies we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition Conversion rates and renewal rates postacquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies historical conversion rates Differences in conversion rates and renewal rates can also be affected by changes in business practices that we implement in our newly acquired companies These changes may negatively affect customer behavior A substantial portion of our cloud license and onpremise license and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are larger orders Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability The number of large cloud license and onpremise license transactions and to a lesser extent hardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may experience foreign currency gains and losses Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the US Dollar Changes in the values of major foreign currencies particularly the Euro Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the US Dollar can significantly affect our total assets revenues operating results and cash flows which are reported in US Dollars In particular the economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt obligations may cause the value of the Euro to fluctuate relative to the US Dollar Fluctuations in foreign currency rates including the strengthening of the US Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in US Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into US Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currencybased enterprises to purchase In addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the US Generally our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens In addition our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits among other assets are held in foreign currencies In addition we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term which are charged against earnings in the period incurred We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures We may suspend the program from time to time As a part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses A large portion of our consolidated operations are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts For example we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or costeffective to hedge our foreign currency exposures if our hedging efforts are ineffective or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the US Dollar We could incur future losses in emerging market countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationary Our hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline Our hardware business may adversely affect our overall profitability We may not achieve our estimated revenue profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors including our changes in hardware strategies offerings and technologies including the development marketing and sale of our own Oracle Cloud Services which could adversely affect demand for our hardware products our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues and thus has been less profitable than our cloud and license business our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems such as our Oracle Exadata Database Machine and the deemphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products which could adversely affect our hardware revenues because the lower profit products have historically constituted a larger portion of our hardware revenues 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements changes in strategies for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products including the pace at which we offer new versions or next generations of our hardware products and the related impacts from customers that may defer or delay purchases of existing hardware products and wait for these new releases all of which could adversely affect our hardware revenues a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results such as potential writedowns and impairments of our inventories higher warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and license and services businesses and amortization and potential impairment of intangible assets associated with our hardware business the close connection between hardware products which have a finite life and customer demand for related hardware support in which hardware products that approach the end of their useful lives are less likely to have hardware support contracts renewed by customers and we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but 1 operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operating margins than our own 2 have different legacy business practices and gotomarket strategies than our own that we may alter as a part of our integration efforts which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company 3 leverage different platforms or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating or 4 utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquired products within our own manufacturing operations Our hardware offerings are complex products and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity the results of our hardware business will suffer Designing developing manufacturing and introducing new hardware products are complicated processes The development process for our hardware products is uncertain and requires a high level of innovation After the development phase we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware products in sufficient volumes to meet this demand and do so in a costeffective manner Our buildtoorder manufacturing model in which our hardware products generally are not built until after customers place orders may from time to time experience delays in delivering our hardware products to customers in a timely manner These delays could cause our customers to purchase hardware products and services from our competitors We must also manage new hardware product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchases of existing hardware products in anticipation of new hardware product releases It is also possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaws which could delay or prevent the production of the components for which we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers and could also prevent the production of our hardware products or cause our hardware products to be returned recalled or rejected resulting in lost revenues increases in warranty costs or costs related to remediation efforts damage to our reputation penalties and litigation We depend on suppliers to design develop manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price quality technology availability or other business constraints As a result our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages natural disasters political unrest port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience significant shortages delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies parts or components from a particular vendor If we had to find a new supplier for these technologies parts and components hardware product shipments could be delayed which would adversely affect our hardware revenues We could also experience fluctuations in component prices which if unanticipated could negatively affect our hardware business cost structure Additionally we could experience changes in shipping and logistics of our hardware products which could result in fluctuations in prices and negatively impact our hardware margins These factors may make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels in a timely fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware products Therefore we may experience component inventory 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements shortages which may result in production delays or customers choosing to purchase fewer hardware products from us or hardware products from our competitors We negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient technologies and components for our hardware products to meet anticipated customer demand We must also manage our levels of older component inventories used in our hardware products to minimize inventory writeoffs or writedowns If we have excess inventory it may be necessary to writedown the inventory which would adversely affect our operating results If one or more of the risks described above occurs our hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected We are susceptible to thirdparty manufacturing and logistics delays which could result in the loss of sales and customers We outsource the design manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the US Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs product supply and delivery delays as well as the political and economic uncertainties and natural disasters of the international locations where certain of these thirdparty manufacturers have facilities and operations Some countries may raise national security concerns or impose market access restrictions based on location of manufacturing or sourcing Any manufacturing disruption or logistics delays by these third parties could impair our ability to fulfill orders for these hardware products for extended periods of time If we are unable to manage our relationships with these third parties effectively or if these third parties experience delays disruptions capacity constraints regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our hardware products to our customers could be impaired and our hardware business could be harmed We endeavor to continue simplifying our supply chain processes by reducing the number of thirdparty manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these thirdparty manufacturers build our hardware products We therefore have become more dependent on a fewer number of these manufacturing partners and locations If these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timely or costeffective manner if at all If we are required to change thirdparty manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled hardware products deliveries to our customers could be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses all of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business These challenges and risks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware products and related supply chain operations In some cases we may be dependent at least initially on these acquired companies supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these challenges and risks Our cloud and license and hardware indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results Our cloud and license and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers system integratorsimplementers consultants education providers internet service providers network integrators and independent software vendors Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud software and hardware marketing and sales efforts Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants products and services were to decrease There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants If we are not successful we may lose sales opportunities customers and revenues We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights We rely on copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights Despite our efforts these protections may be limited Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property Any 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements patents owned by us may be invalidated circumvented or challenged Any of our pending or future patent applications whether or not being currently challenged may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek if at all In addition the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the US If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive Third parties have claimed and in the future may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights andor breach of license agreement provisions We periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse We expect to continue to receive such claims as we continue to acquire companies and expand into new businesses the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows the use and support of thirdparty code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the industry the volume of issued patents continues to increase and nonpracticing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments Responding to any such claim regardless of its validity could be time consuming costly and result in litigation divert managements time and attention from developing our business require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products require us to release source code to third parties possibly under open source license terms require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers or otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows Our periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce including our hardware employees and direct sales force in response to management changes product changes performance issues change in strategies acquisitions and other internal and external considerations In the past these types of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs increased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities In addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings or may not do so within the expected timeframe These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management including our Chairman of the Board of Directors Chief Technology Officer and founder our Chief Executive Officers other members of our executive team and other key employees In the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel With rare exceptions we do not have longterm employment or noncompetition agreements with our employees Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs When we make adjustments to our workforce we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program In addition changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent Our general compensation program includes restricted stock units performance equity and stock options which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry If our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stockbased compensation which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel Our sales to government clients expose us to business volatility and risks including government budgeting cycles and appropriations procurement regulations governmental policy shifts early termination of contracts audits investigations sanctions and penalties We derive revenues from contracts with the US government state and local governments and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of those contracts Governmental entities are variously pursuing policies that affect our ability to sell our products and services Changes in government procurement policy priorities technology initiatives andor contract award criteria may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector We are also subject to early termination of our contracts Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time without cause For example the US federal government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts at its convenience or for default based on our performance US federal contracts are subject to the congressional approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts Similarly our contracts with US state and local governments foreign governments and their agencies are generally subject to government funding authorizations Contracts may be terminated based upon a lack of appropriated funds There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending as governments continue to face significant deficit reduction pressures This may adversely impact spending on government programs Government contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations If violations of law are found they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all Developing our cloud and license and hardware offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired Accelerated product and service introductions and short life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position However we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the US We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems and processes could cause delays in completing sales providing services including some of our cloud offerings and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back office processes A major earthquake or fire political social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports or operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change such as increased storm severity drought and pandemics that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected Adverse litigation results could affect our business We are subject to various legal proceedings Litigation can be lengthy expensive and disruptive to our operations and can divert our managements attention away from running our core business The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business operating results or financial condition Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities As a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the US and various foreign jurisdictions Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the amount of our tax liabilities including those arising from potential changes in laws in the countries in which we do business and the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities and we are regularly under audit by tax authorities which often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns Any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate Increasingly countries around the world are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations In particular the recently enacted US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the Tax Act significantly changed how corporations are taxed in the United States which has had and we expect will continue to have a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes Due to the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended May 31 2018 The US Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service IRS and other standardssetting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied that is different from our interpretation The Tax Act requires complex computations not previously required or produced and significant judgments and assumptions in the interpretation of the law were made in producing our provisional estimates As we complete our analyses and interpret any additional guidance we may adjust the provisional amounts we have recorded and those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made We also anticipate that uncertainty in the application of the Tax Act to our ongoing operations as well as possible adverse future law changes attributable to changes in the US political environment could have an adverse impact on our future tax rate Other countries also continue to consider enacting new laws including changes in withholding tax regimes and the imposition of taxes targeted at certain technology businesses some of which may be made in response to the Tax Act that could adversely affect us As a part of our income tax structure there are many intercompany transactions and calculations made in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future Although we have negotiated a number of agreements with certain taxing jurisdictions these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing In recent periods transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become increasingly contentious Similarly certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters under current law In addition our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by shifts of earnings from jurisdictions or regimes that have relatively lower statutory tax rates to those in which the rates are relatively higher 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We are also subject to nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions that have uncertain applicability to the businesses in which we are engaged Although we believe that our income and nonincome based tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805 Business Combinations we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and in each case separately from goodwill Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred which is also generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain After we complete an acquisition the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention redeployment or relocation expenses impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets acquired a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities both income tax and nonincome tax related after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period generally up to one year from the acquisition date whichever comes first charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative premerger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities for a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated charges to eliminate certain duplicative premerger activities and charges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition and charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will adversely impact our operating results for the periods in which those costs are incurred Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 included elsewhere in this Annual Report There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness As of May 31 2018 we had an aggregate of 609 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2018 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt Furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase Should we incur future increases in interest expense our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our US federal income tax could be limited which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate In addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs Some of our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state federal and international laws governing protection of the environment proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products human health and safety the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers as well as local testing and labelling requirements Compliance with these environmental and other laws could increase our product design development procurement manufacturing delivery cloud operations and administration costs limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete noncompliant inventory change our sales activities or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability including fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses Regulatory market and competitive pressures regarding the energy intensity and energy mix for our data center operations may also grow The US Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain conflict minerals tantalum tin tungsten and gold in their products Our supply chain is multitiered global and highly complex As a provider of hardware end products we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain Accordingly our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited Our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales Environmental legislation such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances RoHS the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive WEEE Directive and Chinas regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements The cumulative impact of international environmental legislation could be significant Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price The timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us and any announcements by us of acquisitions major transactions or management changes could also affect our stock price Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could adversely affect our stock price Our stock price could also be affected by factors some of which are beyond our control including among others speculation in the press and the analyst community changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors expectations our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources which could adversely affect our business We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value In fiscal 2018 our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling 240 billion The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and even if fully implemented may not enhance longterm stockholder value 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties Our properties consist of owned and leased office facilities for sales support research and development services manufacturing cloud operations and administrative and other functions Our headquarters facility consists of approximately 21 million square feet in Redwood City California substantially all of which we own We also own or lease other facilities for current use consisting of approximately 268 million square feet in various other locations in the United States and abroad Approximately 30 million square feet or 10 of our total owned and leased space is sublet or is being actively marketed

refer to Item 12 in Part III of this Annual Report Stock Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock On December 14 2017 and February 2 2018 we announced that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling 240 billion As of May 31 2018 approximately 178 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt our stock price and economic and market conditions Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b51 plan Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at

43855 41958 24097 1 Our net income and diluted earnings per share were unfavorably impacted by a net charge of 70 billion during fiscal 2018 due to our preliminary assessment of the onetime effects of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the Tax Act The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described below under Impacts of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 2 Total working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during all periods presented and the issuances of longterm senior notes of 100 billion in fiscal 2018 140 billion in fiscal 2017 200 billion in fiscal 2015 and 20 billion and 30 billion in fiscal 2014 Our total assets were also favorably impacted by the issuance of 25 billion of shortterm borrowings in fiscal 2018 and 38 billion of shortterm borrowings in each of fiscal 2017 and 2016 These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments made in all periods presented repayments of certain of our senior notes in fiscal 2018 2017 2016 and 2015 and the repayment of 38 billion of shortterm borrowings in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017 3 Our notes payable and other borrowings which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings current and notes payable and other borrowings noncurrent as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above increased between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2018 primarily due to the fiscal 2018 issuance of longterm senior notes of 100 billion and shortterm borrowings of 25 billion the fiscal 2017 issuance of longterm senior notes of 140 billion and shortterm borrowings of 38 billion the fiscal 2016 issuance of 38 billion of shortterm borrowings the issuances of longterm senior notes of 200 billion in fiscal 2015 and 20 billion and 30 billion

force that is employed by our domestic and international subsidiaries and is positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs We have three businesses cloud and license hardware and services each of which comprises a single operating segment The descriptions set forth below as a part of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align as to how our chief operating decision makers CODMs which include our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer view our operating results and allocate resources Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license line of business which represented 82 80 and 78 of our total revenues in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively markets sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications platform and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings Cloud services and license support revenues include license support revenues which is our largest revenues stream Oracle license support grants rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period as well as technical support assistance Substantially all of our customers opt to purchase license support contracts when they purchase Oracle applications platform andor infrastructure licenses and substantially all customers renew their license support contracts annually in order to continue to benefit from Oracles research and development investments that are utilized as a part of unspecified periodic license updates that may be released and that customers with current license support contracts are entitled to Our license support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the support services are delivered over the contractual terms and cloud services revenues which includes revenues from Oracle Cloud SoftwareasaService SaaS PlatformasaService PaaS and InfrastructureasaService IaaS offerings collectively Oracle Cloud Services which deliver applications platform and infrastructure technologies respectively via cloudbased deployment models that we develop functionality for host manage and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management maintenance and security services for customer cloudbased hybrid IT or other IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term The majority of our Oracle Cloud Services arrangements have durations of 12 to 36 months and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the contract or in the case of usage model contracts as the cloud services are consumed We strive to renew these cloud services contracts when they are eligible for renewal 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cloud license and onpremise license revenues include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications Oracle Database Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java among others which our customers use for cloudbased onpremise and other IT environments Our cloud license and onpremise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized when unrestricted access to the license is granted to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods Cloud license and onpremise license customers have the option to purchase license support contracts as described above Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications platform and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy In recent periods customer demand has increased for our Oracle Cloud Services To address customer demand and enable customer choice we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications platform and infrastructure licenses and license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads We expect these trends to continue Our cloud services revenues growth and our cloud license and onpremise license revenues growth are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings our acquisitions our ability to deliver and renew our cloud services contracts with our existing customers and foreign currency rate fluctuations Our license support revenues growth is primarily influenced by three factors 1 the continuity of substantially all of our license support customer contract base renewing their license support contracts and substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their purchase of a new license 2 the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new licenses and 3 the pricing of new licenses sold Customers do so in order to benefit from Oracles research and development investments that are utilized as a part of unspecified periodic license updates that may be released and that customers with current license support contracts are entitled to On a constant currency basis we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings including the high percentage of customers that purchase and renew their license support contracts continued demand for our cloud license and onpremise license offerings and contributions from our acquisitions We believe all of these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license revenues which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services Our cloud and license business margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud license and onpremise license revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term Hardware Business Our hardware business which represented 10 11 and 13 of our total revenues in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively provides a broad selection of hardware products and hardwarerelated software products including Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage industryspecific hardware operating systems virtualization management and other hardware related software and related hardware support Hardware transactions are generally recognized as revenues upon delivery to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met Our hardware business also offers related hardware support We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements including independent distributors and valueadded resellers Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware support contracts are entered into at the option of the customer are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services including direct materials and labor costs Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict Our hardware revenues cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by among others our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings customer demand for competing offerings such as PaaS and IaaS the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products which have a finite life and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations Services Business Our services business helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications platform and infrastructure technologies We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies extensive experience and broad sets of intellectual property and best practices Our services offerings include consulting services advanced support services and education services and represented 8 of our total revenues in fiscal 2018 and 9 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2017 and 2016 Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses Our services revenues are impacted by among others our strategy for and the competitive position of our services customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the associated services for these offerings our strategic emphasis on growing our cloud revenues certain of our acquisitions general economic conditions governmental budgetary constraints personnel reductions in our customers IT departments and tighter controls over discretionary spending Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy In recent years we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies products services and technologies including NetSuite in fiscal 2017 We expect to continue to acquire companies products services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings operating margin cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Codification ASC and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC GAAP as set forth within the ASC requires us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent that there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our financial statements will be affected The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include Revenue Recognition Business Combinations Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments Accounting for Income Taxes and Legal and Other Contingencies In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include cloud and license revenues which include the sale of cloud services and license support and cloud license and onpremise licenses which represent licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and onpremise deployments hardware revenues which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage industryspecific hardware and hardware support revenues and services revenues which are earned from providing cloud license and hardwarerelated services including consulting advanced customer support and education services Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services Offerings Hardware Products Hardware Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Elements Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables including our cloud services offerings hardware products hardware support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 60525 Revenue Recognition MultipleElement Arrangements and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud services revenues hardware products revenues hardware support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 we deliver the products or services 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met Revenues for our cloud services offerings sold on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers Revenues for cloud services offerings sold on a usage basis are generally recognized as the customer consumes the service provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenues from the sale of hardware products are generally recognized upon delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements which is typically one year provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsCloud Services Offerings Hardware Products Hardware Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Arrangements We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements Each element within a nonsoftware multipleelement arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer Further our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement or in the case of our cloud services offerings we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud services subscription For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements For our nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vendorspecific objective evidence VSOE if available thirdparty evidence TPE if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available a description as to how we determine VSOE TPE and ESP is provided below If a tangible hardware product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the products essential functionality and if so the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the selling price hierarchy We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions When possible we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and OnPremise License and License Related Services Software Elements The basis for our cloud license and onpremise license revenues and related services revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985605 SoftwareRevenue Recognition We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud license and onpremise license revenues and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying license we recognize cloud license and onpremise license revenues when 1 we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software 2 we deliver the products 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties and 4 collection is probable Revenues that are not recognized at the time of license sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are generally recognized when those conditions are subsequently met The vast majority of our cloud license and onpremise license arrangements include license support contracts which are entered into at the customers option We recognize the related fees ratably over the term of the arrangement typically one year License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and onpremise license fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term Substantially all of our customers renew their license support contracts annually Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsCloud License and OnPremise License Support and Related Services Software Arrangements We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase cloud licenses and onpremise licenses license support and related services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as software related multipleelement arrangements For those software related multipleelement arrangements we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of cloud license and onpremise license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985605 Under the residual method if VSOE exists for undelivered elements in a multipleelement arrangement VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the license Where VSOE does not exist for the undelivered element in such arrangement no revenue is recognized until the earlier of the point in time at which 1 VSOE has been established for such element or 2 the element that does not have VSOE has been delivered Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsArrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multipleelement arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including cloud licenses and onpremise licenses license support cloud services offerings hardware products hardware support consulting advanced customer support services and education In such arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and the nonsoftware group of elements We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985605 and our policies as described above In addition we allocate the consideration within the nonsoftware group to each respective element within that group based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception as described above After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and nonsoftware group of elements we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above and below Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our cloud license and onpremise license arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from cloud license and onpremise license revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985605 The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of services from other vendors timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the license fee Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions then cloud license and onpremise license revenues andor hardware products revenues including the costs of hardware products are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions when such provisions are required by law to determine the probability of possible cancellation We consider multiple factors including the history with the customer in similar transactions the essential use of the license or hardware products and the planning budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenues for such arrangements once all of the criteria described above have been met If such a determination cannot be made revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity for such arrangements We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met Our standard payment terms are net 30 days However payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed We evaluate nonstandard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements based upon similarity of customers products and arrangement economics and if so generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include shortterm payment terms we have a standard practice of providing longterm financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division Since fiscal 1989 when our financing division was formed we have established a history of collection without concessions on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize cloud license and onpremise license revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery net of any payment discounts from financing transactions We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a nonrecourse basis to thirdparty financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows We account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies Concurrent Transactions Cloud license and onpremise license agreements sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a common period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure When we acquire goods or services from a customer we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction at terms we consider to be at arms length and settle the purchase in cash We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations in accounting for our acquisitions It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements goodwill Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets contractual obligations assumed preacquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration where applicable Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results We estimate the fair values of our cloud services and license support and hardware obligations assumed as part of an acquisition The estimated fair values of these performance obligations are determined utilizing a cost buildup approach The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling these assumed obligations plus a normal profit margin The estimated costs to fulfill the assumed obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services including the correction of any errors in the products acquired The sum of these costs and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the performance obligations We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs Profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the performance obligations prior to the acquisition date We also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition As a result of our fair value estimates for these obligations we did not recognize certain cloud services and license support revenue amounts and hardware revenue amounts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for further discussion To the extent customers to which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective contracts renewal periods In connection with a business combination or other strategic initiative we may estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management Restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs Restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management but may be refined in subsequent periods We account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination pursuant to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities assumptions are applied regarding estimated sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made For a given acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a preacquisition contingency nonincome tax related by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 IntangiblesGoodwill and Other According to ASC 350 we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting units goodwill for impairment or we can directly perform the quantitative impairment test Should the qualitative assessment be used for any given fiscal year qualitative factors to consider include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerations macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed otherwise no further testing is required For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill impairment is recognized for the difference limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting unit Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables We base our fair value estimates on assumptions which we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain Actual future results may differ from those estimates In addition we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units Our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis which was performed on March 1 2018 did not result in a goodwill impairment charge nor did we recognize an impairment charge in fiscal 2017 or 2016 We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate If the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective They can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts Although we believe that the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision In the ordinary course of a global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements among related entities the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made On December 22 2017 the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the Tax Act was signed into law The net expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act has been accounted for during fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118 Subsequent adjustments if any will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified The provisional estimates incorporate among other factors assumptions made based on interpretations of the Tax Act and existing tax laws and a range of historical and forecasted financial and taxspecific facts and information including without limitation the amount of cash and other specified assets anticipated to be held by the companys foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates of deferred tax balances during interim periods pending finalization of those balances We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located We consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time We record deferred tax assets for stockbased compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stockbased awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized to our consolidated statements of operations in the period that a restricted stockbased award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfallwindfall relative to the deferred tax asset established recorded as a discrete detrimentbenefit to our provision for income taxes in this period Such detrimentbenefit can materially impact our reported effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 and prospective periods We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known which can materially impact our effective tax rate The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740 Income Taxes which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement Although we believe that 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit judicial rulings and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties In addition as a part of our accounting for business combinations intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure however deferred taxes have been recorded for nondeductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations We have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable Because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made As additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Results of Operations Impacts of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods and of our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31 2018 relative to May 31 2017 was impacted by the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the Tax Act which was signed into law on December 22 2017 Effective January 1 2018 the Tax Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 creates a quasiterritorial tax system that a generally allows among other provisions companies to repatriate certain foreign source earnings without incurring additional US income tax for such earnings generated after December 31 2017 and b generally requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings generated prior to December 31 2017 that in substantial part were previously tax deferred creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings limits deductibility of certain future compensation arrangements to certain highly compensated employees and provides tax incentives for the exportation of US products to foreign jurisdictions and for the purchase of qualifying capital equipment among other provisions Because we have a May 31 fiscal year end our fiscal 2018 blended US federal statutory tax rate was approximately 29 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During fiscal 2018 our provision for income taxes increased and our net income decreased primarily as a result of the following items related to the enactment of the Tax Act 78 billion of income tax expense which we refined by a 166 million increase as of May 31 2018 from our initial estimate made in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118 SAB 118 related to the application of the onetime transition tax to certain foreign subsidiary earnings that were generated prior to December 31 2017 and for which such expense was substantially recorded to noncurrent income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet and corresponds to the amount we currently expect to periodically settle over an eight year period as provided by the Tax Act partially offset by 820 million of income tax benefit which we refined by a 76 million increase as of May 31 2018 from our initial estimate made in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 in accordance with SAB 118 related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future and the net favorable impacts of the Tax Act on our tax profile and effective tax rate beginning on January 1 2018 which we generally expect will continue into future periods The net expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act has been accounted for during fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to SAB 118 Subsequent adjustments if any will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified The provisional estimates incorporate among other factors assumptions made based on interpretations of the Tax Act and existing tax laws and a range of historical financial and taxspecific facts and information including among other items the amount of cash and other specified assets and liabilities of the company and its foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates of deferred tax balances pending finalization of those balances We expect the enactment of the Tax Act to generally provide greater flexibility for us to access and utilize our cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries as of January 1 2018 as well as for prospective assets generated by these foreign subsidiaries future earnings and profits We believe we have sufficient cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances as well as access to other capital resources if required to settle the 78 billion onetime transition tax described above Impacts of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was impacted by our recent acquisitions including our acquisition of NetSuite during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the oneyear period subsequent to the acquisition date to the growth in certain of our businesses revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations When material we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations andor were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented We caution readers that while pre and postacquisition comparisons as well as any quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies including our sales force integration efforts We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated the relative mix of products and services sold would have been different and 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the amounts shown as cloud services and license support deferred revenues and hardware deferred revenues in our Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges presented below are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information In our results of operations discussion below we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues total consolidated expenses and total consolidated operating margin all of which are presented on a GAAP basis We also present a GAAPbased discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statement of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses In addition we discuss below the results of each our three businessescloud and license hardware and serviceswhich are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280 Segment Reporting The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each business in the discussion below Consistent with our internal management reporting processes the below operating segment presentation includes revenues adjustments related to cloud services and license support contracts and hardware contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements Refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for additional discussion of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as

administrative expenses stockbased compensation expenses amortization of intangible assets certain other expense allocations acquisition related and other expenses restructuring expenses interest expense nonoperating income net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items andor it is impractical to do so Refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before provision of income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses revenues and expenses As a result each businesses revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the US Dollar against major international currencies In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure To present this information current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US Dollars are converted into US Dollars at constant exchange rates ie the rates in effect on May 31 2017 which was the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods For example if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 10 million Euros from products sold on May 31 2018 and 2017 our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of 116 million in fiscal 2018 using 116 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period and 111 million in fiscal 2017 using 111 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period The constant currency presentation 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements however would translate the fiscal 2018 results using the fiscal 2017 exchange rate and indicate in this example no change in revenues during the period In each of the tables below we present the percent change based on actual unrounded

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations our total revenues increased in fiscal 2018 primarily due to growth in our cloud and license revenues partially offset by decreases in our hardware revenues and services revenues The constant currency increase in our cloud and license revenues during fiscal 2018 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications platform and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related contracts to continue to gain access to our latest technology and support services To a lesser extent our cloud and license revenues also increased due to revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions The constant currency decrease in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2018 was due to the reduction in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud and license technologies The constant currency decrease in our services revenues during fiscal 2018 was attributable to declines in our education and advanced customer support services revenues In constant currency the Americas EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 78 10 and 12 respectively to the growth in our fiscal 2018 total revenues Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher cloud services and license support expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increases in our revenues higher sales and marketing expenses related to our cloud and license business increased stockbased compensation expenses higher general and administrative expenses increased restructuring expenses and higher intangible asset amortization These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by certain expense decreases in fiscal 2018 which primarily consisted of lower research and development expenses primarily related to lower 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements employee expenses and lower hardware products costs and a related decrease in hardware sales and marketing costs both of which aligned to lower hardware revenues In constant currency our total operating margin increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenues and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues remained flat Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations our total revenues increased in fiscal 2017 due to growth in our cloud and license revenues and our services revenues partially offset by a decrease in our hardware revenues The constant currency increases in our cloud and license revenues during fiscal 2017 and constant currency decreases in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2017 were primarily attributable to similar reasons as noted above for the fiscal 2018 changes of each The constant currency services revenues increase during fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to certain acquisitions In constant currency the Americas region contributed 54 the EMEA region contributed 24 and the Asia Pacific region contributed 22 to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2017 Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate variations our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2017 relative to the prior year period due to higher sales and marketing and research and development expenses which were primarily attributable to increased headcount and increased stockbased compensation expenses and higher cloud services and license support expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our revenues These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by certain expense decreases in fiscal 2017 primarily lower hardware expenses due to similar reasons noted for the fiscal 2018 decrease above and lower intangible asset amortization in fiscal 2017 due to certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized In constant currency our total operating margin increased in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in our total revenues while total operating margin as a percentage of revenues was flat Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future You should review the introduction under Impact of Acquisitions above for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre and postacquisition

estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts and hardware contracts assumed Due to our application of business combination accounting rules we did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts and hardware revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective contracts renewal periods 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2 Certain acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related contractual terms Business combination accounting rules generally require us to eliminate these acquired capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our postcombination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these acquired deferred sales commissions balances This adjustment is intended to include and thus reflect the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented 3 Represents the amortization of intangible assets substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions As of May 31 2018 estimated future amortization related to

stockbased awards 7 For fiscal 2018 the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after adjusting for the effects of the items within the table above excluding income tax reform see footnote 8 below resulted in an effective tax rate of 211 which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statements of operations primarily due to the exclusion of stockbased compensation expense and acquisition related items including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets The income tax effects presented for fiscal 2017 and 2016 were calculated reflecting effective tax rates of 228 and 232 respectively which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations primarily due to the net tax effects of acquisition related items including the tax effects of amortization of intangible assets and the net tax effects of stockbased compensation 8 The income tax reform adjustments for fiscal 2018 presented in the table above were due to the our enactment of the Tax Act refer to Impacts of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 above for additional discussion which increased our

fiscal 2016 The aforementioned favorable movements in nonoperating income net during fiscal 2017 were partially offset by higher foreign currency losses net during fiscal 2017 Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates In fiscal 2018 the Tax Act was signed into law The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described above under Impacts of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal 2018 presented varied from the 21 US statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act due primarily to the January 1 2018 effective date of the Tax Act the impacts of the Tax Act upon adoption state taxes the US research and development tax credit settlements with tax authorities the tax effects of stockbased compensation and the US domestic production activity deduction Prior to the January 1 2018 effective date of the Tax Act our provision for income taxes historically differed from the tax computed at the previous US federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations state taxes the US research and development tax credit settlements with tax authorities the tax effects of stockbased compensation and the US domestic production activity deduction Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations by adverse rulings in tax related litigation or by shortfalls in stockbased compensation realized by employees relative to stockbased compensation that

unfavorable shift in jurisdiction mix of earnings in fiscal 2018 and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements with tax authorities and other events during fiscal 2018 These unfavorable impacts to our provision for income taxes were partially offset by higher fiscal 2018 realized excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation expense Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 decreased relative to fiscal 2016 primarily due to the favorable impact of excess tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2017 that related to stockbased

our common stock the repayment of 98 billion of borrowings payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act on January 1 2018 we expect greater flexibility in accessing and utilizing our cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries as well as prospective assets generated by these foreign subsidiaries future earnings and profits We believe we have sufficient cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and access to additional capital resources if required to settle the 78 billion onetime transition tax described under Impacts of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 above The amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance

beginning of the contracts terms which are generally one year in length Over the course of a fiscal year we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses cloud services hardware offerings and services Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products taxes and leased facilities Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for the

and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors Swap Agreements In May 2018 we entered into certain crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk associated with our 750 million of 3125 senior notes due July 2025 July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixedrate Euro denominated July 2025 Notes including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to variablerate US Dollar denominated debt The economic effect of the swap agreement was to eliminate the uncertainty of the principal balance in US Dollars associated with the July 2025 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the July 2025 Notes at 868 million and modify the related fixed interest obligations so that the interest payable on these notes became variable based on LIBOR As of May 31 2018 our July 2025 Notes had an effective interest rate of 517

associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the payment We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture subassemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon leadtimes andor commercially standard leadtimes for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way As of May 31 2018 we had 66 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits including related interest and penalties recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2019 We are involved in claims and legal proceedings All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which are out of our control Notes 14 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information regarding these contingencies We believe that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements including the 78 billion onetime transition tax described under Impacts of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 above In addition we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities OffBalance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Selected Quarterly Financial Data Quarterly revenues expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors including the structure of sales force incentive compensation plans In addition our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer These seasonal factors are common in the technology industry These factors have historically caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year Similarly the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues in particular our cloud and license business and hardware business as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2019 The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters We believe that all necessary adjustments which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from annual data due to rounding Fiscal 2018 Quarter Ended Unaudited in millions except

of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders We recognize that restricted stockbased awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stockbased awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages Consistent with these dual goals our cumulative potential dilution since June 1 2015 has been a weightedaverage annualized rate of 17 per year The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stockbased awards or stock options granted and assumed net of restricted stockbased awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company divided by the weightedaverage outstanding shares during the calculation period This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stockbased awards vest and stock options are exercised Of the outstanding stock options at May 31 2018 which generally have a tenyear exercise period approximately 19 have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date In recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stockbased compensation program However we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions to pay dividends to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes At May 31 2018 the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stockbased awards and 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements unexercised stock options regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the

employees all stockbased award grants to executive officers and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62500 or greater Each member of a separate executive officer committee referred to as the Plan Committee was allocated a fiscal 2018 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization subject to certain limitations established by

consolidated financial statements if any see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 673 billion and 661 billion as of May 31 2018 and 2017 respectively Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investmentgrade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investmentgrade ratings criteria which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks In addition as of May 31 2018 substantially all of our marketable securities were high quality with approximately 26 having maturity dates within one year and 74 having maturity dates within one to five years a description of our marketable securities held is included in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and Liquidity and Capital Resources above We held a mix of both fixed and floatingrate debt securities Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted as interest rates increase 65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall Due in part to these factors our future investment income may vary due to changes in interest rates or we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary The fair values of our fixedrate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of May 31 2018 and 2017 we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by 308 million and 348 million respectively Substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as availableforsale We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities For fiscal 2018 and 2017 total interest income was 12 billion and 802 million respectively with our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 173 and 147 respectively on a worldwide basis Interest Expense Risk Interest Expense Risk Interest Rate Swap Agreements and CrossCurrency Interest Rate Swap Agreements Our total borrowings were 609 billion as of May 31 2018 consisting of 569 billion of fixedrate borrowings 12 billion of floatingrate borrowings FloatingRate Notes and 28 billion of other borrowings primarily under the 2018 Credit Agreements We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our 15 billion of 2375 senior notes due January 2019 January 2019 Notes our 20 billion of 225 senior notes due October 2019 October 2019 Notes our 15 billion of 280 senior notes due July 2021 July 2021 Notes and our April 2038 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR We have also entered into crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixedrate Euro denominated debt including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to variablerate US Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the January 2019 Notes October 2019 Notes July 2021 Notes April 2038 Notes and July 2025 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to including the notional amounts and maturity dates We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes We are accounting for these swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 The fair values of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31 2018 and 2017 were a 26 million net loss and a 40 million gain respectively We estimate that the changes in the fair values of these swap agreements during fiscal 2018 and 2017 were primarily attributable to an increase in forward interest rate prices If LIBORbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31 2018 and 2017 the change would have decreased the fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by 315 million and 153 million respectively By issuing the FloatingRate Notes and by entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates As of May 31 2018 and 2017 if LIBORbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately 86 million and 73 million respectively as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floatingrate borrowings Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction RiskForeign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations Given the short duration of the forward contracts amounts recorded generally are not significant The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is nonoperating income net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 34 billion as of each of May 31 2018 and 2017 and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 14 billion as of each of May 31 2018 and 2017 The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31 2018 and 2017 Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in nonoperating income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were 74 million 152 million and 110 million in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future the amounts and timing of which are unknown Foreign Currency Translation RiskImpact on Cash Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into US Dollars In particular the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report As the US Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2018 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in US Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31 2018 increased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate from May 31 2017 As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in US Dollars was an increase of 57 million for fiscal 2018 and decreases of 86 million and 115 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the US Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10 as of May 31 2018 and May 31 2017 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in US Dollars would have decreased by approximately 555 million and 518 million respectively assuming constant foreign currency cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 67 Table of Contents Index to

Rules 13a15f and 15d15f Under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2018 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commissions 2013 framework Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP Based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31 2018 We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2018 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of Exchange Act Rules 13a15 or 15d15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level However our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud A control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met Further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake Additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate Because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected Item 9B Other Information None 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements PART III Item 10 Directors Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Pursuant to General

Oracle Cloud SaaS PaaS and IaaS offerings collectively Oracle Cloud Services integrate the software hardware and services on customers behalf in IT environments that we deploy support and manage for the customer We offer our customers the option to deploy our comprehensive set of cloud offerings including Oracle Cloud Services or to purchase our software and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloudbased or onpremise IT environments Customers that purchase our software products may elect to purchase license support contracts which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications platform and infrastructure technologies Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977 Basis of Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracles stockholders for all periods presented The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have been included as a component of nonoperating income net in our consolidated statements of operations Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated Certain other prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues operating income or net income In fiscal 2018 we adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU No 201704 IntangiblesGoodwill and Other Topic 350 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment ASU 201704 The ASU simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test Under the legacy guidance Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test required entities to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit The carrying value in excess of the implied fair value was recognized as goodwill impairment Under the new standard goodwill impairment is recognized as the carrying value in excess of the reporting units fair value limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit ASU 201704 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements Impacts of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year periods and of our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31 2018 relative to May 31 2017 was impacted by the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the Tax Act which was signed into law on December 22 2017 Effective January 1 2018 the Tax Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 creates a quasiterritorial tax 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 system that a generally allows among other provisions companies to repatriate certain foreign source earnings without incurring additional US income tax for such earnings generated after December 31 2017 and b generally requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings generated prior to December 31 2017 that in substantial part were previously tax deferred creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings limits deductibility of certain future compensation arrangements to certain highly compensated employees and provides tax incentives for the exportation of US products to foreign jurisdictions and for the purchase of qualifying capital equipment among other provisions Because we have a May 31 fiscal year end our fiscal 2018 blended US federal statutory tax rate was approximately 29 During fiscal 2018 our provision for income taxes increased and our net income decreased primarily as a result of the following items related to the enactment of the Tax Act 78 billion of income tax expense which we refined by a 166 million increase as of May 31 2018 from our initial estimate made in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 in accordance with US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118 SAB 118 related to the application of the onetime transition tax to certain foreign subsidiary earnings that were generated prior to December 31 2017 and for which such expense was substantially recorded to noncurrent income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet and corresponds to the amount we currently expect to periodically settle over an eight year period as provided by the Tax Act partially offset by 820 million of income tax benefit which we refined by a 76 million increase as of May 31 2018 from our initial estimate made in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 in accordance with SAB 118 related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future and the net favorable impacts of the Tax Act on our tax profile and effective tax rate beginning on January 1 2018 which we generally expect will continue into future periods The net expense related to the enactment of the Tax Act has been accounted for during fiscal 2018 based on provisional estimates pursuant to SAB 118 Subsequent adjustments if any will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified The provisional estimates incorporate among other factors assumptions made based on interpretations of the Tax Act and existing tax laws and a range of historical financial and taxspecific facts and information including among other items the amount of cash and other specified assets and liabilities of the company and its foreign subsidiaries on relevant dates and estimates of deferred tax balances pending finalization of those balances Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent that there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its 80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 application There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include cloud and license revenues which include the sale of cloud services and license support and cloud license and onpremise licenses which represent licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and onpremise deployments hardware revenues which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems servers and storage products and industryspecific hardware and hardware support revenues and services revenues which are earned from providing cloud license and hardwarerelated services including consulting advanced customer support and education services Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services Offerings Hardware Products Hardware Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Elements Our revenue recognition policy for nonsoftware deliverables including our cloud services offerings hardware products hardware support and related services is based upon the accounting guidance contained in ASC 60525 Revenue Recognition MultipleElement Arrangements and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud services revenues hardware products revenues hardware support and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period Revenues from the sales of our nonsoftware elements are recognized when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 we deliver the products or services 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection is reasonably assured Revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met Revenues for our cloud services offerings sold on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date the service is made available to customers Revenues for cloud services offerings sold on a usage basis are generally recognized as the customer consumes the service provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Revenues from the sale of hardware products are generally recognized upon delivery of the hardware product to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied Hardware support contracts are entered into at the customers option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements which is typically one year provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsCloud Services Offerings Hardware Products Hardware Support and Related Services Nonsoftware Arrangements We enter into arrangements with customers that purchase nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements Each element within a nonsoftware multipleelement arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer Further our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products 81 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 Where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition For those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenues over the contractual period of the arrangement or in the case of our cloud services offerings we generally recognize revenues over the contractual term of the cloud services subscription For the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line items within our consolidated statements of operations based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling prices of such elements For our nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception The selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vendorspecific objective evidence VSOE if available thirdparty evidence TPE if VSOE is not available or estimated selling price ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available a description as to how we determine VSOE TPE and ESP is provided below If a tangible hardware product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware product and the software work together to deliver the products essential functionality and if so the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable The total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the selling price hierarchy We limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions When possible we establish VSOE of selling price for deliverables in software and nonsoftware multipleelement arrangements using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately TPE is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE does not exist we determine ESP for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and OnPremise License and License Related Services Software Elements The basis for our cloud license and onpremise license revenues and related services revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in ASC 985605 SoftwareRevenue Recognition We exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of cloud license and onpremise license revenues and related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period For license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying license we recognize cloud license and onpremise license revenues when 1 we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software 2 we deliver the products 3 the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties and 4 collection is probable Revenues that are not recognized at the time of license sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are generally recognized when those conditions are subsequently met The vast majority of our cloud license and onpremise license arrangements include license support contracts which are entered into at the customers option We recognize the related fees ratably over the term of the arrangement typically one year License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and 82 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 onpremise license fees and are generally invoiced in full at the beginning of the support term Substantially all of our customers renew their license support contracts annually Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsCloud License and OnPremise License Support and Related Services Software Arrangements We often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase cloud licenses and onpremise licenses license support and related services from us at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to as software related multipleelement arrangements For those software related multipleelement arrangements we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of cloud license and onpremise license revenues to be recognized pursuant to ASC 985605 Under the residual method if VSOE exists for undelivered elements in a multipleelement arrangement VSOE of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration generally recognized upon delivery of the license Where VSOE does not exist for the undelivered element in such arrangement no revenue is recognized until the earlier of the point in time at which 1 VSOE has been established for such element or 2 the element that does not have VSOE has been delivered Revenue Recognition for MultipleElement ArrangementsArrangements with Software and Nonsoftware Elements We also enter into multipleelement arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including cloud licenses and onpremise licenses license support cloud services offerings hardware products hardware support consulting advanced customer support services and education In such arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and the nonsoftware group of elements We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985605 and our policies as described above In addition we allocate the consideration within the nonsoftware group to each respective element within that group based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangements inception as described above After the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the software group of elements and nonsoftware group of elements we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above and below Other Revenue Recognition Policies Applicable to Software and Nonsoftware Elements Many of our cloud license and onpremise license arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business Consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from cloud license and onpremise license revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in ASC 985605 The more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of services from other vendors timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the license fee Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed If an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions then cloud license and onpremise license revenues andor hardware products revenues including the costs of hardware products are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentageofcompletion or completedcontract method We also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions when such provisions are required by law to determine the probability of possible 83 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 cancellation We consider multiple factors including the history with the customer in similar transactions the essential use of the license or hardware products and the planning budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity If we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenues for such arrangements once all of the criteria described above have been met If such a determination cannot be made revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity for such arrangements We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met Our standard payment terms are net 30 days However payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed We evaluate nonstandard payment terms based on whether we have successful collection history on comparable arrangements based upon similarity of customers products and arrangement economics and if so generally conclude such payment terms are fixed and determinable and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition While most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include shortterm payment terms we have a standard practice of providing longterm financing to creditworthy customers primarily through our financing division Since fiscal 1989 when our financing division was formed we have established a history of collection without concessions on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met we recognize cloud license and onpremise license revenues and hardware products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery net of any payment discounts from financing transactions We have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a nonrecourse basis to thirdparty financing institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows We account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables Our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies Concurrent Transactions License agreements sales of hardware or sales of services that occur within a common time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure When we acquire goods or services from a customer we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction at terms we consider to be at arms length and settle the purchase in cash We recognize revenues from Concurrent Transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations in accounting for our acquisitions ASC 805 requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 84 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations and are accounted for separately from the business combination A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities assumptions are applied regarding estimated sublease payments to be received which can differ materially from actual results This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made For a given acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a preacquisition contingency nonincome tax related by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Marketable and NonMarketable Securities In accordance with ASC 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities and based on our intentions regarding these instruments we classify substantially all of our marketable debt and equity securities as availableforsale Marketable debt and equity securities classified as availableforsale are reported at fair value with all unrealized gains losses reflected net of tax in stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets and as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income If we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value we recognize the investment loss in nonoperating income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required Substantially all of our marketable debt and equity investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations We hold investments in certain nonmarketable equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence These equity securities are recorded at cost and included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets If based on the terms of our ownership of these nonmarketable securities we determine that we exercise significant influence on the entity to which these nonmarketable securities relate we apply the requirements of ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures to account for such investments Our nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews 85 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 Fair Values of Financial Instruments We apply the provisions of ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4 Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices For those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends We writeoff a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and trade receivables Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investmentgrade securities Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty creditrelated losses in these contracts is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of these contracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 We outsource the manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the United States Further we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of thirdparty manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these thirdparty manufacturers build our hardware products Any inability of these thirdparty manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons generally six to nine months Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware expenses In addition we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete At the point of loss recognition a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled 398 million and 300 million at May 31

periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 Goodwill Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives which generally range from one to 10 years Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable When goodwill is assessed for impairment we have the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment optional assessment prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test Should the optional assessment be used for any given fiscal year qualitative factors to consider include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerations macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed Otherwise no further testing is required For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis future economic and market conditions and market comparable of peer companies among others If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit impairment is recognized for the difference limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting unit We did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate Recoverability of indefinite lived 87 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value If the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 Derivative Financial Instruments During fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 we used derivative and nonderivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks see Note 10 below for additional information We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met ie the instruments are accounted for as hedges The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge each reporting period we record the change in fair value on the effective portion of the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings to offset the earnings impact that is attributable to the risk being hedged For the nonderivative financial instrument that was designated as a net investment hedge for our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries the change on account of remeasurement of the effective portion for each reporting period was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets until the net investment is sold at which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to nonoperating income net We perform the effectiveness testing of our aforementioned designated hedges on a quarterly basis and material changes in ineffective portions of the derivatives if any are recognized immediately in earnings Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure Descriptions of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination are provided under Business Combinations above For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination

compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values We account for forfeitures of stockbased awards as they occur For our servicebased stock awards we recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the service period of the award which is generally four years For our PSUs and PSOs we recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the longer of the derived explicit or implicit service period which is the period of time expected for the performance condition to be satisfied During our interim and annual reporting periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods may cause the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of shares that are expected to vest are reflected in the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU or PSO tranche on a cumulative catch up basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered Changes in estimate of the implicit service period are recognized prospectively We record deferred tax assets for stockbased compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stockbased awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized in the

the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation among others Topic 606 also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining

value measurements in accordance with ASC 820 ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance 94 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value An assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data

other services In connection with our acquisitions we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support and hardware obligations among others assumed from our acquired companies We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost buildup approach The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud services and license support and hardware deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the postcombination periods 10 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value HedgesInterest Rate Swap Agreements and CrossCurrency Interest Rate Swap Agreements In May 2018 we entered into certain crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixedrate Euro denominated 2025 Notes including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to variablerate US Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR In April 2018 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our April 2038 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR In July 2014 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our October 2019 Notes and our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR In July 2013 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our January 2019 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2025 Notes April 2038 Notes October 2019 Notes July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to including the notional amounts and maturity dates We have designated the aforementioned swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 These transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of certain of our fixedrate borrowings due to benchmark interest rate movements The changes in fair values of these swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets The amount of net gain loss attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable noncurrent The periodic interest settlements for the swap agreements for the July 2025 Notes April 2038 Notes October 2019 Notes July 2021 Notes and the January 2019 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities We do not use any swap agreements for trading purposes Cash Flow Hedges CrossCurrency Swap Agreements In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes we entered into certain crosscurrency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixedrate Eurodenominated January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at 103 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 maturity to fixedrate US Dollardenominated debt The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in US Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at 16 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 353 We have designated these crosscurrency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815 The critical terms of the crosscurrency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments being hedged and the crosscurrency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes We used the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of our crosscurrency swap agreements The fair values of these crosscurrency swap agreements are recognized as other assets or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these crosscurrency swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into nonoperating income net in the same period that the carrying values of the Eurodenominated January 2021 Notes are remeasured and the interest expense is recognized The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these crosscurrency swaps if any are recorded immediately to nonoperating income net We evaluate the effectiveness of our crosscurrency swap agreements on a quarterly basis We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 The cash flows related to the crosscurrency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities We do not use any crosscurrency swap agreements for trading purposes Net Investment Hedge Foreign Currency Borrowings In July 2013 we designated our July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the US Dollar We used the spot method to measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedge Under this method for each reporting period the change in the carrying value of the Eurodenominated July 2025 Notes due to remeasurement of the effective portion is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and the remaining change in the carrying value of the ineffective portion if any was recognized in nonoperating income net in our consolidated statements of operations We evaluated the effectiveness of our net investment hedge at the beginning of every quarter We did not record any ineffectiveness for fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we dedesignated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge and as noted above we entered into crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixedrate Euro denominated debt including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to variablerate US Dollar denominated debt Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of 104 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors Neither do we use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is nonoperating income net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies was 34 billion as of each of May 31 2018 and 2017 and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies was 14 billion as of each of May 31 2018 and 2017 The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31 2018 and 2017 The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities Net gains or losses related to these forward contracts are included in nonoperating income net The effects of

consultants and advisers In fiscal 2011 our stockholders upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors the Board approved the adoption of the Amended and Restated 2000 LongTerm Equity Incentive Plan the 2000 Plan which extended the termination date of the 2000 Plan by 10 years and increased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388313015 shares In fiscal 2014 our

the date of grant PSOs granted to four of our executive officers in fiscal 2018 consist of seven numerically equivalent vesting tranches that potentially may vest One tranche vests solely on attainment of a marketbased metric The remaining six tranches require the attainment of both a performance metric and a market capitalization metric In each case the marketbased metric performance metrics and market capitalization metrics may be achieved at any time during a five year performance period assuming continued employment and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors certifies that performance has been achieved The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years in comparison to the typical ten year contractual lives for SOs For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense is to be recognized once each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service We have preliminarily estimated service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement to be approximately three to five years Stockbased compensation for the marketbased tranche will be recognized using the derived service period for the marketbased metric achievement which we have initially estimated to be approximately three years 109 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 In fiscal 1993 the Board adopted the 1993 Directors

longer subject to audit for those periods Our US state income tax returns with some exceptions have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2004 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods Internationally tax authorities for numerous nonUS jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits We believe that it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2018 the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both by as much as 162 million 68 million net of offsetting tax benefits in the next 12 months related primarily to transfer pricing With some exceptions we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in nonUS jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997 We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits However there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof On July 27 2015 in Altera Corp v Commissioner the US Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement At this time the US Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stockbased compensation from its regulations We have reviewed this case and its impact on Oracle and concluded that no adjustment to the consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries including in particular Australia Brazil Canada India Indonesia Korea Mexico Spain and the United Kingdom where the amounts under controversy are significant In some although not all cases we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary If our estimates of the federal state and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment it could result in a further charge to expense 15 SEGMENT

the chief operating decision maker or decisionmaking group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance Our chief operating decision makers CODMs are our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer We are organized by line of business and geographically While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed The footnote information below presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the companys performance and allocating company resources We have three businessescloud and license hardware and serviceseach of which are comprised of a single operating segment Our cloud and license business engages in the sale marketing and delivery of our applications platform and infrastructure technologies through various deployment models including license support offerings Oracle Cloud Services offerings and cloud license and onpremise license offerings License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and onpremise licenses purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term Our Oracle Cloud Services offerings deliver certain of our applications platform and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloudbased deployment models that we host manage and support and revenues generally are recognized over the subscription period Cloud license and onpremise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses generally on a perpetual basis to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and onpremise IT environments and are generally recognized as revenues when unrestricted access to the license is granted provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage industryspecific hardware operating systems virtualization management

County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing defamation intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HPs Itaniumbased servers it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd the Hurd Settlement Agreement who is our Chief Executive Officer and was both HPs former chief executive officer and chairman of HPs board of directors HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief Oracle answered the complaint and filed a crosscomplaint which was amended on December 2 2011 The amended crosscomplaint alleged claims including violation of the Lanham Act Oracle alleged that HP had secretly agreed to pay Intel to continue to develop and manufacture the Itanium microprocessor and had misrepresented to customers that the Itanium microprocessor had a long roadmap among other claims Oracle sought equitable rescission of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief The court bifurcated the trial and tried HPs causes of action for declaratory relief and promissory estoppel without a jury in June 2012 The court issued a final statement of decision on August 28 2012 finding that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HPs Itaniumbased servers and to port such products at no cost to HP for as long as HP sells those servers the Phase One Ruling A jury trial began on May 23 2016 On June 30 2016 the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and 121 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 against Oracle on its claim for violation of the Lanham Act the Phase Two Jury Verdict The jury awarded HP damages in the amount of 30 billion and HP is entitled to postjudgment interest on this award On August 30 2016 the court denied HPs motion for prejudgment interest Judgment was entered on October 20 2016 Oracle posted certain courtmandated surety bonds with the court in order to proceed with its motion for a new trial and entered into related indemnification agreements with each of the surety bond issuing companies Oracle filed a motion for a new trial on November 14 2016 which was denied Oracle filed its notice of appeal on January 17 2017 specifying that it was appealing the trial courts Phase One Ruling and Phase Two Jury Verdict On February 2 2017 HP filed a notice of appeal of the trial courts denial of prejudgment interest No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations either prior to or subsequent to the Phase One Ruling or Phase Two Jury Verdict We continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HPs claims and we intend to present these defenses to the appellate court Among the arguments we expect to make on appeal are the following the trial court misapplied fundamental principles of contract law and misinterpreted the Hurd Settlement Agreement including by disregarding the context of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and the evidence of the parties mutual intentions that HPs breach of contract claim should fail as a matter of law because HP does not claim and did not prove that Oracle failed to deliver any software under the trial courts interpretation of the contract that awarding HP both damages for breach of the Hurd Settlement Agreement and specific performance of that agreement constitutes an improper double recovery and that the damages award is excessive unsupported by the evidence and contrary to law We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process and the nature of the claims Litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of the appeal process related to this action is uncertain It is possible that the resolution of this action could have a material impact to our future cash flows and results of operations Derivative Litigation On May 3 2017 a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware The derivative suit is brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle purportedly on Oracles behalf against Oracle our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Technology Officer in his capacities as a director officer and an alleged controlling stockholder one of our Chief Executive Officers who is also a director three other directors and Oracle as a nominal defendant Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc NetSuite at an excessive price Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief an order rescinding or reforming the NetSuite transaction unspecified monetary damages including interest attorneys fees and costs and disgorgement of various unspecified profits fees compensation and benefits On July 18 2017 a second stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware brought by another alleged stockholder of Oracle purportedly on Oracles behalf The suit is brought against all current members and one former member of our Board of Directors and Oracle as a nominal defendant Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite at an excessive price Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief unspecified monetary damages including interest and attorneys fees and costs On August 9 2017 the court consolidated the two derivative cases In a September 7 2017 order the court appointed plaintiffs counsel in the second case as lead plaintiffs counsel and designated the July 18 2017 complaint as the operative complaint The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on October 27 2017 and after briefing and argument the court denied this motion on March 19 2018 The parties stipulated that all of the individual defendants except for our Chief Technology Officer and one of our Chief Executive Officers should be dismissed from this case without prejudice and on March 28 2018 the court approved this stipulation On May 4 2018 the remaining defendants answered plaintiffs complaint 122 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued May 31 2018 On May 4 2018 the Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee the SLC to investigate the allegations in this derivative action Three outside directors serve on the SLC While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations Other Litigation We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims either asserted or unasserted which arise in the ordinary course of business including proceedings and
