indirect channels No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 In the United States US our sales and services employees are based in our headquarters and in field offices throughout the country Outside the US our international subsidiaries sell support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales subsidiary Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography specific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings Our international operations subject us to certain risks which are more fully described in Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this Annual Report A summary of our domestic and international revenues and longlived assets is set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report 12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We also market our product offerings worldwide through indirect channels The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network The Oracle Partner Network is a global program that manages our business relations hips with a large broadbased network of companies including independent software and hardware vendors system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon our product offerings By offering our partners access to o ur product offerings educational information technical services marketing and sales support the Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to c ustomers globally The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and valueadded resellers Research and Development We develop the substantial majority of our product offerings internally In addition we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products We have a number of US and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology While we believe that our patents have value no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal businesses Rapid technological advances in hardware and software development evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions offerings and enhancements characterize the markets in which we compete We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current product and service offerings Employees As of May 31 2019 we employed approximately 136000 fulltime employees including approximately 39000 in sales and marketing approximately 18000 in our cloud services and license support operations approximately 4000 in hardware approximately 24000 in services approximately 38000 in research and development and approximately 13000 in general and administrative positions Of these employees approximately 48000 were employed in the US and approximately 88000 were employed internationally None of our employees in the US is represented by a labor union however in certain foreign subsidiaries labor unions or workers councils represent some of our employees Seasonality and Cyclicality Our quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans which are common in the technology industry In each fiscal year our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter The operating margins of our businesses in particular our cloud and license business and hardware business are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues because certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term See Cloud and License Business and Selected Quarterly Financial Data in Item 7 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues expenses and margins Competition We face intense competition in all aspects of our business The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge expand or are acquired as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation sourcing integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software and hardware Our enterprise cloud license and onpremise license and hardware offerings com pete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world including Amazoncom Inc Microsoft Corporation International Business Machines Corporation IBM Intel Corporation Cisco Systems Inc Adobe S ystems Incorporated Alphabet Inc and SAP SE as well as other companies like HewlettPackard Enterprise salesforcecom inc and Workday Inc In addition due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments new technologies and new and gro wing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions or offerings focused on a specific functionality pro duct area or industry In addition as we expand into new market segments we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not pre viously competed Moreover we or our competitors may take certain strategic actionsincluding acquisitions partnerships and joint ventures or repositioning of product lineswhich invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include total cost of ownership performance scalability reliability security functionality efficiency speed to production and quality of technical support Our product and service sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following among other things the adoption of cloudbased IT offerings including SaaS and IaaS offerings ease of deployment use and maintenance of our products and services offerings compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments including our Oracle Cloud environments the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors the broader platform competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the NET programming environment of Microsoft operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems with alternatives including Microsofts Windows Server and other UNIX and Linux operating systems the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers products features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff products features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants systems integrators or other third parties and attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers For more information about the competitive risks we face refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included

driven by factors that we cannot control or predict The following discussion as well as our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 highlights some of these risks The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services Rapid technological advances intense competition changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand customers may not purchase or subscribe to our license hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business In addition we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services including the launch of the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service The Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service offers automation based on machine learning and we have guaranteed among other matters that it will reduce customer downtime to less than 30 minutes a year and that Amazon Data Warehouse customers will see a significant cost reduction if they migrate their workloads to our offering Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly driving innovations in technology but if they fail to operate as anticipated or the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service or our other products do not perform as promised our business and reputation may be harmed In addition our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames infrastructure costs to deliver new or enhanced products and services take longer or result in greater costs than anticipated there is a delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customers to new enhanced or acquired product lines or services there are changes in information technology IT trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts we do not optimize complementary product lines and services in a timely manner or we fail to adequately integrate support or enhance acquired product lines or services Our Oracle Cloud strategy including our Oracle SoftwareasaService SaaS and InfrastructureasaService IaaS offerings may adversely affect our revenues and profitability We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via deployment models that best suit their needs including via our cloudbased SaaS and IaaS offerings As these business models continue to evolve we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and onpremise license and hardware product arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements Customers generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions Consequently any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations This is in contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products We have also acquired a number of cloud computing companies and the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient or scalable as anticipated which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions We might experience significant coding manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud license and hardware offerings Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service our cloud license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding or manufacturing errors that can impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly Errors in our cloud license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function integrate or operate with other cloud license or hardware offerings could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services This includes thirdparty software products or services incorporated into our own If we experience errors or delays in releasing our cloud license or hardware offerings or new versions of these offerings our sales could be affected and revenues could decline In addition we run Oracles business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks Therefore any flaws could affect our and our customers abilities to conduct business operations and to ensure accuracy in financial processes and reporting and may result in unanticipated costs Enterprise customers rely on our cloud license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud license and hardware offerings and related services could expose us to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation which could impact our future sales If our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result our data our customers data or our IT systems are accessed improperly made unavailable or improperly modified our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable our brand and reputation could be damaged the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using our products and services all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions We are in the IT business and our products and services including our Oracle Cloud Services store retrieve manipulate and manage our customers information and data external data as well as our own data We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products services and the internal and external data that we manage At times we encounter attempts by third parties which may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations such as statesponsored organizations nation states and individuals sponsored by them to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities penetrate or bypass our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers partners and suppliers software hardware and cloud offerings networks and systems any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers Computer hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our networks systems products and services exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our networks systems products and services create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service This is also true for thirdparty data products or services incorporated into our own Our products and services including our Oracle Cloud Services may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer partner employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers partners employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data our customers suppliers or partners data or the IT systems of Oracle our customers suppliers or partners 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cybera ttacks targeting IT products and businesses Although this is an industrywide problem that affects software and hardware companies generally it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most prominent IT com panies and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for and marketing efforts associated with having secure products and services These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large am ounts of data including personal information and our customers confidential information and data and host or manage parts of our customers businesses in cloudbased IT environments especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data s uch as health sciences financial services retail hospitality and the government We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies products services and technologies over the years While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage IT systems change frequently grow more complex over time and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent against such techniques Our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adapters of new technologies However our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge In addition we may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach We could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers or suppliers data other external data or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted or if our products or services are reported to have or are perceived as having security vulnerabilities Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services including our cloud offerings and perceive them to not be secure This could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenues and earnings The costs we would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses These types of security incidents could also lead to loss or destruction of information inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data lawsuits indemnity obligations regulatory investigations and financial penalties and claims and increased legal liability including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is a security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims customer dissatisfaction reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position Our business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify In addition US and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations in a manner that could significantly impact our ability as well as the ability of our customers partners and data providers to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide For example certain data transfer mechanisms are currently subject to challenges in European courts which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers to the US or interruption of such transfers In the event any court blocks transfers to or from a particular jurisdiction on the basis that no transfer mechanisms are legally adequate this could give rise to operational interruption in the performance of services for customers and internal processing of employee information regulatory liabilities or reputational harm This impact could also occur in those jurisdictions where privacy laws or regulators take a broader view of how personal information is defined therefore subjecting the handling of such data to heightened restrictions that may be obstructive to our operations and the operations of our customers partners and data providers This impact could be acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized in country as this imposes financial costs on any service provider that is required to store data in jurisdictions not of its choosing and nonstandard operational processes that are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In the wake of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation GDPR the rate of global consideration and adoption of privacy laws has increased giving rise to more global jurisdictions in which regulatory in quiries and audits may be requested of Oracle and if not deemed to be in compliance could result in enf orcement actions andor fines Th is is true in the US where California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA effective in Janua ry 2020 Congress is considering several privacy bills at the federal level and other state legislatures are considering privacy laws Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations The GDPR which became effective in May 2018 provides for monetary penalties of up to 4 of an organizations worldwide revenue One European data protection regulator has fined a major US technology company EUR 50 million for its data handling practices The US Federal Trade Commissio n continues to fine companies on a regular basis for unfair and deceptive data protection practices and these fines may increase in size The CCPA provides for statutory damages on a per violation basis that could be very large in the event of a significa nt data security b reach or other CCPA violation Taken together the changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of data could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to data protection a nd our cost of providing our products and services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate Although we have implemented contracts policies and procedures des igned to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors partners data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts policies and procedures Additionall y public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to provide certain products We make statements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy information provided on our website and press statements Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these public statements or with US federal state or foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations regulating privacy data security or consumer protection public perception standards selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in lost or restricted business proceedings actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation Economic political and market conditions can adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting These include general economic and business conditions overall demand for enterprise cloud license and hardware products and services governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities and general legal regulatory and political developments Macroeconomic developments like the developments associated with the United Kingdoms vote to exit the EU Brexit evolving trade policies between the US and international trade partners or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic political or market conditions could negatively affect our business operating results financial condition and outlook which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Any general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition international regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world potential public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and politica l uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and onpremise license hardware an d related services and to a lesser extent also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our subscriptionbased cloud offerings If we are unable to compete effectively the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed We face intense competition in all aspects of our business The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge expand or are acquired as technology evolves and as delivery models change Many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructure technologies including databases middleware products application development tools business applications collaboration products and business intelligence compute storage and networking products among others which compete with Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings Use of our competitors technologies may influence a customers purchasing decision or create an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize or migrate to Oracle products and services Our competition may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services at a risk profile that we may not generally find acceptable which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products add new functionality acquire competitive products reduce prices better execute on their sales and marketing strategies offer more flexible business practices or form strategic alliances with other companies We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully Any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license hardware and services offerings and we may also incur increased cloud delivery expenses as we expand our cloud operations and update our infrastructure all of which could reduce our revenues andor profitability Our license support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees respectively Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings We introduced Oracle Bring Your Own License BYOL and Universal Credit Pricing to simplify the way customers purchase and consume our cloud services Oracle BYOL enables customers to maintain their existing software licenses for Oracle Infrastructure while expanding their platform technology footprint at a discounted price Oracle Universal Credit Pricing provides a flexible model for customers to access Oracle Infrastructure services on demand via a single contract Any future changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy commit to large customer deployments at prices that are unprofitable or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations These practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the US Our international operations include cloud operations cloud software and hardware development manufacturing assembly sales customer support cons ulting and other services and shared administrative service centers Compliance with international and US laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions These laws and regulations include US laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws foreign currencyrelated regulations anticompetition regulations prohibitions on payments to governmental officials market access tariffs import export and general trade regulations including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business including the loss of trade privileges Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results Compliance with these laws requires a significant amount of management attention and effort which may divert managements attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded Where circumstances warrant we provide information and report our findings to government authorities but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally including those related to general economic conditions in each country or region fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts on customer demand and our operating results difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation of our net assets in particular our cash assets in that countrys currency regulatory changes including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries political unrest terrorism and the potential for other hostilities common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics practices and conduct policies natural disasters the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding wildfires and increased storm sensitivity longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable overlapping tax regimes public health risks social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks particularly in areas in which we have significant operations and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware business and the sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited a publicly traded company in India and Oracle Corporation Japan a publicly traded company in Japan we are faced with several additional risks including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if these entities were whollyowned subsidiaries Any failure to offer highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure offerings We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services Increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results Any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality technical support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors Our revenues particularly certain of our cloud license and onpremise license revenues and hardware revenues can be difficult to forecast As a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate For our Oracle Cloud Services our actual conversion or renewal rates may differ from those used in our forecasts because this business is continuing to evolve and such rates may be unpredictable which could have an adverse effect on our longterm results For our license business we use a pipeline system a common industry practice to forecast sales and trends in that business Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline Our pipeline estimates can be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate A reduction in the conversion rates renewal rates or in the pipeline itself could adversely affect our business or results of operations In particular a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rates and renewal rates in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled The conversion rates can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms which can also impede our ability to negotiate execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner In addition for newly acquired companies we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition Conversion rates and renewal rates postacquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies historical conversion rates Differences in conversion rates and renewal rates can also be affected by changes in business practices that we implement in our newly acquired companies These changes may negatively affect customer behavior A substantial portion of the revenue value of our cloud license and onpremise license and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are larger value orders Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability The number of large license transactions and to a lesser extent hardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may experience foreign currency gains and losses Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability We conduct a significant number of transactions and ho ld cash in currencies other than the US Dollar Changes in the values of major foreign currencies particularly the Euro Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the US Dollar can significantly affect our total assets revenues operating results a nd cash flows which are reported in US Dollars In particular the economic uncertainties relating to Brexit and European sovereign and other debt obligations may cause the value of the British Pound and Euro to fluctuate relative to the US Dollar Fl uctuations in foreign currency rates including the strengthening of the US Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in US Dollars after convertin g our foreign currency results into US Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currencybased enterprises to purchase In addition currency variati ons can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the US Generally our reported revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected wh en the dollar weakens In addition our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits among other assets are held in foreign currencies In addition we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term which are charged against earnings in the period incurred We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures We may suspend the program from time to time As part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses A large portion of our consolidated operations are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts For example we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or costeffective to hedge our foreign currency exposures if our hedging efforts are ineffective or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the US Dollar We could incur future losses in emerging market countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationary Our periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes product changes performance issues change in strategies acquisitions and other internal and external considerations In the past these types of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities In addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these restructurings or may not do so within the expected timeframe These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management including our Chairman of the Board of Directors Chief Technology Officer and founder our Chief Executive Officers other members of our executive team and other key employees In the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and oth er personnel We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel With rare except ions we do not have longterm employment or noncompetition agreements with our employees Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs When we make adjustments to our workforce we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program In addition changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent Our general compensation program includes restricted stock units and performancebased equity which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry If our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stockbased compensation which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel Our sales to government clients expose us to business volatility and risks including government budgeting cycles and appropriations procurement regulations governmental policy shifts early termination of contracts audits investigations sanctions and penalties We derive revenues from contracts with the US government state and local governments and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of those contracts Governmental entities are variously pursuing policies that affect our ability to sell our products and services Changes in government procurement policy priorities technology initiatives andor contract award criteria may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector We are also subject to early termination of our contracts Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time without cause For example the US federal government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts at its convenience or for default based on our performance US federal contracts are subject to the congressional approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts Similarly our contracts with US state and local governments foreign governments and their agencies are generally subject to government funding authorizations Contracts may be terminated based upon a lack of appropriated funds There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending as governments continue to face significant deficit reduction pressures This may adversely impact spending on government programs Government contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations If violations of law are found they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Acquisitions present many risks and we may not achieve the financi al and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction We continue to make strategic acquisitions of c ompanies products services and technologies We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to ma ke acquisitions in the future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy Risks we may face in connection with o ur acquisition program include our ongoing business may be disrupted and our managements attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities we may have difficulties 1 managing an acquired companys technologies or lines of business 2 entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions or 3 retaining key personnel from the acquired companies an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected we may impose our business practices or alter gotomarket strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by 1 claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition including among others claims from government agencies terminated employees current or former customers former stockholders or other third parties 2 preexisting contractual relationships that we assume from an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business 3 unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired companys practices and 4 intellectual property claims or disputes we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology which could result in 1 unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure 2 unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increases in taxes due 3 the loss of anticipated tax benefits or 4 other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition we may not realize any anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons including 1 if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew cloudbased subscription contracts or license support or hardware support contracts 2 if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base 3 if acquired customers do not elect to purchase our technologies due to differing business practices or 4 if contract models utilized by an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies products services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of business and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards architecture controls procedures and policies we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered priced delivered and supported differently which could cause customer confusion and delays we may incur higher than anticipated costs 1 to support develop and deliver acquired products or services 2 for general and administrative functions that support new business models or 3 to comply with regulations applicable to an acquired business that are more complicated than we had anticipated we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from or may otherwise have certain limitations restrictions penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements we may be u nable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis if at all which could among other things 1 delay or prevent us from completing a transaction 2 adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions 3 restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or 4 have other adverse effects on our current business and operations our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash including 1 stock repurchases 2 dividend payments and 3 retirement of outstanding indebtedness among others we may significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease and we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to US generally accepted accounting principles including arrangements that we may assume in an acquisition The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions Our hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline Our hardware business may adversely affect our overall profitability We may not achieve our estimated revenue profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors including our changes in hardware strategies offerings and technologies which could adversely affect demand for our hardware products our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues and thus has been less profitable than our cloud and license business our focus on our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems and the deemphasis of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products could adversely affect our hardware revenues changes in strategies and frequency for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products could adversely affect our hardware revenues a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results such as potential writedowns and impairments of our inventories higher warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and license and services businesses and amortization and potential impairment of intangible assets associated with our hardware business decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives could adversely affect our hardware revenues and we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but 1 operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operating margins than our own 2 have different legacy business practices and gotomarket strategies than our own that we may alter as a part of our integration efforts which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company 3 leverage different platforms or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating or 4 utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquired products within our own manufacturing operations 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our hardware offerings are complex products and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity the results of our hardware business will suffer We depend on suppliers to develop manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the nece ssary technologies and components for our hardware products and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price quality technology availability or other business constraints As a result our supp ly chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages natural disasters political unrest port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience significant shortag es delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies parts or components from a particular vendor If one or more of the risks described above occurs our hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected We are susceptible to thirdparty manufacturing and logistics delays which could result in the loss of sales and customers We outsource the manufacturing assembly delivery and technology or component design of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the US If these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing sources in a timely or costeffective manner if at all Therefore we continue to explore additional thirdparty manufacturing partners to drive supply chain continuity This could cause the loss of sales and existing or potential customers delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses all of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business These challenges and risks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware products and related supply chain operations In some cases we may be dependent at least initially on these acquired companies supply chain operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these challenges and risks Our cloud and license and hardware indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results Our cloud and license and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers system integratorsimplementers consultants education providers internet service providers network integrators and independent software vendors Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud software and hardware marketing and sales efforts Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants products and services were to decrease There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants If we are not successful we may lose sales opportunities customers and revenues We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights We rely on copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights Despite our efforts these protections may be limited Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property Any patents owned by us may be invalidated circumvented or challenged Any of our pending or future patent applications whether or not being currently challenged may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek if at all In addition the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the US If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Third parties have claimed and in the future may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property righ ts andor breach of license agreement provisions We periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property thr ough asserting claims of infringement and misuse We expect to continue to receive such claims as we continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows the use and support of thirdparty code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the industry the volume of issued patents continues to increase and nonpracticing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments Responding to any such claim regardless of its validity could be time consuming costly and result in litigation divert managements time and attention from developing our business require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products require us to release source code to third parties possibly under open source license terms require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers or otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all Developing our various product offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired Accelerated product and service introductions and short life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position However we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all Business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the US We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems and processes could cause delays in completing sales providing services including some of our cloud offerings and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back office processes A major earthquake or fire political social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change such as increased storm severity drought and pandemics that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Adverse litigation results could affect our business We are subject to various legal proceedings Litigation can be lengthy expensive and disruptive to our operations and can divert our managements attention away from running our core business The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business operating results or financial condition Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities As a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the US and various foreign jurisdictions Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the amount of our tax liabilities including those arising from potential changes in laws in the countries in which we do business and the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities and we are regularly under audit by tax authorities which often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns Any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate Increasingly countries around the world are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations In particular the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the Tax Act significantly changed how corporations are taxed in the US which has had and we expect will continue to have a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes Due to the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended May 31 2018 The US Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service IRS and other standardssetting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied that is different from our interpretation The Tax Act requires complex computations not previously required or produced and significant judgments and assumptions in the interpretation of the law were made in producing our provisional estimates We have adjusted the provisional amounts and reflected the adjustments in our financial statements for the year ended May 31 2019 based on the regulatory and other guidance issued to date by the Treasury Department and IRS but also on judgments and assumptions where uncertainty continues to exist Such uncertainty in the application of the Tax Act to our ongoing operations as well as possible adverse future law changes attributable to changes in the US political environment could have an adverse impact on our future tax rate Other countries also continue to consider enacting changes to their tax laws that could adversely affect us by increasing taxes imposed on our foreign subsidiaries including changes in withholding tax regimes and the imposition of taxes targeted at certain technology businesses More fundamentally longstanding international tax principles that determine each countrys right to tax crossborder transactions are being reconsidered creating significant uncertainty as to the future level of corporate income tax on our international operations This reexamination is driven by a perceived need to provide greater taxing rights to market jurisdictions where customers or users are located Various measures are being discussed including adjustments to transfer pricing rules limitations on deductions and imposition of additional withholding taxes As a part of our income tax structure there are many intercompany transactions and calculations made in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future Although we have negotiated a number of agreements with certain taxing jurisdictions these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing In recent periods transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become increasingly contentious Similarly certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters under current law In addition our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by shifts of earnings from jurisdictions or regimes that have relatively lower statutory tax rates to those in which the rates are relatively higher 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We are also subject to nonincome b ased taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the US and various foreign jurisdictions that have uncertain applicability to the businesses in which we are engaged Although we believe that our income and nonincome based tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805 Business Combinations we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and in each case separately from goodwill Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred which is also generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain After we complete an acquisition the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention redeployment or relocation expenses impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets acquired a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities both income tax and nonincome tax related after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period generally up to one year from the acquisition date whichever comes first charges to our operating results to maintain certain duplicative premerger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities for a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated charges to eliminate certain duplicative premerger activities and charges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition and charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will adversely impact our operating results for the periods in which those costs are incurred Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods based on the timing and size of our future acquisitions and the extent of integration activities A more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combinations and other items is presented in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 included elsewhere in this Annual Report There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness As of May 31 2019 we had an aggregate of 563 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2019 and calendar year 2055 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or t hat the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt Furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense re lating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase Should we incur future increases in interest expense our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our US federal income tax could be limited which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate In addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs Some of our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state federal and international laws governing protection of the environment proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products human health and safety the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers as well as local testing and labelling requirements Compliance with these everchanging environmental and other laws in a timely manner could increase our product design development procurement manufacturing delivery cloud operations and administration costs limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete noncompliant inventory change our sales activities or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability including fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses Regulatory market and competitive pressures regarding the energy intensity and energy mix for our data center operations may also grow The SEC has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain conflict minerals tantalum tin tungsten and gold in their products Our supply chain is multitiered global and highly complex As a provider of hardware endproducts we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain Accordingly our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited Our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales Environmental legislation such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances RoHS the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive WEEE Directive and Chinas regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements The cumulative impact of international environmental legislation could be significant Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price The timing of announcements in the public market by us or by our competitors regarding new products product enhancements technological advances acquisitions or major transactions could also affect our stock price Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price Our stock price could also be affected by factors some of which are beyond our control including among others speculation in the press and the analyst community changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors expectations our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources which could adversely affect our business 31 Table of Contents

Jobs Act of 2017 the Tax Act The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described below under Impacts of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 2 Working capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to 361 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2019 net income Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all of the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuances of longterm senior notes of 100 billion in fiscal 2018 and 140 billion in fiscal 2017 These working capital and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in the fiscal 2015 to 2018 periods presented In addition our total assets were also affected in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussed further below 3 Our notes payable and other borrowings which represented the summation of our notes payable and other borrowings current and notes payable and other borrowings noncurrent as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above decreased during fiscal 2019 primarily due to repayments of certain shortterm borrowings and senior notes Notes payable and other borrowings increased between fiscal 2015 and 2018 primarily due to the fiscal 2018 issuance of longterm senior notes of 100 billion and shortterm borrowings of 25 billion the fiscal 2017 issuance of longterm senior notes of 140 billion and shortterm borrowings of 38 billion and the fiscal 2016 shortterm borrowings of 38 billion See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition Business Overview Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology IT environments Our products and services include applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models These models include onpremise deployments cloudbased deployments and hybrid deployments an approach that combines both onpremise and cloudbased deployment such as our Oracle Cloud at Customer offering an instance of Oracle Cloud in a customers own data center Accordingly we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers needs Our customers include businesses of many sizes government agencies educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network We have three businesses cloud and license hardware and services each of which comprises a single operating segment The descriptions set forth below as a part of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align as to how our chief operating decision makers CODMs which include our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer view our operating results and allocate resources Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license line of business which represented 83 81 and 80 of our total revenues in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively markets sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings Cloud services and license support revenues include license support revenues which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud onpremise and other IT environments Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements which current license support customers are entitled to receive License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license andor onpremise license are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed are generally renewed at the customers option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided which is generally one year and cloud services revenues which provide customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloudbased deployment models that Oracle develops provides unspecified updates and enhancements for hosts manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period The majority of our Oracle Cloud Services arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed have durations of one to three years are generally renewed at the customers option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or in the case of usage model contracts as the cloud services are consumed over time 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Cloud license and onpremise license revenues include revenu es from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications Oracle Database Oracle Middleware and Java among others which our customers deploy within cloudbased onpremise and other IT environments Our cloud license and onpremise l icense transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use Revenues from usagebased royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licen ses and onpremise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point in time for revenue recognition of license transactions which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms Cloud license and onpremise licens e customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts as described above Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy In recent periods customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased To address customer demand and enable customer choice we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads We expect these trends to continue Our cloud and license business revenue growth is affected by many factors including the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings our acquisitions the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses the pricing amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold and foreign currency rate fluctuations On a constant currency basis we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings continued demand for our cloud license and onpremise license offerings and contributions from our acquisitions We believe all of these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license revenues which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services Our cloud and license business margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably the renewal of existing customers cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues ratably and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and onpremise license revenues which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery over those four quarterly periods Hardware Business Our hardware business which represented 9 10 and 11 of our total revenues in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively provides a broad selection of hardware products and hardwarerelated software products including Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage industryspecific hardware operating systems virtualization 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements management and other hardware related software and related hardware support Each hardware product and its related software such as an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation The revenues for this combined perfor mance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer We expect to make investments in research and development to impro ve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and valueadded resellers Our hardware support offer ings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris Our hardware support offerings can also include produ ct repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as r evenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services including direct materials and labor costs Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict Our hardware revenues cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by among others our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings customer demand for competing offerings including IaaS the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products which have a finite life and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available certain of our acquisitions and foreign currency rate fluctuations Services Business Our services business which represented 8 of our total revenues in fiscal 2019 and 9 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2018 and 2017 helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies extensive experience broad sets of intellectual property and best practices Our services offerings include consulting services advanced customer support services and education services Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses Our services revenues are impacted by among others our strategy for and the competitive position of our services customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the associated services for these offerings certain of our acquisitions general economic conditions governmental budgetary constraints personnel reductions in our customers IT departments and tighter controls over customer discretionary spending Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy In recent years we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies products services and technologies including NetSuite in fiscal 2017 We expect to continue to acquire companies products services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements securities We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition wit h regard to earnings operating margin cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB ASC and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes a description of our significant accounting policies GAAP as set forth within the ASC requires us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions as we apply our significant accounting policies The accounting policies that reflect estimates judgments and assumptions that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and for which we include additional discussion below are Revenue Recognition Business Combinations Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments Accounting for Income Taxes and Legal and Other Contingencies Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors Revenue Recognition The most critical judgments required in applying Topic 606 and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price SSP for each performance obligation Many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency Therefore multiple products and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes We allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP the determination of SSP is discussed below for each performance obligation within each contract We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is delivered We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and onpremise licenses we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition changes in demand for our products and services and economic factors among others Our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and onpremise license purchase License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts that is the selling price is highly variable and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence As a result the SSP for a cloud license and an onpremise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and onpremise license revenues Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations in accounting for our acquisitions ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets or to an acquisition of a business A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets contractual obligations assumed preacquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration where applicable Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results For a given acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a nonincome tax related preacquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements J udgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business and other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerat ions macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions These estimates and assumptions include among others revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist In such situations we are required to evaluate whether the net book values of our finite lived intangible assets are recoverable We determine whether finite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and include among others forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts Accounting for Income Taxes Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision In the ordinary course of a global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located We consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known which can materially impact our effective tax rate The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we account for these uncertain tax issues 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements pursuant to ASC 740 Income Taxes which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litiga tion processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit judicial rulings and refinement of estimates or realization of ea rnings or deductions that differ from our estimates To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determina tion is made Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable Because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made As additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Results of Operations Impacts of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding prior year periods and of our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31 2019 relative to May 31 2018 was impacted by the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the Tax Act which was effective for us in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 Information regarding our adoption and the impacts of the Tax Act are included in Notes 1 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Impacts of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was impacted by our recent acquisitions In our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 we may qualitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services revenues for the oneyear period subsequent to the acquisition date to certain of our businesses revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations When material we may also provide quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services Expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations andor were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We caution readers that while pre and postacquisition comparisons as well as any quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends any acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons any qualitative and quantitative disclosures cannot specifically address or quantify the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies including our sales force integration efforts We believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated the relative mix of products and services sold would have been different and the amounts shown as cloud services and license support deferred revenues in our Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges presented below are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewals to the extent customers do not renew Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information In our fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 results of operations discussion below we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues total consolidated expenses and total consolidated operating margin all of which are presented on a GAAP basis We also present a GAAPbased discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statement of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses In addition we discuss below the fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 results of each our three businessescloud and license hardware and serviceswhich are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280 Segment Reporting The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each business in the discussion below Consistent with our internal management reporting processes the below operating segment presentation includes revenues adjustments related to cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements Refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for additional discussion of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total

development expenses general and administrative expenses stockbased compensation expenses amortization of intangible assets certain other expense allocations acquisition related and other expenses restructuring expenses interest expense nonoperating income net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items andor it is impractical to do so Refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before provision of income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is presented below and the results for both fiscal 2019 and 2018 have been accounted for and presented to reflect our adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 201707 neither of which materially impacted our financial condition or results of operations for fiscal 2019 or 2018 A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended May 31 2018 filed with the SEC on June 22 2018 which is available free of charge on the SECs website at wwwsecgov and our Investor Relations website at wwworaclecominvestor Our consolidated 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements financial statements for the fiscal years ended and as of May 31 2018 and 2017 included elsewhere in this Annual Report have been retrospectively restated to reflect the adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 201707 The adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 2 01707 did not have a material impact on the comparability of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 relative to fiscal 2017 as presented in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended May 31 2018 Additio nal information regarding our adoption of Topic 606 and ASU 201707 is included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses revenues and expenses As a result each businesses revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the US Dollar against major international currencies In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure To present this information current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US Dollars are converted into US Dollars at constant exchange rates ie the rates in effect on May 31 2018 which was the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods For example if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 10 million Euros from products sold on May 31 2019 and 2018 our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of 111 million in fiscal 2019 using 111 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period and 116 million in fiscal 2018 using 116 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period The constant currency presentation however would translate the fiscal 2019 results using the fiscal 2018 exchange rate and indicate in this example no change in revenues during the period In each of the tables below we present the percent change based on actual unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements

fiscal 2018 due to growth in our cloud and license revenues partially offset by decreases in our hardware revenues and services revenues The constant currency increase in our cloud and license revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud deployment models and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud and license support contracts to continue to gain access to our latest technology and support services and was also attributable to growth in our cloud license and onpremise license revenues The constant currency decreases in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 were due to a reduction in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloudbased infrastructure technologies which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts The constant currency decrease in our services revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 was attributable to declines in our consulting and education services revenues In constant currency the Americas EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 40 33 and 27 respectively to the growth in our fiscal 2019 total revenues Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher expenses related to our cloud and license business which resulted primarily from increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and license business revenues This constant currency expense increase was partially offset by certain expense decreases in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 primarily lower expenses related to our hardware business and lower restructuring expenses In constant currency our total operating margin increased during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in revenues and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues remained flat 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future You should review the introduction under Impacts of Acquisitions above for a discussion of the inherent limitations in comparing pre and postacquisition information Our operating results reported pursuant

tax reform 8 389 6870 2054 9330 1 In connection with our acquisitions we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed Due to our application of business combination accounting rules we did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities upon delivery of the contractual obligations To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us we expect to recognize revenues for the full contracts values over the respective contracts renewal periods 2 Certain acquired companies capitalized sales commissions associated with subscription agreements and amortized these amounts over the related contractual terms Business combination accounting rules generally require us to eliminate these acquired capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date and our postcombination GAAP sales and marketing expenses generally do not reflect the amortization of these acquired deferred sales commissions balances This adjustment is intended to include and thus reflect the full amount of amortization related to such balances as though the acquired companies operated independently in the periods presented 3 Represents the amortization of intangible assets substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions As of May 31 2019 estimated future amortization related to intangible assets was as follows in millions

our income before provision for income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stockbased compensation amortization of intangible assets restructuring and certain other acquisition related items after excluding the effects of income tax reform see footnote 8 below and for fiscal 2019 after excluding a tax benefit arising from the increase of a deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure resulted in an effective tax rate of 185 and 208 in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively instead of 97 and 711 respectively which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations 8 The income tax reform adjustments presented in the table above were due to the enactment of the Tax Act refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report which was effective for us in fiscal 2018 and also due to subsequent income tax expense adjustments made pursuant to SAB 118 during fiscal 2019 Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license business engages in the sale marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through various deployment models including Oracle Cloud Services offerings cloud license and onpremise license offerings and license support offerings Oracle Cloud Services deliver certain of our applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloudbased deployment models that we develop provide unspecified updates and enhancements for host manage upgrade and support Our cloud services revenues are generally recognized over the contractual term which is generally one to three years or in the case of usage model contracts as the cloud services are consumed Cloud license and onpremise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses generally on a perpetual basis to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and onpremise IT environments and are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and onpremise licenses purchased and renewed by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term which is generally one year We continue to place significant emphasis both domestically and internationally on direct sales through our own sales force We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses and sales and marketing expenses These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings and marketing program costs 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Year Ended May 31 Percent

Business Our hardware business revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems server storage and industryspecific hardware products Each hardware product and its related software such as an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased and renewed by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term which is generally one year The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and valueadded resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by thirdparty manufacturers warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete the cost of materials used to repair customer products the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide

during fiscal 2018 and lower interest income in fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower average cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances during fiscal 2019 Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates In fiscal 2018 the Tax Act was signed into law The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described above under Impacts of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the US federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods Future effective income tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations by adverse rulings in tax related litigation or by shortfalls in stockbased compensation realized by employees

were recorded in fiscal 2018 To a lesser extent provision for income taxes also decreased in fiscal 2019 due to the net favorable impacts of our final accounting for the Tax Act in fiscal 2019 the net favorable impacts of the Tax Act on our tax profile during fiscal 2019 the favorable impact of a tax benefit arising from an increase in a deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure in fiscal 2019 and lower income before provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019 These decreases to our provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 were partially offset both by lower excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation expense in fiscal 2019 and by less favorable changes in net unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements with tax

equivalents and marketable securities 37827 44 67261 Working capital The decrease in working capital as of May 31 2019 in comparison to May 31 2018 was primarily due to 361 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock the reclassification of 45 billion of longterm senior notes as a current liability and cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders during fiscal 2019 These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the favorable effects to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2019 and to a lesser extent proceeds from stock option exercises Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods the amounts and timing of which are variable Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks Tier1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less Marketable securities consist of Tier1 commercial paper debt securities corporate debt securities and certain other securities The decrease in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31 2019 in comparison to May 31 2018 was primarily due to 361 billion used for repurchases of our common stock the repayment of 45 billion of borrowings payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures These cash 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements outflows were partially offset by certain fiscal 2019 cash inflows pri marily cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises during fiscal 2019 The amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the cash cash

consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report As the US Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2019 the

terms which are generally one year in length Over the course of a fiscal year we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses cloud services hardware offerings and services Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products taxes interest payments and leased facilities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to certain unfavorable cash changes in working capital balances primarily unfavorable changes associated with income taxes including the first installment payment made pursuant to the transition tax provisions of the Tax Act during fiscal 2019 see additional discussion of future installment payments pursuant to the Tax Acts transition tax under Contractual Obligations below Cash flows from investing activities The changes in cash flows from investing activities

intangible assets to support our growth Net cash provided by investing activities was 266 billion during fiscal 2019 compared to 56 billion of net cash used for investing during fiscal 2018 The increase in net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in sales and maturities of and a decrease in purchases of marketable securities and other investments Cash flows from financing activities The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments as well as stock repurchases dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2019 increased compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased stock repurchases as we used 361 billion of cash to repurchase common stock during fiscal 2019 compared to 113 billion during fiscal 2018 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Free cash

senior notes and other borrowings outstanding as of May 31 2019 after considering certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBORbased index Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements based upon the interest rates applicable as of May 31 2019 and are subject to change in future periods interest payments on our floatingrate senior notes that are based upon the interest rates applicable to the senior notes as of May 31 2019 and are subject to change in future periods certain

manufacture subassemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon leadtimes andor commercially standard leadtimes for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way As of May 31 2019 we had 76 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits including related interest and penalties recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled We cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2020 We are involved in claims and legal proceedings All 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty o f claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which are out of our control Notes 14 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this An nual Report includes additional information regarding these contingencies We believe that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements In addition we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities OffBalance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably

compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders We recognize that restricted stockbased awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stockbased awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages Consistent with these dual goals our cumulative potential dilution since June 1 2016 has been a weightedaverage annualized rate of 17 per year The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stockbased awards or stock options granted and assumed net of restricted stockbased awards and 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company divided by the weightedaverage outstanding shares during the calculation period This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stockbased awards vest and stock options ar e exercised Of the outstanding stock options at May 31 2019 which generally have a tenyear exercise period approximately 23 have exercise prices higher than the market price of our common stock on such date In recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stockbased compensation program However we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions to pay dividends to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes As of May 31 2019 the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restric ted stockbased awards and unexercised stock options regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date was 96 During fiscal 2019 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organizationwide stockbased award grants to selected employees all stockbased award grants to senior officers and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62500 or greater The annual organizationwide stockbased award grants to selected employees are generally approved by the Compensation Committee during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report Each member of a separate executive officer committee referred to as the Plan Committee was allocated a fiscal 2019 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee Restricted stockbased award and stock option

financial statements if any see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk Cash Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 378 billion and 673 billion as of May 31 2019 and 2018 respectively Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investmentgrade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investmentgrade ratings criteria which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks In addition as of May 31 2019 substantially all of our marketable securities were high quality with approximately 33 having maturity dates within one year and 67 having maturity dates within one to four years a description of our marketable securities held is included in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and Liquidity and Capital Resources above We held a mix of both fixed and floatingrate debt securities Fixed rate securities may have their market values adversely impacted as interest rates increase while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall Due in part to these factors our future investment income may vary due to changes in interest rates or we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary The fair values of our fixedrate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of each of May 31 2019 and 2018 we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by 128 million and 308 million respectively We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities For fiscal 2019 and 2018 total interest income was 11 billion and 12 billion respectively with our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 208 and 173 respectively on a worldwide basis Interest Expense Risk Interest Expense Risk Interest Rate Swap Agreements and CrossCurrency Interest Rate Swap Agreements Our total borrowings were 563 billion as of May 31 2019 consisting of 554 billion of fixedrate borrowings 750 million of floatingrate borrowings FloatingRate Notes and 113 million of other borrowings As of May 31 2019 we held certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our 20 billion of 225 fixedrate senior notes due October 2019 October 2019 Notes and our 15 billion of 280 fixedrate senior notes due July 2021 July 2021 Notes so that the fixedrate interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR We have also entered into crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our 750 million of 3125 fixedrate senior notes due July 2025 Notes July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixedrate Euro denominated debt including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to variablerate US Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the October 2019 Notes July 2021 Notes and July 2025 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to including the notional amounts and maturity dates We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes We are accounting for these swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 The fair values of our outstanding fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31 2019 and 2018 were a 17 million net loss and a 26 million net loss respectively We estimate that the changes in the fair values of these swap agreements during fiscal 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to an increase in forward interest rate prices If LIBORbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31 2019 and 2018 the change would have decreased the collective fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by 90 million and 315 million respectively 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements By issuing the FloatingRate Notes and by entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates As of May 31 2019 and 2018 if LIBORbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points the change would have increased our interest expense a nnually by approximately 52 million and 86 million respectively as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and floatingrate borrowings Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations Given the short duration of the forward contracts amounts recorded generally are not significant The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is nonoperating income net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 38 billion and 34 billion as of May 31 2019 and 2018 respectively and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 33 billion and 14 billion as of May 31 2019 and 2018 respectively The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31 2019 and 2018 Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in nonoperating income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were 111 million 74 million and 152 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future the amounts and timing of which are unknown Foreign Currency Translation RiskImpact on Cash Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into US Dollars In particular the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report As the US Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2019 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in US Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31 2019 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate from May 31 2018 As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in US Dollars was a decrease of 158 million for fiscal 2019 an increase of 57 million for fiscal 2018 and a decrease of 86 million in fiscal 2017 If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the US Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10 as of May 31 2019 and May 31 2018 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in US Dollars would have decreased by approximately 434 million and 555 million respectively assuming constant foreign currency cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The response to this item is submitted as a separate section of this Annual Report See Part IV Item 15 Item 9 Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None Item 9A Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10K we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a15e and 15d15e Based on our managements evaluation with the participation of our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report our Principal Executive Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31 2019 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a15f and 15d15f Under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2019 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commissions 2013 framework Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP Based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31 2019 We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 201 9 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of Exchange Act Rules 13a15 or 15d15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting We implemented internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of the new accounting standard related to revenue recognition on our financial statements to facilitate its adoption on June 1 2018 There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new standard Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management including our Principal Executive Officers one of whom is our Principal Financial Officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level However our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud A control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met Further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake Additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate Because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected Item 9B Other Information None 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements PART III Item 10 Directors Executive

internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate s Ernst Young LLP San Jose California June 21 2019 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS As of May 31 2019 and

of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977 Basis of Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracles stockholders for all periods presented The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have been included as a component of nonoperating income net in our consolidated statements of operations Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated Certain other prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues operating income or net income In fiscal 2019 we adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates Accounting Standards Update ASU 201409 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance ASU 201514 ASU 201608 ASU 201610 ASU 201612 ASU 201620 ASU 201710 ASU 201713 and ASU 201714 collectively Topic 606 utilizing the full retrospective method of transition whereby the results and related disclosures for the comparative fiscal 2018 and 2017 periods presented in this Form 10K were recast to be presented as if Topic 606 had been in effect during fiscal 2018 and 2017 Retrospective adjustments applicable prior to June 1 2016 were recorded as a cumulativeeffect adjustment that resulted in a 43 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCL and an 820 million increase in retained earnings Refer to the Revenue Recognition and Deferred Sales Commissions sections below for accounting policy updates upon our adoption of Topic 606 ASU 201712 Derivatives and Hedging Topic 815 Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2019 requires us to account for ASU 201 712 as of the date of adoption with any retrospective adjustments applicable to prior periods included as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to AOCL and retained earnings The adoption of ASU 201712 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financia l statements as of the adoption date or f or any of the periods presented As a result of the adoption of ASU 201712 we have elected to modify certain of our hedge documentation to exclude the fair value of certain components of the related hedging instru

Periodic Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costs ASU 201707 which provides guidance on the capitalization presentation and disclosure of net benefit costs related to postretirement benefit plans We adopted ASU 201707 on a full retrospective basis which resulted in the retrospective reclassification of 54 million and 42 million respectively of nonservice net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively from line items within operating expenses into nonoperating income net ASU 201616 Income Taxes Topic 740 IntraEntity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory ASU 201616 which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs We adopted ASU 201616 effective June 1 2018 on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulativeeffect adjustment that resulted in a 110 million decrease in prepaid assets with the corresponding offset to retained earnings The impacts of

Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 The comparability of our operating results in fiscal 2019 compared to the corresponding prior year periods and of our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31 2019 relative to May 31 2018 was impacted by the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the Tax Act which was effective for us in our third quarter of fiscal 2018 The Tax Act reduced the US federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 created a quasiterritorial tax system that generally allows companies to repatriate certain foreign source earnings without incurring additional US income tax for such earnings generated after December 31 2017 generally required companies to pay a onetime transition tax pursuant to a payment schedule that settles the tax over multiple future years on certain foreign subsidiary earnings generated prior to December 31 2017 that in substantial part were previously tax deferred created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings limited deductibility of certain future compensation arrangements to certain highly compensated employees and provided tax incentives for the exportation of US products to foreign jurisdictions and for the purchase of qualifying capital equipment among other provisions As a result we recorded a provisional charge to income tax expense of 69 billion in fiscal 2018 which pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118 SAB 118 included a 78 billion provisional charge related to the onetime transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings and a provisional 911 million of income tax benefit related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities During fiscal 2019 we completed our analysis of the impacts of the Tax Act and recorded an income tax benefit of 529 million in accordance with SAB 118 related to adjustments to our estimates of the onetime transition tax on certain foreign subsidiary earnings and an income tax expense of 140 million in accordance with SAB 118 related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2019 To t he extent that there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include cloud and license revenues which include the sale of cloud services and license support and cloud licenses and onpremise licenses which typically represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and onpremise IT environments hardware revenues which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems servers and storage products and industryspecific hardware and hardware support revenues and services revenues which are earned from providing cloud license and hardwarerelated services including consulting advanced customer support and education services License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and onpremise licenses purchased by our customers at their option License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and onpremise license fees Substantially all of our customers elect to renew their license support contracts annually Cloud services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud SoftwareasaService and InfrastructureasaService SaaS and IaaS respectively and collectively Oracle Cloud Services offerings which deliver applications and infrastructure technologies respectively via cloudbased deployment models that we develop functionality for provide unspecified updates and enhancements for host manage upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management maintenance and security services for customer cloudbased onpremise or other IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term Cloud license and onpremise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database middleware application and industryspecific software products which our customers use for cloudbased onpremise and other IT environments The vast majority of our cloud license and onpremise license arrangements include license support contracts which are entered into at the customers option Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems computer servers storage and industryspecific hardware Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees Our services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to among others deploy architect integrate upgrade and secure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies Our advanced customer support services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2019 arrangements to customers buying other products and services We offer these advanced customer support services to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of Oracle products and services Education services include instruct orled mediabased and internetbased training in the use of our cloud software and hardware products Topic 606 is a single standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of our cloud license hardware and services arrangements and generally requires revenues to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services provided to our customers reflecting the amount of consideration we expect to receive for those goods or services Pursuant to Topic 606 revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps identification of the contract or contracts with a customer identification of the performance obligations in the contract determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognition of revenues when or as the contractual performance obligations are satisfied The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers We record an unbilled receivable which is included within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets when revenues are recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary Invoices for cloud license and onpremise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance Cloud SaaS and IaaS contracts are generally invoiced annually quarterly or monthly in advance Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our financing division The transaction price for a contract that is financed through our financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of nonoperating income net within our consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed Our revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant Our arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services Revenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the services are delivered beginning on the date our service is made available to our customers We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period Revenues from cloud services provided on a consumption basis such as metered services are generally recognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer Revenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support Oracles primary performance obligations with respect to license support contracts and hardware support contracts are to provide customers with technical support as needed and unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period if and when they are available Oracle is obligated to make the license and hardware support services available continuously throughout the contract 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2019 period Therefore r evenues for license support contracts and hardware support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods that the support services ar e provided Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and OnPremise License Revenues from distinct cloud license and onpremise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use Revenues from usagebased royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and onpremise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs For usagebased royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer Revenue Recognition for Hardware Products The hardware product and related software such as an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer Revenue Recognition for Services Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed Revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion Revenues for consumptionbased services are generally recognized as the services are performed Allocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency therefore our products and services are generally not combined We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price SSP for each performance obligation within each contract We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and onpremise licenses we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change Our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and onpremise license purchase License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts that is the selling price is highly variable and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence As a result the SSP for a cloud license and an onpremise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and onpremise license revenues 77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION

revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31 2019 and 2018 The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31 2019 that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31 2018 was approximately 83 billion Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31 2019 2018 and 2017 Remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized and include deferred revenues invoices that have been issued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors In each fiscal year the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time As of May 31 2019 our remaining performance obligations were 362 billion approximately 62 of which we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter Refer to Note 15 for our discussion of revenues disaggregation Sales of Financing Receivables We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products hardware products and services offerings through separate longterm payment contracts We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a nonrecourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables During fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 18 billion 17 billion and 16 billion respectively of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 in accounting for our acquisitions ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets or to an acquisition of a business A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations and are accounted for separately from the business combination A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2019 operations in the period in which the liability is incurred When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring ac tivities assumptions are applied regarding estimated sublease payments to be received which can differ from actual results This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may affect our results of operations and financial position in the peri od the revision is made For a given acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a nonincome tax related preacquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Marketable and NonMarketable Securities In accordance with ASC 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities and based on our intentions regarding these instruments we classify substantially all of our marketable debt securities as availableforsale Marketable debt securities classified as availableforsale are reported at fair value with all unrealized gains losses reflected net of tax in stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets and as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income If we determine that an investment has an other than temporary decline in fair value we recognize the investment loss in nonoperating income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required Substantially all of our marketable debt investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations Investments in equity securities other than equity method investments are recorded at fair value if fair value is readily determinable We hold investments in certain nonmarketable equity securities with no readily determinable fair values in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence Upon adoption of ASU 201601 effective June 1 2018 we have elected to measure these equity securities at cost less any impairment adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer Prior to our adoption of ASU 201601 these equity securities were recorded at cost less any impairment Our nonmarketable equity securities are included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are subject to periodic impairment reviews 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2019 Fair Values of Financial Instruments We apply the provisions of ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4 Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices For those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends We writeoff a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and trade receivables Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investmentgrade securities Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty creditrelated losses in these contracts is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of these contracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2019 2018 or 2017 We outsource the manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the US Further we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of thirdparty manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these thirdparty manufacturers build our hardware products Any inability of these thirdparty manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons generally six to nine months Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware expenses In addition we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete At the point of loss recognition a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled 320 million and 398 million at May 31 2019 and 2018

consolidated balance sheets and totaled 776 million and 802 million at May 31 2019 and 2018 respectively Deferred Sales Commissions We defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud license support and hardware support contract Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over a period of benefit that we estimate to be four to five years We determine the period of benefit by taking into consideration the historical and expected durations of our customer contracts the expected useful lives of our technologies and other factors Sales commissions for renewal contracts relating to our cloudbased arrangements are generally deferred and then amortized on a straightline basis over the related contractual renewal period which is generally one to three years Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations Property Plant and Equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value net of accumulated depreciation Depreciation is computed using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives of the assets which range from one to 40 years Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms as appropriate Property plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2019 2018 or 2017 Goodwill Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives which generally range from one to 10 years Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable When goodwill is assessed for impairment we have the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment optional assessment prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test Should the optional assessment be used for any given fiscal year qualitative factors to consider for a reporting unit include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerations macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit If we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed Otherwise no further testing is required For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis the discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis future economic and market conditions and market comparables of peer companies among others If as per the quantitative test the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit impairment is recognized for the difference

unit Our most recent goodwill impairment analysis was performed on March 1 2019 and did not result in a goodwill impairment charge W e did not recognize impairment charge s in fiscal 2018 or 2017 Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value If the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2019 2018 or 2017 At least annually we assess the useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets and may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a shorter amortization period is more reflective of the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows Derivative Financial Instruments During fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 we used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks see Note 10 below for additional information We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of each reporting date ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met ie the instruments are accounted for as hedges The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding earnings offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge each reporting period we record the change in fair value of the derivative to AOCL in our consolidated balance sheets and the change is reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure Descriptions of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination are provided under Business Combinations above For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated Note 17 below provides additional information regarding certain of our legal contingencies Shipping and Handling Costs Our shipping and handling costs for hardware products sales are included in hardware expenses for all periods presented Foreign Currency We transact business in various foreign currencies In general the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local countrys currency Consequently revenues and expenses of operations outside the US are translated into US Dollars using weightedaverage exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the US are translated into US Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet dates The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders equity as a component of AOCL in the accompanying 82 Table of Contents Index to Financial

Compensation Stock Compensation which requires that sharebased payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values We account for forfeitures of stockbased awards as they occur For our servicebased stock awards we recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the service period of the award which is generally four years For our PSUs and PSOs we recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the longer of the derived explicit or implicit service period which is the period of time expected for the performance condition to be satisfied During our interim and annual reporting periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods may cause the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of shares that are expected to vest are reflected in the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU or PSO tranche on a cumulative catch up basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered Changes in estimates of the implicit service periods are recognized prospectively We record deferred tax assets for stockbased compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized in each reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stockbased awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stockbased award vests or a stock option is exercised

record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized A twostep approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated

accordance with ASC 820 ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value An assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities or Level 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are

ratably over the contractual periods Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed Deferred cloud license and onpremise license revenues typically resulted from customer payments that related to undelivered products and services or specified enhancements In connection with our acquisitions we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support performance obligations assumed from our acquired companies We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost buildup approach The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud services and license support deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the postcombination periods 10 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges Interest Rate Swap Agreements and CrossCurrency Interest Rate Swap Agreements In May 2018 we entered into certain crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixedrate Euro denominated 2025 Notes including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to variablerate US Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR In July 2014 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our October 2019 Notes and our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2025 Notes October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to including the notional amounts and maturity dates We have designated the aforementioned swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 The changes in fair values of these swap agreements are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other currentnoncurrent assets or other currentnoncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets The amount of net gain loss attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable current or notes payable noncurrent As a result of our adoption of ASU 201712 we have elected to exclude the portion of the 95 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE

interest settlements for the swap agreements for the July 20 25 Notes October 2019 Notes and July 2021 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities Cash Flow Hedges CrossCurrency Swap Agreements In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes we entered into certain crosscurrency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixedrate Eurodenominated January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to fixedrate US Dollardenominated debt The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in US Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at 16 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 353 We have designated these crosscurrency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815 The critical terms of the crosscurrency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments being hedged and the crosscurrency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes We used the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of our crosscurrency swap agreements The fair values of these crosscurrency swap agreements are recognized as other noncurrent assets or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets We reflect the gains or losses on the effective portion of these crosscurrency swap agreements in AOCL in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of AOCL into nonoperating income net in the same period that the carrying values of the Eurodenominated January 2021 Notes are remeasured and the interest expense is recognized The cash flows related to the crosscurrency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is nonoperating income net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses

stock that may be issued by 388313015 shares In fiscal 2014 our stockholders upon the recommendation of the Board approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 305000000 shares Under the terms of the 2000 Plan longterm full value awards are granted in the form of restricted stock units RSUs and performancebased restricted stock awards PSUs For each share granted as a full value award under the 2000 Plan an equivalent of 25 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant In fiscal 2018 our stockholders upon the recommendation of the Board approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 330000000 shares and approved material terms of the

contractual lives for SOs For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense is to be recognized once each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service We have preliminarily estimated service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement to be up to five years Stockbased compensation for t he marketbased tranche will be recognized using the derived service period for the marketbased metric achievement which we have initially estimated to be approximately three years In fiscal 1993 the Board adopted the 1993 Directors Stock Plan the Directors Plan which provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stockbased awards including

less than fair market value that vest over four years and expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant We currently grant RSUs only that vest fully on the oneyear anniversary of the date of grant The Directors Plan was most recently amended on April 29 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards to each

differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which US income taxes have not been provided was approximately 79 billion If the other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction At May 31 2019 assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately 15 billion Our net deferred tax assets were 24 billion and 13 billion as of May 31 2019 and 2018 respectively We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates

statements of operations of 312 million 127 million and 125 million during fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31 2019 and 2018 were 13 billion and 992 million respectively Domestically US federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2017 Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process the most significant of which include the deductibility of certain royalty payments transfer pricing extraterritorial income exemptions domestic production activity foreign tax credits and research and development credits taken With all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate we believe that it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2019 the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months by as much as 516 million 357 million net of offsetting tax benefits Our US federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods Our US state income tax returns with some exceptions have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods Internationally tax authorities for numerous nonUS jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits We believe that it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2019 the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both by as much as 186 million 87 million net of offsetting tax benefits in the next 12 months related primarily to transfer pricing 109 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2019 With some exceptions we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in nonUS jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 1997 We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits However there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof On June 7 2019 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversing a previous decision of the US Tax Court held that the US Treasury Departments regulations requiring the inclusion of stockbased compensation expense in a taxpayers costsharing calculations were valid Our financial statements have been prepared consistent with this outcome but we will continue to monitor any ongoing developments including the possibility of rehearing or appeal to the US Supreme Court to determine if future changes are required We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries including in particular Australia Brazil Canada India Indonesia South Korea Mexico Pakistan and Spain where the amounts under controversy are significant In some although not all cases we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary If our estimates of the federal state and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment it could result in a further charge to expense 110

standards for reporting information about operating segments Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker or decisionmaking group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance Our chief operating decision makers CODMs are our Chief Executive Officers and Chief Technology Officer We are organized by line of business and geographically While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed The footnote information below presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the companys performance and allocating company resources We have three businessescloud and license hardware and serviceseach of which is comprised of a single operating segment All three of our businesses market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes government agencies educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs Our cloud and license business engages in the sale marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and onpremise deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings and our cloud license and onpremise license offerings Cloud services and license support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly billed to customers in advance delivered to customers over time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms Cloud services and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available and for which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual term Cloud license and onpremise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses generally on a perpetual basis to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and onpremise IT environments We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to the customer to download and use which typically is immediately upon signature of the license contract In each fiscal year our cloud and license business contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter ie in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year as we receive payments from these contracts Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage industryspecific hardware operating systems virtualization management and other hardwarerelated software to support diverse IT environments Our hardware business also includes hardware support which provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software and can include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Our services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in

HewlettPackard Company Litigation On June 15 2011 HewlettPackard Company now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HP filed a complaint in the California Superior Court County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing defamation intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HPs Itaniumbased servers it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20 2010 between HP and Mark Hurd the Hurd Settlement Agreement who is our Chief Executive Officer and was both HPs former chief executive officer and chairman of HPs board of directors HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the Hurd Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief Oracle answered the complaint and filed crossclaims After a bench trial on the meaning of the Hurd Settlement Agreement the court found that the Hurd Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HPs Itaniumbased servers at no cost to HP The case proceeded to a jury trial in May 2016 On June 30 2016 the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on its crossclaims The jury awarded HP 30 billion in damages Under the courts rulings HP is entitled to postjudgment interest but not prejudgment interest on this award After the trial court denied Oracles motion for a new trial Oracle filed a notice of appeal on January 17 2017 On February 2 2017 HP filed a notice of appeal of the trial courts denial of prejudgment interest Oracle has posted a bond for the amounts owing No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations We continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HPs claims and we intend to present these defenses to the appellate court Oracle

to the complexities and uncertaint y surrounding the appeal process and the nature of the claims Litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of the appeal process related to this action is uncertain It is possible that the resolution of this action could have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracles NetSuite Acquisition On May 3 2017 a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and on July 18 2017 a second stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the same
