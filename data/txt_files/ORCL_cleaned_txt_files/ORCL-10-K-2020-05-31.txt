license business and hardware business are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues because certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term See Cloud and License Business and Selected Quarterly Financial Data in Item 7 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues expenses and margins Competition We face intense competition in all aspects of our business The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge expand or are acquired as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change Our customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation sourcing integration and ongoing maintenance of their IT environments Our enterprise cloud license and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world including Amazoncom Inc Microsoft Corporation International Business Machines Corporation IBM Intel Corporation Cisco Systems Inc Adobe Systems Incorporated Alphabet Inc and SAP SE as well as other companies like HewlettPackard Enterprise salesforcecom inc and Workday Inc In addition due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions or offerings focused on a specific functionality product area or industry In addition as we expand into new market segments we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed Moreover we or our competitors may take certain strategic actionsincluding acquisitions partnerships and joint ventures or repositioning of product lineswhich invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include total cost of ownership performance scalability reliability security functionality efficiency ease of use speed to production and quality of technical support Our product and service sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following among other factors market adoption of cloudbased IT offerings including SaaS and IaaS offerings the ease of deployment use transacting for and maintenance of our products and services offerings compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments including our Oracle Cloud environments the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors the broader platform competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the NET programming environment of Microsoft operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems with alternatives including Microsofts Windows Server and other UNIX and Linux operating systems the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers products features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff products features and functionality customized and implemented for customers by consultants systems integrators or other third parties and the attractiveness of offerings from business processing outsourcers For more information about the competitive risks we face refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report Available Information Our Annual Report on Form

environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict The following discussion as well as our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 highlights some of these risks The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities The COVID19 pandemic has affected how we and our customers are operating our respective businesses and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and our overall financial performance remains uncertain A novel strain of coronavirus COVID19 was first identified in late calendar year 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 The longterm impacts if any of the global COVID19 pandemic on our business are currently unknown We are conducting business as usual with modifications to employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of certain marketing events among other modifications We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stockholders It is not clear what the potential longterm effects of any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including the effects on our customers and prospects We have observed other companies including customers and partners taking precautionary and preemptive actions to address the COVID19 pandemic Such companies may take further actions that alter their normal business operations if there are future spikes of COVID19 infections resulting in additional government mandated shutdowns The conditions caused by the COVID19 pandemic have adversely affected our customers willingness to purchase our products and delayed prospective customers purchasing decisions The impacts of the global COVID19 pandemic on the broader global economy have been swift dramatic and unpredictable The latency and duration of these impacts are diverse across geographies and jurisdictions in which we market sell and develop our offerings The depth and duration of the current economic declines attributable to the COVID19 pandemic and any potential economic recoveries are not currently known In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we experienced revenue declines compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and delayed payments from customers The effect of the pandemic for fiscal 2021 and future periods is unknown If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of the COVID19 pandemic effectively our business will be harmed Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services Rapid technological advances intense competition changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand customers may not purchase or subscribe to our license hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business In addition we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly driving innovations in technology but if they fail to operate as anticipated or our other products do not perform as promised our business and reputation may be harmed 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition our busines s may be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames infrastructure costs to deliver new or enhanced products and services take longer or result in greater costs than anticipated there is a delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customers to new enhanced or acquired product lines or services there are changes in information technology IT trends that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development efforts we do not optimize complementary product lines and services in a timely manner or we fail to adequately integrate support or enhance acquired product lines or services Our Oracle Cloud strategy including our Oracle Cloud SoftwareasaService and InfrastructureasaService SaaS and IaaS respectively and collectively Oracle Cloud Services offerings may adversely affect our revenues and profitability We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via deployment models that best suit their needs including via our cloudbased SaaS and IaaS offerings As these business models continue to evolve we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and onpremise license and hardware product arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements Customers generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions Consequently any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations This is in contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products In addition we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transition from or be able to sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for our license hardware and support offerings relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of and demand for our Oracle Cloud Services which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability We might experience significant coding manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud license and hardware offerings Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service our cloud license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding manufacturing or configuration errors that can impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly Errors in our cloud license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function integrate or operate with other cloud license or hardware offerings could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services This includes thirdparty software products or services incorporated into our own If we experience errors or delays in releasing our cloud license or hardware offerings or new versions of these offerings our sales could be affected and revenues could decline In addition we run Oracles business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks Therefore any flaws could affect our and our customers abilities to conduct business operations and to ensure accuracy in financial processes and reporting and may result in unanticipated costs Enterprise customers rely on our cloud license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud license and hardware offerings and related services could expose us to product liability 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation which could impact our future sales If our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result our data our customers data or our IT systems are accessed improperly made unavailable or improperly modified our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable our brand and reputation could be damaged the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using our products and services all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions We are in the IT business and our products and services including our Oracle Cloud Services store retrieve manipulate and manage our customers information and data external data as well as our own data We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products services and the internal and external data that we manage At times we encounter attempts by third parties which may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations such as statesponsored organizations nation states and individuals sponsored by them to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities penetrate or bypass our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers partners and suppliers software hardware and cloud offerings networks and systems any of which could lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers Computer hackers and others may be able to develop and deploy IT related viruses worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our networks systems products and services exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our networks systems products and services create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service This is also true for thirdparty data products or services incorporated into our own Our products and services including our Oracle Cloud Services may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer partner employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers partners employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data our customers suppliers or partners data or the IT systems of Oracle our customers suppliers or partners Security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting IT products and businesses Although this is an industrywide problem that affects software and hardware companies generally it affects Oracle in particular because computer hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most prominent IT companies and they may focus on Oracle because of our reputation for and marketing efforts associated with having secure products and services These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of data including personal information and our customers confidential information and data and host or manage parts of our customers businesses in cloudbased IT environments especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences financial services retail hospitality and the government We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies products services and technologies over the years While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage IT systems change frequently grow more complex over time and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques Our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adopters of new technologies However our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge In addition we often experience increased activity of this nature during times of instability including during the COVID19 pandemic when our operations may be more susceptible to malfeasance due to operational changes instituted to comply with safety health and regulatory requirements among others We may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach We could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers or suppliers data other external data or our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted or if our products or services are reported to have or are perceived as having security vulnerabilities Customers could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services including our cloud offerings and perceive them to not be 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements secure This could lead to fewer customers using our products and services and result in reduced revenue s and earnings The costs we would incur to address and fix these security incidents would increase our expenses These types of security incidents could also lead to loss or destruction of information inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data lawsuits indemnity obligations regulatory investigations and financial penalties and claims and increased legal liability including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is a security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims customer dissatisfaction reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position Our business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation legal requirements or industry standards relating to privacy and data protection As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify In addition US and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations in a manner that could significantly impact our ability as well as the ability of our customers partners and data providers to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide In the wake of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation GDPR the rate of global consideration and adoption of privacy laws has increased giving rise to more global jurisdictions in which regulatory inquiries and audits may be requested of Oracle and if we are not deemed to be in compliance could result in enforcement actions andor fines This is true in the US where the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA became effective in January 2020 the US Congress is considering several privacy bills at the federal level and other state legislatures are considering privacy laws Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations The GDPR which became effective in May 2018 provides for monetary penalties of up to 4 of an organizations worldwide revenue These penalties can be significant For example one European data protection regulator has fined a major US technology company EUR 50 million for its data handling practices The US Federal Trade Commission continues to fine companies on a regular basis for unfair and deceptive data protection practices and these fines may increase in size The CCPA provides for statutory damages on a per violation basis that could be very large in the event of a significant data security breach or other CCPA violation Taken together the changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of data could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to data protection and our cost of providing our products and services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate Although we have implemented contracts policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors partners data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts policies and procedures Additionally public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to provide certain products and services We make statements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy information provided on our website and press statements Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these public statements or with US federal state or foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations regulating privacy data security or consumer protection public perception standards selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in lost or restricted business proceedings actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation Economic political and market conditions can adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting These include 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements general economic and business conditions overall demand for enterprise cloud license and hardware products and services governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities and general legal regulatory and political developments Macroeconomic developments like the United Kingdom leaving the EU Brexit evolving trade policies between the US and international trade partners or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic political or market conditions could negatively affect our business operating results financial condition and outlook which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Any general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services In addition international regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world public health crises such as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID19 and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and onpremise license hardware and related services and to a lesser extent also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our subscriptionbased cloud offerings If we are unable to compete effectively the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed We face intense competition in all aspects of our business The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge expand or are acquired as technology evolves and as delivery models change Many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructure technologies including databases middleware products application development tools business applications collaboration products and business intelligence compute storage and networking products among others which compete with Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings Use of our competitors technologies influences a customers purchasing decision or creates an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize or migrate to Oracle products and services Our competitors may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services at a risk profile that we may not generally find acceptable which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products add new functionality acquire competitive products reduce prices better execute on their sales and marketing strategies offer more flexible business practices or form strategic alliances with other companies We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully The intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices introduce pricing models and offerings that are less favorable to us or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully Any such changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely affect operating results Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license hardware and services offerings and we may also incur increased cloud delivery expenses as we expand our cloud operations and update our infrastructure all of which could reduce our revenues andor profitability Our license support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees respectively Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We introduced Oracle Bring Your Own License BYOL and Universal Credit Pricing to simplify the way customers purchase and consume our cloud services Oracle BYOL enables customers to maintain their existing software licenses for Oracle Infrastructure while expanding their IaaS footprint at a discounted price Oracle Universal Credit Pricing provides a flexible model for customers to access Oracle Infrastructure services on demand via a single contract Any future changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy commit to large customer deployments at prices that are unprofitable or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations These practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the US Our international operations include cloud operations cloud software and hardware development manufacturing assembly sales customer support consulting and other services and shared administrative service centers Compliance with international and US laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions These laws and regulations include US laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws foreign currencyrelated regulations anticompetition regulations antibribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA market access regulations tariffs and import export and general trade regulations including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business including the loss of trade privileges Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results Compliance with these laws requires a significant amount of management attention and effort which may divert managements attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded Where circumstances warrant we provide information and report our findings to government authorities and in some circumstances such authorities conduct their own investigations and we respond to their requests or demands for information No assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove effective We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally including those related to general economic conditions including the latency in economic impacts and associated economic recoveries if any in each country or region public health risks social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks particularly in areas in which we have significant operations fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts on customer demand and our operating results difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation of our net assets in particular our cash assets in that countrys currency 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements regulatory changes including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries political unrest terrorism and the potential for other hostilities common local business behaviors that are in direct conflict with our business ethics practices and conduct policies natural disasters the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding wildfires and increased storm sensitivity longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable overlapping tax regimes and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operations for our hardware business and the sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited a publicly traded company in India and Oracle Corporation Japan a publicly traded company in Japan we are faced with several additional risks including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if these entities were whollyowned subsidiaries Any failure to offer highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure offerings We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services or may be inefficient in our resolution of customer support issues Increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results Any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality technical support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors Our revenues particularly certain of our cloud license and onpremise license revenues and hardware revenues can be difficult to forecast As a result our quarterly operating results can fluctuate For our Oracle Cloud Services our actual conversion or renewal rates may differ from those used in our forecasts because this business is continuing to evolve and such rates may be unpredictable which could have an adverse effect on our longterm results For our license business we use a pipeline system a common industry practice to forecast sales and trends in that business Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline Our pipeline estimates can be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate A reduction in the conversion rates renewal rates or in the pipeline itself could adversely affect our business or results of operations In particular sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those being experienced with the COVID19 pandemic a slowdown in IT spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rates and renewal rates in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled The conversion rates can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms which can also impede our ability to negotiate execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner In addition for newly acquired companies we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements will convert into sales or revenues for a number of quarters following the acquisition Conversion rates and renewal rates postacquisition may be quite different from the acquired companies historical conversion rates Differences in conversion rates and renewal rates can also be affected by changes in business practices that we implement in our newly acquired companies These changes may negatively affect customer behavior A substantial portion of the revenue value of our cloud license and onpremise license and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter and a significant percentage of these are larger value orders Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability The number of large license transactions and to a lesser extent hardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions We may experience foreign currency gains and losses Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the US Dollar Changes in the values of major foreign currencies particularly the Euro Japanese Yen and British Pound relative to the US Dollar can significantly affect our total assets revenues operating results and cash flows which are reported in US Dollars In particular the economic uncertainties relating to Brexit and European sovereign and other debt obligations may cause the value of the British Pound and Euro to fluctuate relative to the US Dollar Fluctuations in foreign currency rates including the strengthening of the US Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in US Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into US Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currencybased enterprises to purchase In addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the US Generally our reported revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens In addition our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits among other assets are held in foreign currencies and reported in US Dollars In addition we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term which are charged to earnings in the period incurred We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures We may suspend the program from time to time As part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses A large portion of our consolidated operations are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts For example we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or costeffective to hedge our foreign currency exposures if our hedging efforts are ineffective or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the US Dollar We could incur future losses in emerging market countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationary Our periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive We are currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes product changes performance issues change in strategies acquisitions and other internal 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and external considerations These types of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities In addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these restructurings or may not do so within the expected timeframe These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management including our Chairman of the Board of Directors Chief Technology Officer and founder our Chief Executive Officer other members of our executive team and other key employees In the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel With rare exceptions we do not have longterm employment or noncompetition agreements with our employees Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additional departures which may be disruptive to our operations We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs When we make adjustments to our workforce we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program In addition changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent Our general compensation program includes restricted stock units and performancebased equity which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry If our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stockbased compensation which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel Our sales to government clients expose us to business volatility and risks including government budgeting cycles and appropriations procurement regulations governmental policy shifts early termination of contracts audits investigations sanctions and penalties We derive revenues from contracts with the US government state and local governments and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award administration and performance of those contracts Governmental entities are variously pursuing policies that affect our ability to sell our products and services Changes in government procurement policy priorities regulations technology initiatives and requirements andor contract award criteria may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector For example the US Department of Defense DoD has issued cybersecurity requirements for contractors internal systems through a mandatory cybersecurity contract clause referred to as DFARS 7012 and will be implementing a new thirdparty accreditation program known as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification CMMC The DFARS 7012 and CMMC requirements may impact our lines of business in the US federal government market Compliance with these cybersecurity requirements is complex and costly and failure to meet the required security controls could limit our ability to sell products and services directly or indirectly to the DoD and other federal government entities that implement similar cybersecurity requirements We are also subject to early termination of our contracts Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time without cause For example the US federal government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts at its convenience or for default based on our performance 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements US federal contracts are subject to the congressional approval of appropriations to fund the expenditures under these contracts Similarly our contracts with US state and local governments foreign governments and their agencies are generally subject to government funding authorizations Contracts may be terminated based upon a lack of appropriated funds There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending as governments continue to face significant deficit reduction pressures This may adversely impact spending on government programs Government contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations If violations of law are found they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business Acquisitions present many risks and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction We continue to review and consider strategic acquisitions of companies products services and technologies We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include our ongoing business may be disrupted and our managements attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities we may have difficulties 1 managing an acquired companys technologies or lines of business 2 entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions or 3 retaining key personnel from the acquired companies an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected we may impose our business practices or alter gotomarket strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by 1 claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition including among others claims from government agencies terminated employees current or former customers former stockholders or other third parties 2 preexisting contractual relationships that we assume from an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business 3 unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired companys practices and 4 intellectual property claims or disputes we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology which could result in 1 unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure 2 unfavorable accounting treatment 3 unexpected increases in taxes due or the loss of anticipated tax benefits or 4 other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition we may not realize any anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons including 1 if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew cloudbased subscription contracts or license support or hardware support contracts 2 if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base 3 if acquired customers do not elect to purchase our technologies due to differing business practices or 4 if contract models utilized by an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues on a timely basis 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technologies products services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of business and supply chain infrastructure and maintaining uniform standards architecture controls procedures and policies we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered priced delivered and supported differently which could cause customer confusion and delays we may incur higher than anticipated costs 1 to support develop and deliver acquired products or services 2 for general and administrative functions that support new business models or 3 to comply with regulations applicable to an acquired business that are more complicated than we had anticipated we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from or may otherwise have certain limitations restrictions penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition which could adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions and potentially increase our integration and restructuring expenses we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis if at all which could among other things 1 delay or prevent us from completing a transaction 2 adversely affect our integration plans in certain jurisdictions 3 restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or 4 have other adverse effects on our current business and operations our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash including 1 stock repurchases 2 dividend payments and 3 retirement of outstanding indebtedness among others we may significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms to the extent that we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease and we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to US generally accepted accounting principles including arrangements that we may assume in an acquisition The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions Our hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues and overall profitability and related growth rates We may not achieve our estimated revenue profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors including our changes in hardware offerings technologies and strategies including shifting factory locations which could adversely affect supply and demand for our hardware products our hardware business has higher expenses as a percentage of revenues and thus has been less profitable than our cloud and license business our focus on certain of our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems and certain other hardware products we consider strategic and the deemphasis of certain of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products could adversely affect our hardware revenues changes in strategies and frequency for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products could adversely affect our hardware revenues 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements general supply chain material shortages worldwide prior to the outbreak of COVID19 which we expect will be further exacerbated globally as a result of the virus pandemic a greater risk of material charges that could adversely affect our operating results such as potential writedowns and impairments of our inventories higher warranty expenses than what we experience in our cloud and license and services businesses and amortization and potential impairment of intangible assets associated with our hardware business decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives which could adversely affect our hardware revenues and we may acquire hardware companies that are strategically important to us but 1 operate in hardware businesses with historically lower operating margins than our own 2 have different legacy business practices and gotomarket strategies than our own that we may alter as a part of our integration efforts which may significantly impact our estimated revenues and profits from the acquired company 3 leverage different platforms or competing technologies that we may encounter difficulties in integrating or 4 utilize unique manufacturing processes that affect our ability to scale these acquired products within our own manufacturing operations Our hardware offerings are complex products and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity the results of our hardware business will suffer We depend on suppliers to develop manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price quality technology availability or other business constraints As a result our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages natural disasters political unrest public health crises such as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID19 changes to trade policies port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience significant shortages delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies parts or components from a particular vendor If one or more of the risks described above occurs our hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected We are susceptible to thirdparty manufacturing and logistics delays which could result in the loss of sales and customers We outsource the manufacturing assembly delivery and technology or component design of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the US From time to time these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products To reduce this risk we continue to explore additional thirdparty manufacturing partners to drive supply chain continuity but finding additional manufacturing sources in a timely and costeffective manner is difficult Thirdparty manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID19 caused a loss of sales during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses all of which could adversely affect the margins of our hardware business These challenges and risks also exist when we acquire companies with hardware products and related supply chain operations and could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies suppliers or locations In some cases we may be dependent at least initially on these acquired companies supply chain operations or other manufacturing operations that we are less familiar with and thus we may be slower to adjust or react to these challenges and risks Our cloud and license and hardware indirect sales channels could affect our future operating results Our cloud and license and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers system integratorsimplementers consultants education providers internet service providers network integrators and independent software vendors Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud software and hardware marketing and sales efforts Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements participant if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants products and services were to decrease There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants If we are not successful we may lose sales opportunities customers and revenues We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights We rely on copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights Despite our efforts these protections may be limited Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property Any patents owned by us may be invalidated circumvented or challenged Any of our pending or future patent applications whether or not being currently challenged may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek if at all In addition the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property rights as do the laws and courts of the US If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive Third parties have claimed and in the future may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights andor breach of license agreement provisions We periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them These third parties include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse We expect to continue to receive such claims as we continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows the use and support of thirdparty code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the industry the volume of issued patents continues to increase and nonpracticing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments Responding to any such claim regardless of its validity could be time consuming costly and result in litigation divert managements time and attention from developing our business require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products require us to release source code to third parties possibly under open source license terms require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers or otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all Developing our various product offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired Accelerated product and service introductions and short lifecycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position However we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all Business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the US We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems supply chains and processes could cause delays in completing sales providing services including some of our cloud offerings and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back office processes A major earthquake or fire political social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change such as increased storm severity drought and pandemics that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business supply chains or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected Adverse litigation results could affect our business We are subject to various legal proceedings Litigation can be lengthy expensive and disruptive to our operations and can divert our managements attention away from running our core business The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business operating results or financial condition Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities As a multinational corporation we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the US and various foreign jurisdictions Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the amount of our tax liabilities including those arising from potential changes in laws in the countries in which we do business and the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities and we are regularly under audit by tax authorities which often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns Any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate Increasingly countries around the world are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations In particular the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the Tax Act significantly changed how corporations are taxed in the US which has an ongoing impact on our provision for income taxes The US Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service IRS and other standardssetting bodies are continuing to issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied and it is possible that the guidance may differ from our interpretation of the legislation The Tax Act requires complex computations not previously required or produced and necessitates that we make significant judgments and assumptions in the interpretation of the law where there is a lack of guidance Such uncertainty in the application of the Tax Act to our ongoing operations as well as possible adverse future law changes attributable to changes in the US political landscape create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income taxes and could have an adverse impact on our future tax rate Various Democratic proposals would partially or wholly reverse beneficial features of the Tax Act such as by raising the US corporate tax rate and increasing the tax on nonUS income A change in party control of the White House and US Senate thus could lead to dramatic changes in the tax law and result in an increase in our provision for income taxes Increased federal and state fiscal spending to fund COVID19 relief measures coupled with a drop in tax revenue from pandemicrelated reductions in economic activity will add to the pressure to raise more tax revenue from federal and state corporate income and other taxes or to enact new types of taxes on businesses and their customers Other countries also continue to consider enacting changes to their tax laws that could adversely affect us by increasing taxes imposed on our revenue streams and foreign subsidiaries including changes in withholding tax regimes and the imposition of taxes targeted at certain technology businesses More fundamentally longstanding international tax principles that determine each countrys right to tax crossborder transactions are being 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements reconsidered creating significant uncertainty as to the future level of corporate income tax on our international operations This reexamination is driven by a perceived need to provide greater taxing rights to market jurisdictions where customers or users are located Various measures are being discussed including adjustments to transfer pricing rules limitations on deductions and imposition of additional withholding taxes The foregoing changes brought about by the Tax Act in combination with the uncertain international tax environment have upended expectations and the predictability and reliability of the global tax system leading to the ongoing reevaluation of our global legal and tax operating structure The resulting potential modifications to our structure could adversely impact our provision for income taxes Inherent in our global business operations and legal entity structure are many intercompany transactions and calculations made in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Our intercompany transfer pricing has been and is currently being reviewed by the IRS and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future Although we have negotiated a number of agreements with certain taxing jurisdictions these agreements do not cover substantial elements of our transfer pricing In recent periods transfer pricing audits in many foreign jurisdictions have become increasingly contentious Similarly certain jurisdictions are increasingly raising concerns about certain withholding tax matters under current law In addition our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by shifts of earnings from jurisdictions or regimes that have relatively lower statutory tax rates to those in which the rates are relatively higher We are also subject to nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the US and various foreign jurisdictions that have uncertain applicability to the businesses in which we are engaged Although we believe that our income and nonincome based tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness As of May 31 2020 we had an aggregate of 716 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2020 and calendar year 2060 and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt Furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase Should we incur future increases in interest expense our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our US federal income tax could be limited which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate In addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs Some of our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state federal and international laws governing protection of the environment proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products human health and safety the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers as well as local testing and labelling requirements Compliance with these everchanging environmental and other laws in a timely manner could increase our product design development procurement manufacturing delivery cloud operations and administration costs limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete noncompliant inventory change our sales activities or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability including fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Regulatory market and competitive pressures regarding the greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations may also grow The SEC has adopted disclosure requirements for companies that use certain conflict minerals tantalum tin tungsten and gold in their products Our supply chain is multitiered global and highly complex As a provider of hardware endproducts we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain Accordingly our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited Our relationships with customers and suppliers could suffer if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree We may also face increased costs in complying with conflict minerals disclosure requirements A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales Environmental legislation such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances RoHS the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive WEEE Directive and Chinas regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements The UK Government has announced a procurement policy that includes environmental social and economic sustainability measures Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value All of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price The timing of announcements in the public market by us or by our competitors regarding new products product enhancements technological advances acquisitions or major transactions could also affect our stock price Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price Our stock price could also be affected by factors some of which are beyond our control including among others speculation in the press and the analyst community changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock negative analyst surveys or channel check surveys earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors expectations our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources which could adversely affect our business We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value In fiscal 2020 our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling 300 billion The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and even if fully implemented may not enhance longterm stockholder value Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results Under business combination accounting standards pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805 Business Combinations we recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and in each case separately from goodwill Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred which is also generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain After we complete an acquisition the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flows costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention redeployment or relocation expenses impairment of goodwill or impairment of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets acquired a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities both income tax and nonincome tax related

operating results to maintain certain duplicative premerger activities for an extended period of time or to maintain these activities for a period of time that is longer than we had anticipated charges to eliminate certain duplicative premerger activities and charges to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure charges to our operating results due to expenses incurred to effect the acquisition and charges to our operating results due to the expensing of certain stock awards assumed in an acquisition Substantially all of these costs will be accounted for as expenses that will adversely impact our operating results for the periods in which those costs are incurred Charges to our operating results in any given period could differ substantially from other periods

ended May 31 2019 2 Working capital and total assets increased in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2020 net income and the issuance of 200 billion of longterm senior notes in fiscal 2020 partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in fiscal 2020 Working capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019 primarily due to 361 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2019 net income Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in the fiscal 2016 to 2018 periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuance of longterm senior notes of 100 billion in fiscal 2018 and 140 billion in fiscal 2017 These working capital and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in the fiscal 2016 to 2018 periods presented In addition our total assets were also affected in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussed further below 3 Our notes payable and other borrowings which represented the summation of our notes payable current and notes payable and other borrowings noncurrent as reported per our consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above increased during fiscal 2020 primarily due to the issuance of 200 billion of longterm senior notes Notes payable and other borrowings decreased during fiscal 2019 primarily due to repayments of certain shortterm borrowings and senior notes Notes payable and other borrowings increased between fiscal 2016 and 2018 primarily due to the fiscal 2018 issuance of longterm senior notes of 100 billion and shortterm borrowings of 25 billion the fiscal 2017 issuance of longterm senior notes of 140 billion and shortterm borrowings of 38 billion and fiscal 2016 shortterm borrowings of 38

and Results of Operations We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition Business Overview Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology IT environments Our products and services include applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models These models include onpremise deployments cloudbased deployments and hybrid deployments an approach that combines both onpremise and cloudbased deployment such as our Oracle Cloud at Customer offering an instance of Oracle Cloud in a customers own data center Accordingly we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers needs Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes government agencies educational institutions and resellers We have three businesses cloud and license hardware and services each of which comprises a single operating segment The descriptions set forth below as a part of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers CODMs which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer view our operating results and allocate resources Impacts of the COVID19 Pandemic on Oracles Business For a discussion of the impacts on and risks to our business from COVID19 please refer to Impacts of the COVID19 Pandemic on Oracles Business included in Item 1 Business in this Annual Report the risks included in Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report and the information presented below in Results of Operations in this Item 7 Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license line of business which represented 83 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019 markets sells and delivers a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings Cloud services and license support revenues include license support revenues which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud onpremise and other IT environments Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements which current license support customers are entitled to receive License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license andor onpremise license are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed are generally renewed at the customers option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided which is generally one year and cloud services revenues which provide customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloudbased deployment models that Oracle develops provides unspecified updates and enhancements for hosts manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period The majority of our Oracle Cloud Services 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed have durations of one to three years are generally renewed at the customers option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or in the case of usage model contracts as the cloud services are consumed over time Cloud license and onpremise license revenues include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications Oracle Database Oracle Middleware and Java among others which our customers deploy within cloud based on premise and other IT environments Our cloud license and on premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use Revenues from usage based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and onpremise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point in time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms Cloud license and onpremise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts as described above Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy our applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy In recent periods customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased To address customer demand and enable customer choice we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads We expect these trends to continue Our cloud and license business revenue growth is affected by many factors including the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses the pricing amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold and foreign currency rate fluctuations On a constant currency basis we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings and continued demand for our cloud license and onpremise license offerings We believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business revenues which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development to develop and improve our cloud and license products and services Our cloud and license business margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably the renewal of existing customers cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues ratably and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and onpremise license revenues which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery in each case over those four quarterly periods 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Hardware Business Our hardware business which represented 9 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019 provides a broad selection of hardware products and hardwarerelated software products including Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage industryspecific hardware offerings operating systems virtualization management and other hardwarerelated software and related hardware support Each hardware product and its related software such as an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and valueadded resellers Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services including direct materials and labor costs Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict Our hardware revenues cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors including our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings customer demand for competing offerings including cloud infrastructure offerings the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products which have a finite life and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available and foreign currency rate fluctuations Services Business Our services business which represented 8 of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019 helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies extensive experience broad sets of intellectual property and best practices Our services offerings include consulting services advanced customer services and education services Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for and the competitive position of our services customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the associated services for these offerings general economic conditions governmental budgetary constraints personnel reductions in our customers IT departments and tighter controls over customer discretionary spending Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy Historically we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies products services and technologies The pace of our acquisitions has slowed recently but as compelling opportunities become available we may acquire companies products services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy Note 2 of 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings operating margin cash flows and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC GAAP as set forth within the ASC requires us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent that there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our financial statements will be affected The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include Revenue Recognition Business Combinations Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments Accounting for Income Taxes and Legal and Other Contingencies Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information about our critical and other accounting policies Revenue Recognition The most critical judgments required in applying Topic 606 and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price SSP for each performance obligation Many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency Therefore multiple products and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes We allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP the determination of SSP is discussed below for each performance obligation within each contract We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is delivered We use historical sales transaction data and judgment among other factors in determining the SSP for products and services For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and onpremise licenses we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change SSP for our products and services can 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition changes in demand for our products and services and economic factors among others Our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts that is the selling price is highly variable and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence As a result the SSP for a cloud license and an onpremise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and onpremise license revenues Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations in accounting for our acquisitions ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets or to an acquisition of a business A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of a business acquisitions measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets contractual obligations assumed preacquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration where applicable Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results For a given business acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a nonincome tax related preacquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business and other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerations macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions These estimates and assumptions include among others revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist In such situations we are required to evaluate whether the net book values of our finite lived intangible assets are recoverable We determine whether finite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and include among others forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts Accounting for Income Taxes Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision In the ordinary course of a global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located We consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements realized we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known which can materially impact our effective tax rate The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740 Income Taxes which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit judicial rulings and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable Because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made As additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Results of Operations Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information In our fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 results of operations discussion below we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues total consolidated expenses and total consolidated operating margin all of which are presented on a GAAP basis We also present a GAAPbased discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses In addition we discuss below the fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 results of each our three businessescloud and license hardware and serviceswhich are our operating segments as defined

financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended May 31 2019 as filed with the SEC on June 21 2019 which is available free of charge on the SECs website at wwwsecgov and on our Investor Relations website at wwworaclecominvestor Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses revenues and expenses As a result each businesses revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the US Dollar against major international currencies In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure To present this information current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US Dollars are converted into US Dollars at constant exchange rates ie the rates in effect on May 31 2019 which was the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods For example if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 10 million Euros from products sold on May 31 2020 and 2019 our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of 110 million in fiscal 2020 using 110 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period and 111 million in fiscal 2019 using 111 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period The constant currency presentation however would translate the fiscal 2020 results using the fiscal 2019 exchange rate and indicate in this example no change in revenues during either period In each of the tables below we present the percent change based on actual unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31 Percent Change Dollars in millions 2020 Actual Constant 2019 Total Revenues by Geography Americas 21563 1 1 21856 EMEA 1 11035 2 1

Business Cloud and license 83 83 Hardware 9 9 Services 8 8 1 Comprised of Europe the Middle East and Africa Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations our total revenues were flat in fiscal 2020 The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business revenues during fiscal 2020 was offset by decreases in our hardware business revenues and services business revenues The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud deployment models and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to our latest technologies and support services The constant currency decrease in our hardware business revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was due to reductions in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloudbased infrastructure technologies which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts The constant currency decrease in our services business revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to declines in our consulting revenues and education revenues Due to the effects of the COVID19 pandemic all three of our businesses revenues were adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and some of these effects may continue into fiscal 2021 While we expect these effects to be temporary the impacts of COVID19 for fiscal 2021 and future periods are unknown On a constant currency basis fiscal 2020 total revenues growth in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions were partially offset by a decline in the Americas region Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations our total operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower expenses for substantially all of our operating expense categories other than cloud services and license support expenses which increased primarily due to headcount and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business revenues and research and development expenses which increased primarily due to higher stockbased compensation expenses We curtailed a number of variable expenditures in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 including marketing 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements expenses and employee travel expenses in response to COVID19 We expect certain of these expenses to normalize in future periods provided global economic conditions improve In constant currency our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2020 due to the decline in our total expenses Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges To supplement our consolidated financial information we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business

our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term which is generally one year Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloudbased deployment models that we develop provide unspecified updates and enhancements for host manage and support Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term which is generally one to three years or in the case of usage model contracts as the cloud services are consumed Cloud license and onpremise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses generally on a perpetual basis to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and onpremise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use We continue to place significant emphasis both domestically and internationally on direct sales through our own sales force We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses and sales and marketing expenses These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our

infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and license business revenues These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenses which

sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems server storage and industryspecific hardware offerings The hardware product and related software such as an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the

customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term which is generally one year The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and valueadded resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal

fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to lower hardware products revenues and lower hardware support revenues The decreases in hardware products and hardware support revenues in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 were primarily attributable to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloudbased infrastructure technologies which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our

meetings In addition we incurred lower billable travel expenses and lower billable subcontractor expenses for which we were to be reimbursed by our customers which reduced the amount of revenues and expenses we reported for this business during fiscal 2020 In constant currency total services expenses were flat in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as lower expenses incurred for travel and

Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the US federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings

associated with our adoption of Topic 842 as of June 1 2019 Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods the amounts and timing of which are variable Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks Tier1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and certain other securities The increase in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31 2020 in comparison to May 31 2019 was primarily due to our issuance of 200 billion of longterm senior notes in April 2020 cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises during fiscal 2020 These cash inflows were partially offset by certain cash outflows primarily 192 billion used for repurchases of our common stock the repayment of 45 billion of borrowings payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures The amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the

customers following the purchase and renewal of their license support agreements Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts terms which are generally one year in length Over the course of a fiscal year we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses cloud services hardware offerings and other services Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products taxes interest payments and leased facilities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower net income and certain cash unfavorable changes in the timing of payments received from customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 which we believe were attributable to the unfavorable global economic effects that resulted from COVID19 We expect to collect substantially all of these delayed customer payments in future periods Cash flows from investing activities The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities and investments in capital and other assets including certain intangible assets to support our growth 54 Table of Contents

securities and other investments and a fiscal 2020 increase in the purchase of marketable securities and other investments in each case relative to fiscal 2019 Cash flows from financing activities The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments stock repurchases dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in our stock repurchases for which we used 192 billion in fiscal

purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the payment We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture subassemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon leadtimes andor commercially standard leadtimes for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way As of May 31 2020 we had 84 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits including related interest and penalties recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2021 We are involved in claims and legal proceedings All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which are out of our control Notes 14 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information regarding these contingencies We believe that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash

component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders We recognize that restricted stockbased awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stockbased awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages Consistent with these dual goals our cumulative potential dilution since June 1 2017 has been a weightedaverage annualized rate of 15 per year The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stockbased awards and stock options granted and assumed net of restricted stockbased awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company divided by the weightedaverage outstanding shares during the calculation period This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stockbased awards vest and stock options are exercised Of the outstanding stock options at May 31 2020 which generally have a tenyear exercise period substantially all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date In recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stockbased compensation program However we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions to pay dividends to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes As of May 31 2020 the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stockbased awards and unexercised stock options regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date was 90 During fiscal 2020 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organizationwide stockbased award grants to selected employees all stockbased award grants to senior officers and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62500 or greater The annual organizationwide stockbased award grants to selected employees are generally approved by the Compensation Committee during the ten business day period following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report However we currently do not expect that the annual grant for fiscal 2021 will be approved during this time period Each member of a separate executive officer committee referred to as the Plan Committee was allocated a fiscal 2020 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization subject to certain limitations

recent accounting pronouncements if any and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements if any see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Cash Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 431 billion and 378 billion as of May 31 2020 and 2019 respectively Our bank deposits and time deposits are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investmentgrade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investmentgrade ratings criteria which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks In addition as of May 31 2020 substantially all of our marketable securities were high quality with substantially all having maturity dates within one year a description of our marketable securities held is included in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and Liquidity and Capital Resources above We held a mix of both fixed and floatingrate debt securities Fixed rate securities may have their market values adversely impacted as interest rates increase while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall Due in part to these factors our future investment income may vary due to changes in interest rates or we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be otherthantemporary The fair values of our fixedrate debt securities are impacted by interest rate movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of each of May 31 2020 and 2019 we estimate the change would have decreased the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by 15 million and 128 million respectively We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities For fiscal 2020 and 2019 total interest income was 527 million and 11 billion respectively with our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities investments yielding an average 147 and 208 respectively on a worldwide basis 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Expense Risk Interest Expense Risk Interest Rate Swap Agreements and CrossCurrency Interest Rate Swap Agreements Our total borrowings were 716 billion as of May 31 2020 consisting of 715 billion of fixedrate borrowings and 113 million of other borrowings As of May 31 2020 we held certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our 15 billion of 280 fixedrate senior notes due July 2021 July 2021 Notes so that the fixedrate interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR We have also entered into crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our 750 million of 3125 fixedrate senior notes due July 2025 Notes July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixedrate Euro denominated debt including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to variablerate US Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2021 Notes and July 2025 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to including the notional amounts and maturity dates We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes We are accounting for these swap agreements as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 The fair values of our outstanding fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements as of May 31 2020 and 2019 were a 12 million net gain and a 17 million net loss respectively We estimate that the changes in the fair values of these swap agreements as of May 31 2020 and 2019 respectively were primarily attributable to a decrease and increase respectively in forward interest rate prices If LIBORbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points as of May 31 2020 and 2019 the change would have decreased the collective fair values of the fixed to variable swap agreements by 63 million and 90 million respectively By entering into the aforementioned swap arrangements we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates As of May 31 2020 and 2019 if LIBORbased interest rates would have been higher by 100 basis points the change would have increased our interest expense annually by approximately 24 million and 52 million respectively as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements and related borrowings and as of May 31 2019 as it related to our floatingrate borrowings Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report Currency Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk Foreign Currency Forward Contracts We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration We neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations Given the short duration of the forward contracts amounts recorded generally are not significant The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position The statement of operations classification for 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements changes in fair values of these forward contracts is nonoperating income net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors The notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 42 billion and 38 billion as of May 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 39 billion and 33 billion as of May 31 2020 and 2019 respectively The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31 2020 and 2019 Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in nonoperating income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were 185 million and 111 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future the amounts and timing of which are unknown Foreign Currency Translation RiskImpact on Cash Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into US Dollars In particular the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is substantially recorded to AOCL on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report As the US Dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2020 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in US Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31 2020 decreased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate from May 31 2019 As reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in US Dollars was a decrease of 125 million and 158 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the US Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10 as of May 31 2020 and May 31 2019 the amount of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in US Dollars would have decreased by approximately 491 million and 434 million respectively assuming constant foreign currency cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The response to this item is submitted as a

of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10K we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a15e and 15d15e 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Based on our managements evaluation with the participation of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report our Principal Executive and Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our management including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding

such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a15f and 15d15f Under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2020 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commissions 2013 framework Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP Based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31 2020 We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2020 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of Exchange Act Rules 13a15 or 15d15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level However our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud A control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met Further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake Additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate Because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements

various claims and legal proceedings The Company accrues a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated For purposes of disclosure the Company also performs an assessment of the materiality of legal contingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued The audit of the Companys accounting for and disclosure of legal contingencies is highly subjective and requires significant judgment in assessing the Companys evaluation of the probability of a loss and the estimated amount or range of loss These judgments are impacted by uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of the legal contingencies the status of the litigation or the appeals processes and the status of any settlement discussions associated with the legal contingencies How we addressed the matter in our audit We obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the identification and evaluation of these matters including controls over managements assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss and whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable Our substantive audit procedures among others included gaining an understanding of the status of ongoing lawsuits reviewing letters addressing the matters from internal and external legal counsel meetings with internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations and obtaining a representation letter from management on these matters We also evaluated the Companys disclosures in relation to these matters s Ernst Young LLP We have served as the Companys auditor

substantially address all aspects of enterprise information technology IT environments including applications and infrastructure We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models including cloudbased Cloud at Customer an instance of Oracle Cloud in the customers own data center on premise and hybrid models Oracle Cloud SoftwareasaService and InfrastructureasaService SaaS and IaaS respectively and collectively Oracle Cloud Services offerings provide a comprehensive and integrated stack of applications and infrastructure services delivered via cloudbased deployment models that Oracle deploys hosts upgrades supports and manages for the customer Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloudbased or onpremise IT environments Customers that purchase our software products may elect to purchase license support contracts which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977 Basis of Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracles stockholders for all periods presented The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of nonoperating income net in our consolidated statements of operations Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated In fiscal 2020 we adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 201602 Leases Topic 842 and subsequent amendments to the initial guidance ASU 201713 ASU 201810 ASU 201811 ASU 201820 and ASU 201901 collectively Topic 842 Topic 842 requires companies to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse ROU assets We adopted this new standard using the effective date of June 1 2019 as our initial application date Consequently financial information for the comparative periods was not updated We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance of the new standard which allows us to carry forward our historical lease classification The adoption of Topic 842 did not result in a cumulative catchup adjustment to the opening of our accumulated deficit balance as of June 1 2019 There was no material impact to our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended May 31 2020 due to the adoption of Topic 842 Refer to the Leases section below for a description of our accounting policy that we have applied since our adoption of Topic 842 Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon 74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2020 information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent that there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include cloud and license revenues which include the sale of cloud services and license support and cloud licenses and onpremise licenses which typically represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and onpremise IT environments hardware revenues which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems servers and storage products and industryspecific hardware and hardware support revenues and services revenues which are earned from providing cloud license and hardwarerelated services including consulting advanced customer services and education services License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and onpremise licenses purchased by our customers at their option License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and onpremise license fees Substantially all of our customers elect to renew their license support contracts annually Cloud services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud Services offerings which deliver applications and infrastructure technologies via cloudbased deployment models that we develop functionality for provide unspecified updates and enhancements for host manage upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period Our IaaS offerings also include Oracle Managed Cloud Services which are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management maintenance and security services for customer cloudbased onpremise or other IT infrastructure for a fee for a stated term Cloud license and onpremise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database middleware application and industryspecific software products which our customers use for cloudbased onpremise and other IT environments The vast majority of our cloud license and onpremise license arrangements include license support contracts which are entered into at the customers option Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems computer servers storage and industryspecific hardware Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees Our services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to among others deploy architect integrate upgrade and secure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2020 technologies Our advanced customer services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services We offer these advanced customer services to Oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of Oracle products and services Education services include instructorled mediabased and internetbased training in the use of our cloud software and hardware products We apply the provisions of ASC 606 Revenue From Contracts with Customers ASC 606 as a single standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of our cloud license hardware and services arrangements and generally requires revenues to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services provided to our customers reflecting the amount of consideration we expect to receive for those goods or services Pursuant to ASC 606 revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps identification of the contract or contracts with a customer identification of the performance obligations in the contract determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognition of revenues when or as the contractual performance obligations are satisfied Our customers that we contract with for the provision of cloud services software hardware or other services include businesses of many sizes government agencies educational institutions and our channel partners which include resellers and system integrators The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers We record an unbilled receivable which is included within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets when revenues are recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary Invoices for cloud license and onpremise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance Cloud SaaS and IaaS contracts are generally invoiced annually quarterly or monthly in advance Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division The transaction price for a contract that is financed through our Oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of nonoperating income net within our consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed Our revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant Our arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services Revenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the services are delivered beginning on the date our service is made available to our customers We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period Revenues from cloud services that are provided on a consumption basis such as metered services are generally recognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2020 Revenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support Oracles primary performance obligations with respect to license support contracts and hardware support contracts are to provide customers with technical support as needed and unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period if and when they are available Oracle is obligated to make the license and hardware support services available continuously throughout the contract period Therefore r evenues for license support contracts and hardware support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods that the support services are provided Revenue Recognition for Cloud License and OnPremise License Revenues from distinct cloud license and onpremise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use Revenues from usagebased royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and onpremise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs For usagebased royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer Revenue Recognition for Hardware Products The hardware product and related software such as an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer Revenue Recognition for Services Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed Revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion Revenues for consumptionbased services are generally recognized as the services are performed Allocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency therefore our products and services are generally not combined We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price SSP for each performance obligation within each contract We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and onpremise licenses we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change Our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and onpremise license purchase License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts that is the selling price is highly variable and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence As a result the SSP for a cloud license and an onpremise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance 77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2020 obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and onpremise license revenues Remaining Performance Obligations from Customer Contracts Trade receivables net of allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31 2020 and 2019 The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31 2020 and 2019 respectively that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31 2019 and 2018 respectively was approximately 84 billion and 83 billion respectively Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31 2020 2019 and 2018 Remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized and include deferred revenues invoices that have been issued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors In each fiscal year the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time and combined with foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other factors influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time As of May 31 2020 our remaining performance obligations were 370 billion approximately 62 of which we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter Sales of Financing Receivables We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products hardware products and services offerings through separate longterm payment contracts We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a nonrecourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables During fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 15 billion 18 billion and 17 billion respectively of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 in accounting for our acquisitions ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets or to an acquisition of a business A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of a business acquisitions measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2020 subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations ASC 420 and are accounted for separately from the business combination A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred Prior to June 1 2019 we accounted for operating lease abandonment pursuant to the provisions of ASC 420 Effective June 1 2019 abandoned operating leases related to an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as ROU asset impairment charges pursuant to Topic 842 and are accounted for separately from the business combination In all periods presented when estimating the asset impairment charges assumptions were applied regarding estimated sublease payments to be received which can differ from actual results This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made For a given business acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a nonincome tax related preacquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the business acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Marketable and NonMarketable Securities In accordance with ASC 320 InvestmentsDebt and Equity Securities and based on our intentions regarding these instruments we classify substantially all of our marketable debt securities as availableforsale We carry these securities at fair value and report the unrealized gains and losses net of taxes as a component of stockholders equity except for unrealized losses determined to be otherthantemporary which we record within nonoperating income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required Substantially all of our marketable debt investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations Investments in equity securities other than any equity method investments are recorded at fair value if fair value is readily determinable We hold investments in certain nonmarketable equity securities with no readily determinable fair values in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence We measure these equity securities at cost less any impairment adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer Our nonmarketable equity securities are included in other noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are subject to periodic impairment reviews 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2020 Fair Values of Financial Instruments We apply the provisions of ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4 Allowances for Doubtful Accounts We record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices For those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current economic trends We writeoff a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and trade receivables Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investmentgrade securities Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty creditrelated losses in these contracts is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of these contracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2020 2019 or 2018 We outsource the manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the US Further we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of thirdparty manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these thirdparty manufacturers build our hardware products Any inability of these thirdparty manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our hardware business Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons generally six to nine months Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware expenses In addition we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete At the point of loss recognition a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled 211 million and 320 million at May 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements

our products and services to third parties Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled 778 million and 776 million at May 31 2020 and 2019 respectively Deferred Sales Commissions We defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud license support and hardware support contract Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over a period of benefit that we estimate to be four to five years We determine the period of benefit by taking into consideration the historical and expected durations of our customer contracts the expected useful lives of our technologies and other factors Sales commissions for renewal contracts relating to our cloudbased arrangements are generally deferred and then amortized on a straightline basis over the related contractual renewal period which is generally one to three years Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations Property Plant and Equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value net of accumulated depreciation Depreciation is computed using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives of the assets which range from one to 40 years Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms as appropriate Property plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2020 2019 or 2018 Goodwill Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives which generally range from one to 10 years Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable When goodwill is assessed for impairment we have the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment optional assessment prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test Should the optional assessment be used for any given fiscal year qualitative factors to consider for a reporting unit include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerations macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit If we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed Otherwise no further testing is required For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis the discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis future economic and market conditions and market comparables of peer companies among others If as per the quantitative test the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit impairment is recognized for the difference limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting 81 Table of Contents Index to

result in a goodwill impairment charge W e did not recognize impairment charge s in fiscal 201 9 or 201 8 Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value If the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2020 2019 or 2018 At least annually we assess the useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets and may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a shorter amortization period is more reflective of the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows Derivative Financial Instruments During fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 we used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks see Note 10 below for additional information We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of each reporting date ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met ie the instruments are accounted for as hedges The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding earnings offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge each reporting period we record the change in fair value of the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCL in our consolidated balance sheets and the change is reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings Leases As referenced above our accounting policy for leases under ASC 842 was prospectively effective for us as of June 1 2019 We determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments because the implicit rate of the lease is generally not known Right of Use ROU assets related to our operating lease liabilities are measured at lease inception based on the initial measurement of the lease liability plus any prepaid lease payments and less any lease incentives Our lease terms that are used in determining our operating lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options We amortize our ROU assets as operating lease expense generally on a straightline basis over the lease term and classify both the lease amortization and imputed interest as operating expenses We have lease agreements with lease and nonlease components and in such cases we generally account for the components as a single lease component We do not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for any lease with an original lease term of less than one year ROU assets related to our operating leases are included in other noncurrent assets shortterm operating lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and longterm operating lease liabilities are included in other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets Cash flow movements related to our lease activities are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities as presented in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended May 31 2020 82 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

financial exposure Descriptions of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination are provided under Business Combinations above For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated Note 17 below provides additional information regarding certain of our legal contingencies Shipping and Handling Costs Our shipping and handling costs for hardware products sales are included in hardware expenses for all periods presented Foreign Currency We transact business in various foreign currencies In general the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local countrys currency Consequently revenues and expenses of operations outside the US are translated into US Dollars using weightedaverage exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the US are translated into US Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet dates The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in stockholders equity as a component of AOCL in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in nonoperating income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were 185 million 111 million and 74 million

Stock Compensation which requires that sharebased payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values We account for forfeitures of stockbased awards as they occur For our servicebased stock awards we recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the service period of the award which is generally four years For our PSUs and PSOs we recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the longer of the derived explicit or implicit service period which is the period of time expected for the performance condition to be satisfied During our interim and annual reporting periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods may cause the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of shares that are expected to vest are reflected in the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU or PSO tranche on a cumulative catch up basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered Changes in estimates of the implicit service periods are recognized prospectively We record deferred tax assets for stockbased compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized in each reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination 83 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2020

ASC 740 Income Taxes ASC 740 Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized A twostep approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax

perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820 ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value An assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities or Level 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Our assets and

revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially represent customer payments made in advance for cloud or support contracts that are typically billed in advance with corresponding revenues generally being recognized ratably over the contractual periods Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed Deferred cloud license and onpremise license revenues typically resulted from customer payments that related to undelivered products and services or specified enhancements In connection with our acquisitions we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support performance obligations assumed from our acquired companies We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost buildup approach The cost buildup approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin The sum of the costs and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations These aforementioned fair value adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud services and license support deferred revenues balances that we recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired obligations during the postcombination periods Refer to Note 15 for additional information 10 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair Value Hedges Interest Rate Swap Agreements and CrossCurrency Interest Rate Swap Agreements In May 2018 we entered into certain crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixedrate Euro denominated 2025 Notes including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to variablerate US Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR In July 2014 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixedinterest obligations associated with our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes that the swap agreements pertain to including the notional amounts and maturity dates We have designated the aforementioned swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815 The changes in fair values of the crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements associated with our July 2025 Notes are recognized as interest expense and nonoperating income net in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in noncurrent assets or noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 94 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2020 The changes in fair values of our interest rate swap agreements associated with our July 2021 Notes are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other noncurrent assets or other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets The amount of net gain loss attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense and amount of net gain loss attributable to the foreign exchange risk being hedged as applicable is recognized as nonoperating income net in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable current or notes payable noncurrent We exclude the portion of the change in fair value of crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the related crosscurrency basis spread in our assessment of hedge effectiveness The change in fair value of these crosscurrency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the crosscurrency basis spread is included in AOCL The periodic interest settlements for the swap agreements for the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities and for the swap agreements associated with the July 2025 Notes the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities Cash Flow Hedges CrossCurrency Swap Agreements In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes we entered into certain crosscurrency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixedrate Eurodenominated January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity to fixedrate US Dollardenominated debt The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows in US Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at 16 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 353 We have designated these crosscurrency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815 The critical terms of the crosscurrency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments being hedged and the crosscurrency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes We used the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of our crosscurrency swap agreements The fair values of these crosscurrency swap agreements are recognized as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets We reflect the gains or losses on the effective portion of these crosscurrency swap agreements in AOCL in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of AOCL into nonoperating income net in the same period that the carrying values of the Eurodenominated January 2021 Notes are remeasured and the interest expense is recognized The cash flows related to the crosscurrency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors 95 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2020 We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815 Accordingly we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contrac ts is nonoperating income net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses As of May 31 2020 and 2019 the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 42 billion and 38 billion respectively and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell US Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were 39 billion and 33 billion respectively The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31 2020 and 2019 The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities The effects of derivative instruments designated as hedges on certain of our consolidated financial statements were as follows as of or for each of the respective periods presented below amounts presented exclude any income tax effects Fair Values of

obligations with our suppliers which are agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the payment We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture subassemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished hardware products We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon leadtimes andor commercially standard leadtimes for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts disclosed below Routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way As of May 31 2020 our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows in millions Fiscal 2021 881 Fiscal 2022 66 Fiscal 2023 30 Fiscal 2024 27 Fiscal

of Directors certifies that performance has been achieved The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years in comparison to the typical ten year contractual lives for SOs For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense is to be recognized once each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service Stockbased compensation associated with a vesting tranche where vesting is no longer determined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the period when such a determination is made We have preliminarily estimated service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement to be up to five years Stockbased compensation for the marketbased tranche will be recognized using the derived service period for the marketbased metric achievement which we have initially estimated to be approximately three years In fiscal 1993 the Board adopted the 1993 Directors Stock Plan the Directors Plan which provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stockbased awards including nonqualified stock options to nonemployee directors The Directors Plan has from time to time been amended and restated Under the terms of the Directors Plan 10 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares In prior years we granted stock options at not less than fair market value that vest over four years and expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant We currently grant RSUs only that vest fully on the oneyear anniversary of the date of grant The Directors Plan was most recently amended on April 29 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards if any to each nonemployee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis as well as automatic grants for chairing certain Board committees subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors Plan In April 2020 the Compensation Committee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic RSU grants to each nonemployee director from 400000 to 350000 and eliminated all equity grants for chairing board committees As of May 31 2020 approximately 81000 unvested RSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 1 million shares of common stock all of which were vested were outstanding under the Directors Plan As of May 31 2020 approximately 1 million shares were available for future stock awards under this plan In connection with certain of our acquisitions we assumed certain outstanding restricted stockbased awards and stock options under each acquired companys respective stock plans or we substituted substantially similar awards under the

of foreign subsidiaries as they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the US At May 31 2020 the amount of temporary differences related to other outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which US income taxes have not been provided was approximately 79 billion If the other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction At May 31 2020 assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately 15 billion Our net deferred tax assets were 32 billion and 24 billion as of May 31 2020 and 2019 respectively We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income

reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period as defined above whichever comes first At May 31 2020 we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 597 million which are subject to limitation on their utilization Approximately 537 million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038 Approximately 60 million of these federal net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 20 billion at May 31 2020 which expire between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038 and are subject to limitations on their utilization We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 19 billion at May 31 2020 which are subject to limitations on their utilization Approximately 17 billion of these foreign net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates The remainder of the foreign net operating losses approximately 133 million expire between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2040 We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately 11 billion at May 31 2020 which are subject to limitations on their utilization Approximately 741 million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards approximately 357 million expire in various years between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038 We classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance

million 312 million and 127 million during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31 2020 and 2019 were 14 billion and 13 billion respectively Domestically US federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2017 Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process the most significant of which include the deductibility of certain royalty payments transfer pricing extraterritorial income exemptions domestic production activity foreign tax credits and research and development credits taken With all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate we believe that it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2020 the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months by as much as 11 billion 10 billion net of offsetting tax benefits Our US federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods Our US state income tax returns with 108 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2020 some exceptions have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods Internationally tax authorities for numerous nonUS jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits We believe that it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2020 the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both by as much as 105 million 42 million net of offsetting tax benefits in the next 12 months related primarily to transfer pricing With some exceptions we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in nonUS jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001 We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits However there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof On June 22 2020 the US Supreme Court declined a Writ of Certiorari in the case of Altera Corp vs Commissioner challenging a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which itself reversed a previous decision of the US Tax Court holding that the US Treasury Departments regulations requiring the inclusion of stockbased compensation expense in a taxpayers costsharing calculations were valid Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared consistent with this outcome and accordingly no adjustments will be required as the result of this development We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries including in particular Australia Brazil Canada India Indonesia Israel South Korea Mexico Pakistan Saudi Arabia and Spain where the amounts under controversy are significant In some although not all cases we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary If our estimates of the federal state and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment it could result in a further charge to expense 109 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued May 31 2020 15 SEGMENT INFORMATION ASC 280 Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker or decisionmaking group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance Our chief operating decision makers CODMs are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer We are organized by line of business and geographically While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed The tabular information below presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the companys performance and allocating company resources We have three businessescloud and license hardware and serviceseach of which is comprised of a single operating segment All three of our businesses market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes government agencies educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs Our cloud and license business engages in the sale marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and onpremise deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings and our cloud license and onpremise license offerings Cloud services and license support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly billed to customers in advance delivered to customers over time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms Cloud services and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available and for which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual term Cloud license and onpremise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses generally on a perpetual basis to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and onpremise IT environments We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to the customer to download and use which typically is immediate upon signature of the license contract In each fiscal year our cloud and license business contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter ie in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year as we receive payments from these contracts Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage industryspecific hardware operating systems virtualization management and other hardwarerelated software to support diverse IT environments Our hardware business also offers hardware support which provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of their hardware products such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software and can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Our services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies We do not track our assets for each business Consequently it is not practical to show assets by

On June 15 2011 HewlettPackard Company now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company HP filed a complaint in the California Superior Court County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing defamation intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HPs Itaniumbased servers it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20 2010 the HP Settlement Agreement resolving litigation between HP and one of Oracles former CEOs who had previously acted as HPs chief executive officer and chairman of HPs board of directors HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties rights and obligations under the HP Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief Oracle answered the complaint and filed crossclaims After a bench trial on the meaning of the HP Settlement Agreement the court found that the HP Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HPs Itaniumbased servers at no cost to HP The case proceeded to a jury trial in May 2016 On June 30 2016 the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on its crossclaims The jury awarded HP 30 billion in damages Under the courts rulings HP is entitled to postjudgment interest but not prejudgment interest on this award After the trial court denied Oracles motion for a new trial Oracle filed a notice of appeal on January 17 2017 On February 2 2017 HP filed a notice of appeal of the trial courts denial of prejudgment interest Oracle has posted a mandated surety bond with the trial court for the amounts owing No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations We continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HPs claims and we intend to present these defenses to the appellate court Oracle filed its opening brief on March 7 2019 Briefing on the appeal was completed November 1 2019 and the appellate court has not scheduled a date for oral argument We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process and the nature of the claims Litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome of the appeal process related to this action is uncertain It is possible that the resolution of this action could have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracles NetSuite Acquisition On May 3 and July 18 2017 two alleged stockholders filed separate derivative lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware purportedly on Oracles behalf Thereafter the court consolidated the two derivative cases and designated the July 18 2017 complaint as the operative complaint The consolidated lawsuit was brought against all the thencurrent members and one former member of our Board of Directors and Oracle as a nominal defendant Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc NetSuite at an excessive price Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief unspecified monetary damages including interest and attorneys fees and costs The
