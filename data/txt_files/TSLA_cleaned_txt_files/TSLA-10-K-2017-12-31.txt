50 kVa at 480V inverters that can be grouped together to form MWh and GWh sized installations The Powerpack 2 system can be used by commercial and industrial customers for peak shaving load shifting selfconsumption of solar generation and demand response as well as to provide backup power during grid outages and by utilities and independent power producers to smooth and firm the output of renewable power generation sources provide dynamic energy capacity to the grid defer or eliminate the need to upgrade transmission infrastructure and provide a variety of other grid services such as frequency regulation and voltage control Powerpack 2 can also be combined with renewable energy generation sources to create microgrids that provide remote communities with clean resilient and affordable power Along with designing and manufacturing energy storage products we continue to develop and advance our software capabilities for the control and optimal dispatch of energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications Solar Energy Systems The major components of our solar energy systems include solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical current inverters that convert the electrical output from the panels to a usable current compatible with the electric grid racking that attaches the solar panels to the roof or ground electrical hardware that connects the solar energy system to the electric grid and our monitoring device While we have recently started manufacturing solar panels in Gigafactory 2 in collaboration with Panasonic we currently purchase the majority of system components from vendors maintaining multiple sources for each major component to ensure competitive pricing and an adequate supply of materials We also design and manufacture other system components Sales of residential solar systems enable our customers to take direct advantage of federal tax credits to reduce their electricity costs Our solar loan offering enables customers to own their solar system with little upfront cost We also continue to offer lease and power purchase agreement options to both residential and commercial customers Our current standard leases and PPAs have a 20year term and we typically offer customers the opportunity to renew our agreements In October 2016 we unveiled Solar Roof which integrates solar energy production with aesthetically pleasing and durable glass roofing tiles and is designed to complement the architecture of homes and commercial buildings while turning sunlight into electricity We recently commenced Solar Roof production at our Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo New York and are beginning to install them in customers homes Technology Vehicles Our core competencies are powertrain engineering

with respect to battery cell chemistry and form factor We maintain extensive testing and RD capabilities at the individual cell level the full batterypack level and other critical battery pack systems and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithiumion cell vendors chemistry types and performance characteristics We believe that the flexibility of our designs combined with our research and realworld performance data will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells and optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles Power Electronics The power electronics in our electric vehicle powertrain govern the flow of high voltage electrical current throughout our vehicles and serve to power our electric motor to generate torque while driving and deliver energy into the battery pack while charging The drive inverter converts direct current DC from the battery pack into alternating current AC to drive our induction motors and provides regenerative braking functionality which captures energy from the wheels to charge the battery pack The primary technological advantages to our designs include the ability to drive large amounts of current in a small physical package The charger charges the battery pack by converting alternating current usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source into direct current that can be accepted by the battery Tesla vehicles can recharge on a wide variety of electricity sources due to the design of this charger from a common household outlet to high power circuits meant for more industrial uses Dual Motor Powertrain We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles which use two electric motors to provide greater efficiency performance and range in an allwheel drive configuration Teslas dual motor powertrain digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels The almost instantaneous response of the motors combined with low centers of gravity provides drivers with controlled performance and increased traction control Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software There are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions and we write custom firmware for many of these processors Software algorithms control traction vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle and are also used extensively to monitor the charge state of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems Drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance customize vehicle behavior manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions We develop almost all of this software including most of the user interfaces internally SelfDriving Development We have expertise in vehicle autopilot systems including autosteering traffic aware cruise control automated lane changing automated parking Summon and driver warning systems In October 2016 we began equipping all Tesla vehicles with hardware needed for full selfdriving capability including cameras that provide 360 degree visibility updated ultrasonic sensors for object detection a forwardfacing radar with enhanced processing and a powerful new onboard computer Our autopilot systems relieve our drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel Although at present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle our system provides safety and convenience functionality that allows our customers to rely on it much like the system that airplane pilots use when conditions permit This hardware suite along with overtheair firmware updates and field data feedback loops from the onboard camera radar ultrasonics and GPS enables the system to continually learn and improve its performance 4 Additionally we continue to make significant advancements in the development of fully selfdriving technologies Energy Storage We are leveraging many of the component level technologies from our vehicles to advance our energy storage products

1 Gigafactory 1 is being built in phases Tesla Panasonic and other partners are currently manufacturing inside the finished sections Our present plan is to continue expanding Gigafactory 1 over the next few years so that its capacity significantly exceeds the approximately 500000 vehicle per year capacity that we announced when we first started developing it and to additionally have sufficient capacity for our energy storage products We believe that Gigafactory 1 will allow us to achieve a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs once we are in volume production with Model 3 We have committed to substantial capital expenditures for Gigafactory 1 Panasonic has agreed to partner with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply us with battery cells Through our ownership of Gigafactory 1 and our partnership with Panasonic we own sole access to a facility designed to be the highestvolume and lowestcost source of lithiumion batteries in the world Supply Chain Our vehicles use thousands of purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of suppliers We have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts While we obtain components from multiple sources in some cases similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source In addition while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available we have currently fully qualified only one cell supplier for the battery packs we use in our production vehicles We are working to fully qualify additional cells from other manufacturers We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel cobalt lithium nickel and copper The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials We believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements Energy Storage Our energy storage products are manufactured at Gigafactory 1 We leverage the same supply chain process and infrastructure as we use for our vehicles The battery architecture and many of the components used in our energy storage products are the same or similar to those used in our vehicles battery pack enabling us to take advantage of manufacturing efficiencies and supply chain economies of scale The power electronics and inverters for the Powerwall and Powerpack systems are also manufactured at Gigafactory 1 allowing us to ship deploymentready systems directly to customers Solar Energy Systems We currently purchase major components such as solar panels and inverters directly from multiple manufacturers We typically purchase solar panels and inverters on an asneeded basis from our suppliers at thenprevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued under our master contractual arrangements In December 2016 we entered into a longterm agreement with Panasonic to manufacture photovoltaic PV cells and modules at our Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo New York with negotiated pricing provisions and the intent to manufacture at least 10 gigawatt of solar panels annually We have recently started manufacturing solar panels in Gigafactory 2 in collaboration with Panasonic 9 Governmental Programs Incentives and Regulations Vehicles California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives We have entered into multiple agreements over the past few years with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority CAEATFA that

tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits These incentives are available for the applicable periods ending on June 30 2034 subject to capital investments by Tesla and its partners for Gigafactory 1 of at least 350 billion in the aggregate on or before June 30 2024 which were met as of December 31 2017 and certain other conditions specified in the agreements If we do not satisfy one or more conditions under the agreements Tesla will be required to repay to the respective taxing authorities the amounts of the tax incentives incurred plus interest Tesla Regulatory Credits In connection with the production delivery and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles charging infrastructure and solar systems in global markets we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits We have sold these credits and will continue to sell future credits to automotive companies and regulated entities For example under Californias ZeroEmission Vehicle Regulation and those of states that have adopted Californias standard vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements These laws provide that automakers may bank excess credits referred to as ZEV credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws Manufacturers with a surplus of credits may sell their credits to other regulated parties Pursuant to the US Environmental Protection Agencys EPA national greenhouse gas GHG emission standards and similar standards adopted by the Canadian government car and truck manufacturers are required to meet fleetwide average carbon dioxide emissions standards Manufacturers may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who can use the credits to comply with these regulatory requirements Many US states have also adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production These requirements enable companies deploying solar energy to earn tradable credits known as Solar Renewable Energy Certificates SRECs RegulationVehicle Safety and Testing Our vehicles are subject to and comply with or are otherwise exempt from numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA including all applicable United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards FMVSS Our vehicles fully comply with all applicable FMVSSs without the need for any exemptions and we expect future Tesla vehicles to either fully comply or comply with limited exemptions related to new technologies Additionally there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSS and while we anticipate compliance there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted As a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS as well as the NHTSA bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the US Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness requirements crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA including the CAFE standards Theft Prevention Act requirements consumer information labeling requirements Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owners manual requirements The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturers suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing In addition this 10 law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings as determined by EPA as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA if such tests are conducted Our vehicles sold outside of the US are subject to foreign safety testing regulations Many of those regulations are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the US and may require redesign andor retesting The European Union has proposed new rules that if approved may significantly change the manner that vehicles are certified for compliance in Europe by creating more individual countrybycountry typeapproval requirements instead of the current singular Europewide system Regulation Self Driving There are no federal US regulations pertaining to the safety of selfdriving vehicles however NHTSA has established recommended guidelines Certain US states have legal restrictions on selfdriving vehicles and many other states are considering them This patchwork increases legal complexity for our vehicles In Europe certain vehicle safety regulations apply to selfdriving braking and steering systems and certain treaties also restrict the legality of certain higher levels of selfdriving vehicles Selfdriving laws and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the US and foreign countries and may create restrictions on our selfdriving features RegulationBattery Safety and Testing Our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of dangerous goods defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation such as by ocean vessel rail truck or air We have completed the applicable transportation tests for our battery packs demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulations We use lithiumion cells in our high voltage battery packs The cells do not contain any lead mercury cadmium or heavy metals Our battery packs include certain materials that contain trace amounts of hazardous chemicals whose use storage and disposal is regulated under federal law We currently have an agreement with a third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery packs Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation State laws regulate the manufacture distribution and sale of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state As we open additional Tesla stores and service centers we secure dealer licenses or their equivalent and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers A few states such as Michigan and Connecticut do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or otherwise restrict a manufacturers ability to deliver or service vehicles To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we generally conduct the sale out of the state via the internet phone or mail In such states we have opened galleries that serve an educational purpose and are not retail locations As we expand our retail footprint in the US some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations We expect that the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business model In addition we expect the dealer associations to actively lobby state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to Teslas ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations and we intend to actively fight any such efforts to limit our ability to sell our own vehicles While we have analyzed the principal laws in the US EU China Japan UK and Australia relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws we have not performed a complete analysis of all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles Accordingly there may be laws in certain jurisdictions that may restrict our sales and service operations 11 Energy Storage The regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development Nevertheless there are various policies incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal state and local level that support the adoption of energy storage For example energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the 30 tax credit under Section 48a3 of the Internal Revenue Code or the IRC as described below In addition California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage and behind the meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets In 2011 and 2013 FERC removed many barriers for systems like energy storage to provide frequency regulation service thus increasing the value these systems can obtain in wholesale energy markets More recently in late 2016 FERC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that if it becomes a final rule would further break down barriers preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy markets Finally in January 2017 FERC issued a statement supporting the use of energy storage as both electric transmission and as electric generation concurrently thus enabling energy storage systems to provide greater value to the electric grid Solar Energy Systems Government and Utility Programs and Incentives US federal state and local governments have established various policies incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy These incentives include tax credits cash grants tax abatements and rebates The federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit or Federal ITC under two sections of the IRC Section 48 and Section 25D Section 48a3 of the IRC allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30 of qualified expenditures for a commercial solar energy system that commences construction by December 31 2019 The credit then declines to 26 in 2020 22 in 2021 and a permanent 10 thereafter We claim the Section 48 commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial projects based on ownership of the solar energy system The federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible commercial solar energy systems Section 25D of the IRC allows a homeownertaxpayer to claim a credit of 30 of qualified expenditures for a residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by December 31 2019 The credit then declines to 26 in 2020 and 22 in 2021 and is scheduled to expire thereafter Customers who purchase their solar energy systems for cash or through our solar loan are eligible to claim the Section 25D investment tax credit In addition to the Federal ITC many US states offer personal and corporate tax credits and incentive available for solar energy systems Regulation General We are not a regulated utility in the US To operate our systems we obtain interconnection agreements from the utilities In almost all cases interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been preapproved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body Sales of electricity and nonsale equipment leases by third parties such as our leases and PPAs face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions Regulation Net Metering Thirtyeight states Washington DC and Puerto Rico have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering or net metering available to solar customers Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their onsite solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid Each of the states where we currently serve customers has adopted a net metering policy except for Texas where certain individual utilities have adopted net metering or a policy similar to net metering In certain jurisdictions regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so 12 Regulation Mandated Renewable Capacity Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production such as an enforceable renewable portfolio standard or RPS or other policies that require covered entities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources such as solar energy systems In solar renewable energy certificate or SREC state markets the RPS requires electricity suppliers to secure a portion of their electricity from solar generators The SREC program provides a means for SRECs to be created A SREC represents the renewable energy associated with 1000 kWhs of electricity produced from a solar energy system When a solar energy system generates 1000 kWhs of electricity one SREC is issued by a government agency which can then be sold separately from the energy produced to covered entities who surrender the SRECs to the state to prove compliance with the states renewable energy mandate Competition Vehicles The worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more so in the future as we introduce additional vehicles including Model 3 which will compete with lowerpriced vehicles We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology For example Model S and Model X compete primarily in the extremely competitive premium sedan and premium SUV markets with internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers and Model 3 competes with small to mediumsized sedans Our vehicles also compete with vehicles propelled by alternative fuels principally electricity Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market Overall we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicles particularly those fueled by electricity relative to the internal combustion vehicle Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles Electric vehicles have also already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the US market as well In addition several manufacturers sell hybrid vehicles including plugin versions of their hybrid vehicles Energy Storage The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive Established companies such as AES Energy Storage Siemens LG Chem and Samsung as well as various emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio There are several companies providing individual components of energy storage systems such as cells battery modules and power electronics as well as others providing integrated systems We compete with these companies on price energy density and efficiency We believe that the specifications of our products our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our Powerpack 2 product give us a competitive advantage when marketing our products Solar Energy Systems The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems while others only provide financing for these installations In the residential solar energy system installation market our primary competitors include Vivint Solar Inc Sunrun Inc Trinity Solar SunPower Corporation and many smaller local solar companies Intellectual Property As part of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights such as with respect to patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets including through employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and 13 other contractual arrangements Additionally we previously announced a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world Segment Information We operate as two reportable segments automotive and energy generation and storage The automotive segment includes the design development manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles The energy generation and storage segment includes the design manufacture installation and sale or lease of stationary energy storage products and solar energy systems and sale of electricity generated by our solar energy systems to customers Employees As of December 31 2017 Tesla Inc had 37543 fulltime employees To date we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good Available Information We file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto including our Annual Reports on Form 10K our Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q and Current Reports on Form 8K proxy

the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results Risks Related to Our Business and Industry We have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delays or other complications in the design manufacture launch and production ramp of new vehicles and other products such as Model 3 our energy storage products and the Solar Roof which could harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results We have previously experienced launch manufacturing and production ramp delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle models such as Model S Model X and Model 3 and new vehicle features such as the allwheel drive dual motor drivetrain on Model S and the second version of autopilot hardware For example we encountered unanticipated challenges such as certain supply chain constraints that led to initial delays in producing Model X Similarly we have experienced certain bottlenecks in the production of Model 3 in places like the battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1 leading to delays in its ramp If such issues continue longer than expected or new issues arise or recur with respect to Model 3 or any of our other production vehicles we could experience further delays In addition because our vehicle models share certain production facilities with other models the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact the production of other models We may also experience similar future delays or other complications in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicles such as our Tesla Semi truck our planned Model Y and new Tesla Roadster our energy storage products and the Solar Roof Any significant additional delay or other complication in the production of our current products or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future products including complications associated with expanding our production capacity and supply chain or obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results We may experience delays in realizing our projected timelines and cost and volume targets for the production and ramp of our Model 3 vehicle which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results Our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to manufacture market and sell the Model 3 vehicle which we are offering at a lower price point and which we intend to produce at significantly higher volumes than our present production capabilities for the Model S or Model X vehicles We commenced production and initial customer deliveries of Model 3 in July 2017 and are targeting a forecasted production rate of 5000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter of 2018 We have no experience to date in manufacturing vehicles at the high volumes that we anticipate for Model 3 and to be successful we will need to complete the implementation and ramp of efficient and costeffective manufacturing capabilities processes and supply chains necessary to support such volumes We are employing a higher degree of automation in our materials conveyance battery module production and other manufacturing processes for Model 3 than we have previously employed and in some cases we have implemented interim processes such as semiautomated manufacturing lines for which we are likely to incur additional labor costs until we bring online our fully automated processes Moreover our Model 3 production plan has generally required and will require significant investments of cash and management resources Our production plan for Model 3 is based on many key assumptions including that we will be able to complete ramping high volume production of Model 3 at the Tesla Factory without exceeding our projected costs and on our projected timeline that we will be able to continue to expand Gigafactory 1 in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithiumion cells to be integrated into battery modules and finished battery packs and drive unit components for Model 3 all at costs that allow us to sell Model 3 at our target gross margins 15 that the equipment and processes which we have selected for Model 3 production will be able to accurately manufacture high volumes of Model 3 vehicles within specified design tolerances and with high quality that we will be able to maintain suppliers for the necessary components on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us and that we will be able to obtain components on a timely basis and in the necessary quantities to support high volume production and that we will be able to attract recruit hire train and retain skilled employees including employees on the production line to operate our planned high volume production facilities to support Model 3 including at the Tesla Factory and Gigafactory 1 If one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect our ability to meet our Model 3 projections on time and at volumes and prices that are profitable the number of current and future Model 3 reservations as well as our business prospects operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted We may be unable to meet our growing vehicle production and delivery plans both of which could harm our business and prospects Our plans call for significant increases in vehicle production and deliveries to high volumes in a short amount of time Our ability to achieve these plans will depend upon a number of factors including our ability to utilize installed manufacturing capacity achieve the planned production yield and further increase capacity as planned while maintaining our desired quality levels and optimize design and production changes and our suppliers ability to support our needs In addition we have used and may use in the future a number of new manufacturing technologies techniques and processes for our vehicles which we must successfully introduce and scale for high volume production For example we have introduced highly automated production lines aluminum spot welding systems and highspeed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle parts We have also introduced unique design features in our vehicles with different manufacturing challenges such as large display screens dual motor drivetrain autopilot hardware and falconwing doors We have limited experience developing manufacturing selling and servicing and allocating our available resources among multiple products simultaneously If we are unable to realize our plans our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially damaged Concurrent with the significant planned increase in our vehicle production levels we will also need to continue to significantly increase deliveries of and servicing capacity for our vehicles Although we have a plan for delivering and servicing significantly increased volumes of vehicles we have limited experience in delivering a high volume of vehicles and no experience in delivering and servicing vehicles at the significantly higher volumes we anticipate for Model 3 and we may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans into both existing markets as well as new markets into which we expand If we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery and servicing needs globally this could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results We are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are single source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products according to our schedule and at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently manage these components could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results Our products contain numerous purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of direct suppliers the majority of whom are currently single source suppliers although we attempt to qualify and obtain components from multiple sources whenever feasible Any significant unanticipated demand would require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time and in the past we have also replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources of supply for most of our components in a relatively short time frame there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our products Moreover we have signed longterm agreements with Panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and supplier for lithiumion cells at Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and PV cells and panels at Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo New York If we encounter unexpected difficulties with key suppliers such as Panasonic 16 and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers we could experience production delays and potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing servicing and supporting our products This limited and in many cases single source supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for the production of our products such as those which we experienced in 2012 and 2016 in connection with our slowerthanplanned Model S and Model X ramps Furthermore unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing labor issues wars governmental changes natural disasters such as the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan and other factors beyond our and our suppliers control could also affect our suppliers ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to product design changes and delays in product deliveries to our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers and result in negative publicity damage to our brand and a material and adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results Changes in our supply chain have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost We have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to design changes that we made and we may experience similar cost increases in the future Certain suppliers have sought to renegotiate the terms of the supply arrangements Additionally we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer The foregoing discussion applies to Model 3 and our energy storage products as well However because we plan to produce Model 3 at significantly higher volumes than Model S or Model X the negative impact of any delays or other constraints with respect to our suppliers for Model 3 could be substantially greater than any such issues experienced with respect to our other products As some of our suppliers for Model S and Model X do not have the resources equipment or capability to provide components for the Model 3 in line with our requirements we have engaged a significant number of new suppliers and we need such suppliers to ramp and deliver according to our schedule There is no assurance that these suppliers will ultimately be able to meet our cost quality and volume needs or do so at the times needed Furthermore as the scale of our vehicle production increases we will need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facilities components at much higher volumes than we have experience with If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and writeoff costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles especially in the mass market demographic which we are targeting with Model 3 Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular Although we have successfully grown demand for Model S and Model X have seen very strong initial demand for Model 3 and believe that we will be able to continue to grow demand separately for each of these and future vehicles there is no guarantee of such future demand or that our vehicles will not compete with one another in the market Moreover the mass market demographic which we are targeting with Model 3 is larger but more competitive than the demographic for Model S and Model X and additional electric vehicles are entering the market If the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicles decreases in key and other markets our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be harmed The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new rapidly evolving and could be affected by numerous external factors such as p erceptions about electric vehicle features quality safety performance and cost perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge 17 competition including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles plugin hybrid electric vehicles and high fueleconomy internal combustion engine vehicles volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline government regulations and economic incentives and access to charging facilities Future problems or delays in expanding Gigafactory 1 or ramping operations there could negatively affect the production and profitability of our products such as Model 3 To lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume we have vertically integrated the production of lithiumion cells and finished battery packs for Model 3 and energy storage products at Gigafactory 1 While Gigafactory 1 began producing lithiumion cells for energy storage products in January 2017 and has since begun producing lithiumion cells for Model 3 we have no other direct experience in the production of lithiumion cells Given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in the cost of expanding and operating Gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and Gigafactory 1 taking longer to ramp production and expand than we currently anticipate In order to reach our planned volume and gross margin for Model 3 we must have significant cell production from Gigafactory 1 which among other things requires Panasonic to successfully ramp its allnew cell production lines to significant volumes over a short period of time Although Panasonic has a long track record of producing highquality cells at significant volume at its factories in Japan it has never before started and ramped cell production at a factory in the US like at Gigafactory 1 In addition we have started producing several components for Model 3 such as battery modules incorporating the lithiumion cells produced by Panasonic at Gigafactory 1 Some of the manufacturing lines for such components have taken longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity We expect that we will continue to experience challenges as we move through the ramp and we will continue to finetune our manufacturing lines to address them While we currently believe that we will reach our production targets if we are unable to resolve ramping challenges and expand Gigafactory 1 production in a timely manner and at reasonable prices and if we or Panasonic are unable to attract hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled personnel our ability to supply battery packs or other components for Model 3 and our other products could be negatively impacted Any such problems or delays with Gigafactory 1 could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected our ability to develop market and sell our products and services could be harmed If our vehicles or our energy products were to contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair or certain features of our vehicles such as full selfdriving take longer than expected to become enabled or are legally restricted our ability to develop market and sell our products and services could be harmed For example the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and could conceivably contain latent defects and errors or be subject to external attacks Issues experienced by customers have included those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12 volt battery in the Model S and the seats and doors in the Model X Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible such efforts may not be timely may hamper production or may not be up to the satisfaction of our customers While we have performed extensive internal testing on the products we manufacture we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed longterm quality reliability durability and performance characteristics of our battery packs powertrains vehicles and energy storage products There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for consumers Any product defects delays or legal restrictions on product features or other failure of our products to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays product recalls product liability claims significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects Model 3 has not yet been evaluated by NHTSA for a star rating under the New Car Assessment Program and while based on our internal evaluation we expect to obtain comparable ratings to those achieved by Model S and Model X there is no assurance this will occur 18 If we fail to scale our business operations and otherwise manage future growth and adapt to new conditions effectively as we rapidly grow our company including internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our products successfully Any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition We continue to expand our operations significantly including internationally including by a transition to high volume vehicle production with the ramp of Model 3 and the worldwide sales delivery and servicing of a significantly higher number of vehicles than our current vehicle fleet in the coming years Furthermore we are developing and growing our energy storage product and solar business worldwide including in countries where we have limited or no previous operating experience in connection with our vehicle business Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage our expansion and growth successfully We may not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to control expenses and avoid cost overruns and other unexpected operating costs establish sufficient worldwide automobile sales delivery service and Supercharger facilities in a timely manner adapt our products and conduct our operations to meet local requirements implement the required infrastructure systems and processes and find and hire a significant number of additional manufacturing engineering service electrical installation construction and administrative personnel If we are unable to achieve our targeted manufacturing costs for our vehicles including Model 3 our financial condition and operating results will suffer While we have experienced and expect in the future to realize cost reductions by both us and our suppliers there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals We incur significant costs related to procuring the materials required to manufacture our vehicles assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel We may also incur substantial costs or cost overruns in utilizing and increasing the production capability of our vehicle manufacturing facilities such as for Model 3 Furthermore if we are unable to achieve production cost targets on our vehicles pursuant to our plans we may not be able to meet our gross margin and other financial targets Many of the factors that impact our manufacturing costs are beyond our control such as potential increases in the costs of our materials and components such as lithium nickel and other components of our battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels If we are unable to continue to control and reduce our manufacturing costs our operating results business and prospects will be harmed We are significantly dependent upon revenue generated from the sale of a limited fleet of electric vehicles which currently includes Model S Model X and Model 3 We currently generate a significant percentage of our revenues from the sale of two products Model S and Model X vehicles Model 3 for which we are planning significantly higher volumes than Model S or Model X has required and will continue to require significant investment in connection with its ongoing ramp and there is no guarantee that it will be commercially successful Historically automobile customers have come to expect a variety of vehicles offered in a manufacturers fleet and new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently In order to meet these expectations we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models To the extent our product variety and cycles do not meet consumer expectations or cannot be produced on our projected timelines and cost and volume targets our future sales may be adversely affected This could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results Our vehicles and energy storage products make use of lithiumion battery cells which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such events have raised concerns and future events may lead to additional concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications The battery packs that we produce make use of lithiumion cells On rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells While we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cells release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur which could subject us to lawsuits product recalls or redesign efforts all of which would be time consuming and expensive Also negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithiumion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithiumion 19 cells such as a vehicle or other fire even if such incident does not involve our vehicles or energy storage products could seriously harm our business In addition we store a significant number of lithiumion cells at our facilities and plan to produce high volumes of cells and battery modules and packs at Gigafactory 1 Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations Such damage or injury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall Moreover any failure of a competitors electric vehicle or energy storage product may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products Such adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results Increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of materials in particular for lithiumion cells could harm our business We may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials Any such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results We use various materials in our business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper and cobalt as well as lithiumion cells from suppliers The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials including as a result of increased production of electric vehicles and energy storage products by our competitors and could adversely affect our business and operating results For instance we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithiumion cells These risks include an increase in the cost or decrease in the available supply of materials used in the cells disruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by battery cell manufacturers or any issues that may arise with respect to cells manufactured at our own facilities and fluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen against the US dollar as our battery cell purchases for Model S and Model X and some raw materials for cells used in Model 3 and energy storage products are currently denominated in Japanese yen Our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles and energy storage products While we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs and expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cells manufactured at our own facilities we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of suppliers for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers In particular we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cells used in battery packs for our current production vehicles Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such suppliers could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for energy products until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified Furthermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and material costs Substantial increases in the prices for our materials or prices charged to us such as those charged by battery cell suppliers would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices Any attempts to increase vehicle prices in response to increased material costs could result in cancellations of vehicle orders and reservations and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospects and operating results We may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims Although we design our vehicles to be the safest vehicles on the road product liability claims could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition The automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected As is true for other automakers our cars have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in crashes resulting in death or personal injury and such crashes where autopilot is engaged are the subject of significant public attention We have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims related to misuse or failures of new technologies that we are pioneering including autopilot in our vehicles Moreover as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity they have the potential to cause 20 injury to people or property A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of vehicles and energy storage products delivered to date and limited field experience of our products Moreover a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have material adverse effect on our brand business prospects and operating results In most jurisdictions we generally selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds not by insurance The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in these industries We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future including competition from companies with new technology The worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future There is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which they compete Many established and new automobile manufacturers such as Audi BMW Daimler General Motors Toyota and Volvo as well as other companies have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plugin hybrid and fully electric vehicles as well as the market for selfdriving technology and applications In some cases such competitors have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing vehicle sales networks and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products Increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales price reductions revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results In addition our Model 3 vehicle faces competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan market including Audi BMW Lexus and Mercedes The solar and energy storage industries are highly competitive We face competition from other manufacturers developers and installers of solar and energy storage systems as well as from large utilities Decreases in the retail prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults under our existing longterm leases and PPAs Moreover solar panel and lithiumion battery prices have declined and are continuing to decline As we increase our battery and solar manufacturing capabilities including at Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory 2 future price declines may harm our ability to produce energy storage systems and solar systems at competitive prices If we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our longterm business prospects among consumers analysts and within our industries then our financial condition operating results business prospects and stock price may suffer materially Consumers may be less likely to purchase our products now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and other operations will continue in the long term Similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed Accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customers suppliers analysts and other parties in our longterm financial viability and business prospects Maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors such as our limited operating history unfamiliarity with our products competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services and our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations Many of these factors are largely outside our control and any negative perceptions about our longterm business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed 21 Our plan to generate ongoing growth and demand including by expand ing our network of Tesla stores galleries delivery centers service centers and Superchargers will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet expectations with respect to additional sales or installations of our products or availability of Superchargers We plan to generate ongoing growth and demand including by globally expanding our network of Tesla stores galleries delivery centers service centers mobile service offerings and Superchargers These plans will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales or installations of our products This ongoing global expansion which includes planned entry into markets in which we have limited or no experience selling delivering installing andor servicing our products and which may pose legal regulatory labor cultural and political challenges that we have not previously encountered may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and installations and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating Furthermore the increasing number of Model S and Model X vehicles as well as the significant increase in our vehicle fleet size that we expect from Model 3 will require us to continue to increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors significantly If we fail to do so our customers could become dissatisfied which could adversely affect sales of our vehicles We will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale installation and service of our products the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy systems and operation of Superchargers in those jurisdictions which could take considerable time and expense If we experience any delays or cannot meet customer expectations in expanding our customer infrastructure network or our expansion plans are not successful in continuing to grow demand this could lead to a decrease or stagnation in sales or installations of our products and could negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results We face risks associated with our international operations and expansion including unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor conditions and with establishing ourselves in new markets all of which could harm our business We currently have international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions that are subject to legal political and regulatory requirements and social and economic conditions that may be very different from those affecting us domestically Additionally as part of our growth strategy we will continue to expand our sales delivery service and Supercharger locations internationally International expansion requires us to make significant expenditures including the establishment of local operating entities hiring of local employees and establishing facilities in advance of generating any revenue We are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention These risks include conforming our products to various international regulatory and safety requirements as well as charging and other electric infrastructures difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations challenges in attracting customers foreign government taxes regulations and permit requirements our ability to enforce our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange controls and preferences of foreign nations for domestically manufactured products If we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual financing and credit risks related to our vehicle financing programs our business may suffer We offer vehicle financing arrangements for Model S and Model X through our local subsidiaries in the US Canada Germany and the UK including leasing directly through certain of those subsidiaries The profitability of the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual values secure adequate financing andor business partners to fund and grow this program and screen for and manage customer credit risk We expect the need for leasing and other financing options will continue to be important to Model S and Model X deliveries and for Model 3 in the long term If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal funds or partners or other external financing sources and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers we may be unable to grow our sales Furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth Finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state andor local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties either of which may harm our business 22 The unavailability reduction or elimination of or unfavorable determinations with respect to government and economic incentives in the U S and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles or solar energy could have some impact on demand for our products and services We currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles In the US and abroad such incentives include among other things tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles In Norway for example the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes taxes on nonrecurring vehicle fees the 25 value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gaspowered vehicles Notably the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided to gaspowered vehicles through the oil and gas industries Nevertheless even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced eliminated or exhausted For example in April 2017 and January 2016 respectively previously available incentives in Hong Kong and Denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired negatively impacting sales Moreover under current regulations a 7500 federal tax credit available in the US for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles with at least 17 kWh of battery capacity such as our vehicles will begin to phase out over time with respect to any vehicles delivered in the second calendar quarter following the quarter in which we deliver our 200000 th qualifying vehicle in the US We currently expect such 200000 th qualifying delivery to occur at some point during 2018 In addition California implemented regulations phasing out a 2500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for highincome consumers which became effective in March 2016 In certain circumstances there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interests to bring about such developments which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles In addition certain governmental rebates tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our installation costs and cost of capital and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds However these incentives may expire on a particular date end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase often without warning For example the federal government currently offers a 30 investment tax credit ITC for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a cosited solar power facility The ITC is currently scheduled to decline to 10 and expire altogether for residential systems by January 2022 Likewise in jurisdictions where net energy metering is currently available our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use Several jurisdictions have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed to do so Such reductions in or termination of governmental incentives could adversely impact our results by making our products less competitive for potential customers increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets Additionally the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US could potentially increase the cost and decrease the availability of renewable energy financing by reducing the value of depreciation benefits associated with and the overall investor tax capacity needed to monetize renewable energy projects Such changes could lower the overall investment willingness and capacity for such projects available in the market Moreover we and our fund investors claim the ITC in amounts based on the fair market value of our solar and energy storage systems Although we obtain independent appraisals to support the claimed fair market values the relevant governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that they should be lower and they may do so in the future Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences andor our obligation to make indemnification or other payments or contribute additional assets to our funds or fund investors Any failure by us to realize the expected benefits of our substantial investments and commitments with respect to the manufacture of PV cells and modules including if we are unable to comply with the terms of our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York relating to our Gigafactory 2 could result in negative consequences for our business We own certain PV cell and module manufacturing and technology assets and a buildtosuit lease arrangement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York the SUNY Foundation This agreement with the SUNY Foundation provides for the construction of Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo New York which at full capacity we expect will be capable of producing at least 10 gigawatt of PV cells and modules annually including for our Solar Roof Under this agreement we are obligated to among other things employ specified 23 minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10year period following the completion of all construction and related infrastructure the arrival of manufacturing equipment and the receipt of certain permits and other specified items at Gigafactory 2 If we fail in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligations we would be obligated to pay a program payment of 412 million to the SUNY Foundation in such year Any inability on our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation the termination of our lease at Gigafactory 2 andor the need to secure an alternative supply of PV cells and modules for products such as our Solar Roof Moreover if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and technology assets in accordance with our expectations we may have to recognize accounting charges pertaining to the writeoff of such assets Any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results If we are unable to attract andor retain key employees and hire qualified personnel our ability to compete could be harmed The loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business prospects and operating results In particular we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer and Jeffrey B Straubel our Chief Technical Officer None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key technology sales marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results Key talent may leave Tesla due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience In California Nevada and other regions where we have operations there is increasing competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles software engineering manufacturing engineering and other skills such as electrical and building construction expertise This competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones Our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner especially to support our expansion plans and ramp to highvolume manufacture of vehicles and retain current employees Additionally we compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and startups and emerging companies that promise shortterm growth opportunities Difficulties in retaining current employees or recruiting new ones could have an adverse effect on our performance We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer Chairman of our Board of Directors and largest stockholder Although Mr Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla Mr Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and is involved in other emerging technology ventures On February 8 2018 we filed a proxy statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to which we are seeking stockholder approval of the grant in January 2018 of a 10year performancebased stock option award for Mr Musk which will be forfeited if not so approved the CEO Performance Award Mr Musk currently has no other compensation at Tesla other than a prior performancebased stock option award granted to Mr Musk in 2012 which has vested as to 9 out of 10 tranches and a statemandated minimum wage salary that he has never accepted There is no assurance that the CEO Performance Award will receive stockholder approval We are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities As a manufacturing company including with respect to facilities such as the Tesla Factory Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory 2 we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations at numerous 24 jurisdictional levels in the U S and abroad including laws relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials The costs of compliance including remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and any changes to our operations mandated by new or amended laws may be significant We may also face unexpected delays in obtaining permits and approvals required by such laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities which would hinder our operation of these facilities Such costs and delays may adversely impact our business prospects and operating results Furthermore any violations of these laws may result in substantial fines and penalties remediation costs third party damages or a suspension or cessation of our operations Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities It is common for employees at companies with significant manufacturing operations such as us to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages Moreover regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the US mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies operations Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory The United Automobile Workers has publicly announced a desire to organize the Tesla Factory and has been engaged in a campaign against the company Furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results If a work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results or financial condition Our products and services are subject to substantial regulations which are evolving and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results Motor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local laws We incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and may be required to incur additional costs to comply with any changes to such regulations and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses delays or fines We are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture import sale and service of automobiles internationally For example in countries outside of the US we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and emissions among other things that are often materially different from requirements in the US thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements Additionally our vehicles are equipped with a suite of driverassistance features called autopilot which help assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel but require drivers to remain engaged There is a variety of international federal and state regulations that may apply to selfdriving vehicles which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a driver Such regulations continue to rapidly change which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations or may delay products or restrict selfdriving features and availability any of which could adversely affect our business Moreover as a manufacturer and installer of solar generation and energy storage systems and a supplier of electricity generated and stored by the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers we are impacted by federal state and local regulations and policies concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by thirdparty owned systems For example existing or proposed regulations and policies would permit utilities to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customers with their solar energy systems charge fees and penalties to our customers relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid adjust electricity rate designs such that the price of our solar products may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid restrict us and our customers from transacting under our PPAs or qualifying for government incentives and benefits that apply to solar power and limit or eliminate net energy metering If such regulations and policies remain in effect or are adopted in other jurisdictions or if other regulations and policies that adversely impact the interconnection of our solar and energy storage systems to the grid are introduced modified or eliminated they could deter potential customers from 25 purchasing our solar and energy storage products threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions which could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations We are subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws Our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages and other costs We may also incur substantial expenses and costs in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws For example commencing in May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation the GDPR will fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union The GDPR will create new compliance obligations and will significantly increase fines for noncompliance Although we take steps to protect the security of our customers personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers personal information A major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences for our business and future prospects including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand We may be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other actions which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance Any product recall including for solar or charging equipment in the future may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition For example certain limited vehicle recalls that we initiated in the past two years have resulted from a component that could prevent the parking brake from releasing once engaged a concern with the firmware in the restraints control module in certain righthanddrive vehicles industrywide issues with airbags from a particular supplier a front seat belt issue in a single field vehicle and Model X seat components that could cause unintended seat movement during a collision Furthermore testing of our vehicles by government regulators or industry groups may require us to initiate vehicle recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our vehicles In the future we may at various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our products or our electric vehicle powertrain components that we have provided to other vehicle OEMs including any systems or parts sourced from our suppliers prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as federal motor vehicle safety standards Such recalls whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets as well as our business prospects financial condition and results of operations Our resale value guarantee and leasing programs for our vehicles expose us to the risk that the resale values of vehicles returned to us are lower than our estimates and may result in lower revenues gross margin profitability and liquidity We have provided resale value guarantees to many of our customers under which such customers may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at predetermined resale values If the resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than our estimates our profitability andor liquidity could be negatively impacted We have applied lease accounting on leases made directly by us and prior to 2018 on all leases made by our leasing partners and sales by us of vehicles with a resale value guarantee Under lease accounting we recognize the associated revenues and costs of the vehicle sale over time rather than fully upfront at vehicle delivery As a result these programs generate lower revenues in the period the car is delivered and higher gross margins during the period of the resale value guarantee as compared to purchases in which the resale value guarantee does not apply A higher than anticipated prevalence of these programs could therefore have an adverse impact on our near term revenues and operating results Moreover unlike the sale of a vehicle with a resale value guarantee or programs with leasing partners which do not impact our cash flows and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery under a lease held directly by us we may receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease To the extent we expand our leasing program without securing 26 external financing or business partners to support such expansion our cash flow and liquidity could also be negatively impacted Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance Subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system battery and drive unit we provide four year or 50000 mile limited warranties for the purchasers of new Model 3 Model S and Model X vehicles and either a four year or 50000 mile limited warranty or a two year or 100000 mile limited warranty for the purchasers of used Model S or Model X vehicles certified and sold by us The limited warranty for the battery and drive unit for new Model S and Model X vehicles covers the drive unit for eight years as well as the battery for a period of eight years or for certain older vehicles 125000 miles if reached sooner than eight years although the batterys charging capacity is not covered under any of our warranties or Extended Service plans the limited warranty for used Model S and Model X vehicles does not extend or otherwise alter the terms of the original battery and drive unit limited warranty for such used vehicles specified in their original New Vehicle Limited Warranty For the battery and drive unit on our current new Model 3 vehicles we offer an eight year or 100000 mile limited warranty for our standard range battery and an eight year or 120000 mile limited warranty for our long range battery with minimum 70 retention of battery capacity over the warranty period In addition customers of new Model S and Model X vehicles have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of the limited warranty for their new vehicles to cover additional services for up to an additional four years or 50000 miles provided it is purchased within a specified period of time For energy storage products we provide limited warranties against defects and to guarantee minimum energy retention levels For example we guarantee that each Powerwall 2 product will maintain at least 7080 of its stated energy capacity after 10 years and that each Powerpack 2 product will retain specified minimum energy capacities in each of its first 10 to 15 years of use For our Solar Roof we offer a warranty on the glass tiles for the lifetime of a customers home and a separate warranty for the energy generation capability of the solar tiles We also offer extended warranties availability guarantees and capacity guarantees for periods of up to 20 years at an additional cost at the time of purchase as well as workmanship warranties to customers who elect to have us install their systems Finally customers who buy energy from us under solar energy system leases or PPAs are covered by warranties equal to the length of the agreement term which is typically 20 years Systems purchased for cash are covered by a warranty of up to 10 years with extended warranties available at additional cost In addition we pass through to our customers the inverter and panel manufacturers warranties which generally range from 5 to 25 years subjecting us to the risk that the manufacturers may later cease operations or fail to honor their underlying warranties Finally we provide a performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that compensates a customer on an annual basis if their system does not meet the electricity production guarantees set forth in their lease If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected Warranty reserves include managements best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty These estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such as Model 3 and Solar Roof that are new andor that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future We are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems and use security measures designed to protect our systems against breaches and cyberattacks If these efforts are not successful our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results and reputation could be harmed We are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems including implementing new internally developed systems to assist us in the management of our business In particular our volume production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the US and abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management 27 financial tax and regulatory compliance systems The implementation maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost Moreover there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sales and service processes These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicles or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations We also maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against system security risks data breaches and cyberattacks We cannot be sure that these systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented maintained or expanded as planned If we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these systems as planned our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results Moreover our proprietary information could be compromised and our reputation may be adversely affected If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions Our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks We may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of God and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage As a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all Additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or selfinsured retentions and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results Our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to fluctuations in our operating costs We expect our periodtoperiod financial results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we among other things ramp up the production of Model 3 expand Gigafactory 1 open new Tesla stores and service centers with maintenance and repair capabilities open new Supercharger locations ramp production at Gigafactory 2 increase our sales and marketing activities and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations Moreover we expect to continue to design develop and manufacture new and future products and increase our production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities As a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results especially in the shortterm are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance Moreover our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors If any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicles systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our vehicles and harm our business Our vehicles contain complex information technology systems For example our vehicles are designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update the functionality of our vehicles We have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks our vehicles and their systems However hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such networks vehicles and systems to gain control of or to change our vehicles functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our vehicles via our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerabilities Accordingly we have received reports of potential vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted to remedy them However there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be identified in the future or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful 28 Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings In addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles their systems or data as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our vehicles their systems or data are capable of being hacked could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results We have been the subject of such reports in the past Servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness As of December 31 2017 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 1017 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see Note 13 Convertible and LongTerm Debt Obligations to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions We and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt Pursuant to their terms holders of our 150 Convertible Senior notes due 2018 025 Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 125 Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 and 2375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 collectively the Tesla Convertible Notes may convert their respective Tesla Convertible Notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the respective Tesla Convertible Notes under certain circumstances Upon conversion of the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes we will be obligated to deliver cash andor shares in respect of the principal amounts thereof and the conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on such Tesla Convertible Notes For example in June 2017 September 2017 and November 2017 pursuant to separate privately negotiated agreements we exchanged 1448 million 100 million and 120 million respectively in aggregate principal amount of the 150 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 for 12 million shares 01 million shares and 01 million shares respectively of our common stock Moreover our subsidiarys 275 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 1625 Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 and ZeroCoupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 collectively the Subsidiary Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at conversion prices ranging from 30000 to 75936 per share Finally holders of the Tesla Convertible Notes and the Subsidiary Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures If we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time In addition our ability to make payments may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all which could result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business The terms of certain of our credit facilities including our senior secured asset based revolving credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or make other restricted payments and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt In addition under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio As a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions including to obtain additional financing as needed may be restricted Furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt 29 agreements which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt If any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it We may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected The design manufacture sale installation andor servicing of automobiles energy storage products and solar products is a capital intensive business Until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund together with our principal sources of liquidity the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicles energy storage products andor solar products to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness We need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations ramp vehicle production continue research and development projects establish sales delivery and service centers build and deploy Superchargers expand Gigafactory 1 ramp production at Gigafactory 2 and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicles energy storage products and solar products We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected Additionally we use capital from thirdparty investors to enable our customers access to our solar energy systems with little or no upfront cost The availability of this financing depends upon many factors including the confidence of the investors in the solar energy industry the quality and mix of our customer contracts any regulatory changes impacting the economics of our existing customer contracts changes in law including tax law risks or government incentives associated with these financings and our ability to compete with other renewable energy companies for the limited number of potential investors Moreover interest rates are at historically low levels If the rate of return required by investors rises as a result of a rise in interest rates it will reduce the present value of the customer payment streams underlying and therefore the total value of our financing structures increasing our cost of capital If we are unable to establish new financing funds on favorable terms for thirdparty ownership arrangements we may be unable to finance installation of our solar energy system lease or PPA customers systems or our cost of capital could increase and our liquidity may be negatively impacted which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations If we update our manufacturing equipment more quickly than expected we may have to shorten the useful lives of any equipment to be retired as a result of any such update and the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect our financial results We have invested and expect to continue to invest significantly in what we believe is state of the art tooling machinery and other manufacturing equipment for our various product lines and we depreciate the cost of such equipment over their expected useful lives However manufacturing technology may evolve rapidly and we may decide to update our manufacturing process with cuttingedge equipment more quickly than expected Moreover as our engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency increase we may be able to manufacture our products using less of our installed equipment The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our results of operations could be negatively impacted We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results Our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched As we have increased vehicle deliveries in markets outside of the US we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro Chinese yuan Norwegian krone pound sterling and Canadian dollar Any strengthening of the US dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in US dollars as we have historically experienced In addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the Japanese yen If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the US dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured 30 in US dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer Moreover while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact As a result our operating results could be adversely affected We may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles We sell our vehicles directly to consumers We may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the US as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this directtoconsumer sales model In certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses we have opened galleries which are not full retail locations The application of these state laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict Laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so In addition decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model In some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate We have also filed a lawsuit in federal court in Michigan challenging the constitutionality of the states prohibition on direct sales as applied to our business Internationally there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact our business prospects financial condition and results of operations We may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs Others including our competitors may hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our products and services which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business From time to time the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses andor may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights We may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur and such licenses could significantly increase our operating expenses In addition if we are determined to have infringed upon a third partys intellectual property rights we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to redesign our products and services andor to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services In the event that we were required to take one or more such actions our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected In addition any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters Our corporate headquarters the Tesla Factory and Gigafactory 1 are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada If major disasters such as earthquakes or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products We may incur expenses relating to such damages which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 31 Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control Our common stock has experienced an intraday trading high of 38961 per share and a low of 24201 per share over the last 52 weeks The stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies stock including ours regardless of actual operating performance In addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies Moreover stockholder litigation like this has been filed against us in the past While we are continuing to defend such actions vigorously any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which could cause our stock price to decline We provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such as projections regarding sales and production as well as anticipated future revenues gross margins profitability and cash flows Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes and average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions If our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties the market value of our common stock could decline significantly Transactions relating to our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock The conversion of some or all of the Tesla Convertible Notes or the Subsidiary Convertible Notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes Our 150 Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 and the Subsidiary Convertible Notes have been historically and the other Tesla Convertible Notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances If holders elect to convert their convertible notes we could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock In addition the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock Moreover in connection with each issuance of the Tesla Convertible Notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes We also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates In addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions which could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible notes Elon Musk has pledged shares of our common stock to secure certain bank borrowings If Mr Musk were forced to sell these shares pursuant to a margin call that he could not avoid or satisfy such sales could cause our stock price to decline Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third party participants in such offerings and placements We are not a party to these loans which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by 32 Mr Musk If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially and Mr Musk were unable to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged shares Mr Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further Antitakeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws and our convertible notes could impair a takeover attempt Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations In addition the terms of our convertible notes require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change including a takeover of our company Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock I TEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None I TEM 2

from the US Treasury Departments Office of the Inspector General to deliver certain documents in SolarCitys possession that relate to SolarCitys applications for US Treasury grants In February 2013 two financing funds affiliated with SolarCity filed a lawsuit in the US Court of Federal Claims against the US government seeking to recover 140 million that the US Treasury was obligated to pay but failed to pay under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 In February 2016 the US government filed a motion seeking leave to assert a counterclaim against the two plaintiff funds on the grounds that the US government in fact paid them more not less than they were entitled to as a matter of law In September 2017 SolarCity and the US government reached a global settlement of both the investigation and SolarCitys lawsuit In that settlement SolarCity admitted no wrongdoing and agreed to return approximately 5 of the US Treasury cash grants it had received between 2009 and 2013 amounting to 295 million The investigation is now closed and SolarCitys lawsuit has been dismissed Securities Litigation Relating to SolarCitys Financial Statements and Guidance On March 28 2014 a purported stockholder class action was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity and two of its officers The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCitys securities from March 6 2013 to March 18 2014 After a series of amendments to the original complaint the District Court dismissed the amended complaint and entered a judgment in our favor on August 9 2016 The plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal On December 4 2017 the Court heard oral argument on plaintiffs notice of appeal from the dismissal We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit and appeal vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with this lawsuit On August 15 2016 a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity two of its officers and a former officer On March 20 2017 the purported stockholder class filed a consolidated complaint that includes the original matter in the same court against SolarCity one of its officers and three former officers As consolidated the complaint alleges that SolarCity made projections of future sales and installations that it failed to achieve and that these projections were fraudulent when made The suit claimed violations of federal securities laws and sought unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCitys securities from May 6 2015 to May 9 2016 On July 25 2017 the court took SolarCitys fullybriefed motion to dismiss under submission On August 11 2017 the court granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend On September 11 2017 after lead plaintiff determined he would not amend the Court dismissed the action with prejudice and entered judgment in favor of SolarCity and the individual defendants Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition Between September 1 2016 and October 5 2016 seven lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity Following consolidation the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Teslas board of directors and alleges among other things that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks among other relief unspecified monetary damages attorneys fees and costs On January 27 2017 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint Rather than respond to the defendants motion the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint On March 17 2017 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint On December 13 2017 the Court heard oral argument on 34 the motion and reserved decision These same plaintiffs filed a parallel action in the U S District Court for the District of Delaware on April 21 2017 adding claims for violations of the federal securities laws On February 6 2017 a purported stockholder made a demand to inspect Teslas books and records purportedly to investigate potential breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the SolarCity acquisition On April 17 2017 the purported stockholder filed a petition for a writ of mandate in California Superior Court seeking to compel Tesla to provide the documents requested in the demand Tesla filed a demurrer to the writ petition or in the alternative a motion to stay the action On November 9 2017 the court granted Teslas motion and dismissed the action without prejudice On March 24 2017 another lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the District of Delaware by a purported Tesla stockholder challenging the SolarCity acquisition The complaint alleges among other things that Teslas board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition and alleges violations of the federal securities laws We believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with these claims Securities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles On October 10 2017 a purported stockholder class action was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla Inc two of its current officers and a former officer The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May 4 2016 to October 6 2017 The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Companys preparedness to produce Model 3 vehicles We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with this lawsuit Other Matters From time to time we have received requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the National Transportation Safety Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Overview and 2017 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy We design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems and energy storage products We also offer maintenance installation operation and other services related to our products Automotive Our production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan and our Model X sport utility vehicle which are our highestperformance vehicles and our Model 3 a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market which we began to produce and deliver in the second half of 2017 We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced autopilot options Internet connectivity and free overtheair software updates to provide additional safety convenience and performance features In addition we have several future electric vehicles in our product pipeline including those we unveiled in 2017 an electric semitruck and a new version of the Tesla Roadster In 2017 our vehicle production capability continued to scale and gain operational efficiencies and vehicle production volume increased by 20 yearoveryear Additionally we delivered 101420 Model S and Model X vehicles and 1764 Model 3 vehicles in 2017 Energy Generation and Storage We lease and sell solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products to our customers We have partnered with Panasonic to provide capital and operational support to manufacture PV cells thus enabling high volume integrated tile and PV cell production at our Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo New York We also recently commenced Solar Roof production at Gigafactory 2 Our energy storage products which we manufacture at Gigafactory 1 consist of Powerwall mostly for residential applications and Powerpack for commercial industrial and utilityscale applications In late 2017 we completed installation of the largest battery in the world in South Australia This battery delivers electricity during peak hours to help maintain the reliable operation of South Australias electrical infrastructure In 2017 we deployed 358 MWh of energy storage products and 523 MW of solar energy generation Management Opportunities Challenges and Risks and 2018 Outlook Automotive Demand Production and Deliveries We drive demand for our vehicles by continually improving our vehicles through overtheair software updates expanding our retail service and charging infrastructure and by periodically developing and introducing new passenger and commercial electric vehicle variants and models Our goal is to become the best manufacturer in the automotive industry and having cutting edge robotic expertise inhouse is at the core of that goal Our recent acquisitions of advanced automation companies have added to our talent base and are helping us increase vehicle production rates more effectively The worldwide automotive market for alternative fuel vehicles and selfdriving technology are highly competitive and we expect them to become even more so Many companies including established automakers have announced plans to expand and in some cases fully transition to production of electric or environmentally friendly vehicles and to also develop selfdriving technologies We welcome the acceleration of the worlds transition to sustainable transport Nonetheless we believe that the unique features of our vehicles our constant innovation our growing brand the increased affordability introduced with Model 3 our global Supercharger network and our future vehicles will continue to generate incremental demand for our vehicles by making our vehicles accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial markets 39 We expect Model S and Model X deliveries to be approximately 100000 in total in 2018 constrained by the supply of cells with the 18650 form factor used in those vehicles As our sales network continues to expand to new markets in 2018 we believe vehicle orders should continue to grow With demand outpacing production we plan to optimize the trim and option mix in order to optimize revenue and gross margin W e have made significant and sustained progress in the production processes of Model S and Model X and we will continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies for these vehicles in 2018 We expect Model 3 production and deliveries to grow significantly in 2018 The initial phase of manufacturing any new vehicle is always challenging and the Model 3 production ramp has been no exception particularly given our focus on highly automated manufacturing processes that we expect will ultimately result in higher volumes at significantly lower costs Model 3 volume production has been less than we initially anticipated due to production bottlenecks with the battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1 being the primary production constraint to date although future bottlenecks in other areas of vehicle manufacturing may surface We have redirected our best engineering talent to Gigafactory 1 to finetune the automated processes and related robotic programming not only to address the challenges we have experienced but also to continue evaluating our overall manufacturing process for efficiencies Based on our current progress we are targeting a production rate of 2500 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and 5000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of the second quarter It is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time We are systematically addressing bottlenecks and adding capacity and resources in places like the battery module line where we have experienced constraints and these actions should result in our Model 3 production rate significantly increasing during the first half of 2018 In some cases we may not achieve the manufacturing labor efficiencies until we ramp up to fully automated manufacturing lines which may take us longer than anticipated In order to optimize the incremental improvement of our automation processes and the efficiency of our capital expenditures we will implement the capacity to further ramp production to 10000 units per week only after we have achieved a 5000 units per week run rate We are also making strides in other aspects of our vehicle production deliveries and customer infrastructure For example we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles due to economies of scale material cost reductions and more efficient manufacturing and equipment utilization We have achieved cost improvements through material cost reductions from both engineering and commercial actions and increased manufacturing efficiencies including better inventory control for Model S and Model X We have also seen improved product reliability in our vehicles batteries and drive units Likewise we may experience infrastructure constraints and customer experience issues relating to vehicle deliveries but are trying to address such issues by opening additional delivery and service centers to scale the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver Generally as sales of Tesla vehicles ramp in 2018 we plan to continue to open new Tesla retail locations service centers and delivery hubs around the world we plan continue to expand our mobile repair services and we plan to significantly increase the number of Superchargers and Destination Charging connectors globally with the goal of remaining ahead of the Model 3 ramp We are also making progress with our selfdriving technology An overhaul of the underlying architecture of our software has been completed which has enabled a stepchange improvement in the collection and analysis of data and fundamentally enhanced its machine learning capabilities The aggregate of such data and learnings which we refer to as our neural net is able to collect and analyze more highquality data than ever before enabling us to rollout a series of new autopilot features in 2018 and beyond Energy Generation and Storage Demand Production and Deployment We are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products including by cutting advertising spend and increasingly selling these products in Tesla stores with dedicated energy product sales personnel and leveraging channel partnerships Moreover we have deemphasized absolute volume growth for our solar products and we have instead prioritized projects for cash generation and profitability Solar Roof installations will initially ramp slowly in the first half of 2018 As Solar Roof is truly the firstofitskind and there is significant complexity in both its manufacturing and installation we are deliberately ramping production at a gradual pace to 40 ensure reliability and a great customer experience With demand outpacing production we expect our backlog to remain in excess of one year for the next several quarters We expect energy storage products to experience significant growth with our aim being to at least triple our sales in 2018 We are ramping up production for these products at our Gigafactory 1 over the next several quarters but demand is greater than our current production capacity for energy storage We expect energy generation and storage gross margin to improve significantly in 2018 as we enter the year with a backlog of highermargin commercial solar projects and a more profitable energy storage business due to overall cost and manufacturing efficiencies from scaling Trends in Cash Flow Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses Capital expenditures in 2018 are projected to be slightly more than 2017 with the majority of the spending to support increases in Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory 1 and the Tesla Factory and for building additional stores service centers and Superchargers We expect operating expenses to grow in 2018 as compared to 2017 although operating expenses should decrease significantly as a percentage of revenue due to the significant increase in expected revenue in 2018 and as we focus on increasing operational efficiency The growth in operating expense will mainly be driven by engineering design and testing of new products or changes to existing products and higher sales and service costs associated with expanding our worldwide geographic presence In addition we expect operating expenses to increase as a result of increased selling general and administrative expenses incurred by our energy generation and storage business We are seeking stockholder approval for a new 10year CEO performance award for Elon Musk with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones If Tesla stockholders approve the award we would incur significant additional stockbased compensation expense over the term of the award as each performance milestone becomes probable of vesting Automotive Financing Options We offer loans and leases for our vehicles in certain markets in North America Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions We offered resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to all direct customers who purchase vehicles and who financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners Subsequent to June 30 2016 this program is available only in certain international markets Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following December 31 2017 totaled 3757 million in value We plan to adopt the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 effective January 1 2018 This will impact the way we account for vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners which now will qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return In addition for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018 we will cease recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our nearterm cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used cars in a timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flows Through 2017 we only had an insignificant number of customers who exercised their resale value guarantees and returned their vehicles to us Based on current market demand for our cars we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts Should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially We currently offer vehicle leases in the US for Model S and Model X directly from Tesla Finance our captive financing entity as well as through leasing partners Leasing through Tesla Finance is available in 39 states and the District of Columbia We also offer financing arrangements through our entities in Canada Germany and the 41 United Kingdom Leasing through our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk In addition for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities we assume customer credit risk We plan to continue expanding our financing offerings including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them and to support the overall financing needs of our customers To the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive our sales financial results and cash flows could be negatively impacted Energy Generation and Storage Financing Options We offer our customers the choice to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar energy systems produce through various contractual arrangements These contractual arrangements include longterm leases and power purchase agreements In both structures we install our solar energy systems at our customers premises and charge the customer a monthly fee In the lease structure this monthly payment is fixed with a minimum production guarantee In the power purchase agreement structure we charge customers a fee per kilowatthour or kWh based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces The leases and power purchase agreements are typically for 20 years with a renewal option and generally when there is no upfront prepayment the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations For customers who want to purchase and own solar energy systems we also offer solar loans whereby a thirdparty lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system designed installed and serviced by us We enter into a standard solar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer Separately the customer enters into a loan agreement with a thirdparty lender who finances the full purchase price We are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the thirdparty lender and the thirdparty lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan Gigafactory 1 We continue to develop Gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material cells modules battery packs and drive units in one location for vehicles and energy storage products We also continue to invest in the future expansion of Gigafactory 1 and in production equipment for battery cell module and pack production Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery cells Under our arrangement with Panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices As these terms convey to us the right to use as defined in ASC 840 Leases their production equipment we consider them to be leased assets when production commences This results in us recording the value of their production equipment within property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations For all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at Gigafactory 1 we will apply similar accounting During the year ended December 31 2017 we recorded 4733 million on the consolidated balance sheet While we currently believe that our progress at Gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets our ultimate ability to do so will require us to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp For example we have experienced bottlenecks in the assembly of battery modules at Gigafactory 1 which has negatively affected our production of Model 3 While we continue to make progress to resolve such issues at Gigafactory 1 given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating Gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and Gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate Gigafactory 2 We have an agreement with the SUNY Foundation for the construction of a factory capable of producing at least 10 gigawatts of solar cells annually in Buffalo New York referred to as Gigafactory 2 In December 2016 we entered into an agreement with Panasonic under which it will manufacture custom PV cells and modules for us primarily at Gigafactory 2 and we will purchase certain quantities of PV cells and modules from Panasonic during the 10year term 42 The terms of our agreement with the SUNY Foundation require us to comply with a number of covenants and any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation and result in termination of the agreement Although we remain on track with our progress at Gigafactory 2 our expectations as to the cost of building the facility acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits Other Manufacturing In addition we continue to expand production capacity at our Tesla Factory and are exploring additional production capacity in Asia and Europe Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US GAAP The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures We base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period Accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies Accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for products and services when i a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii pricing or fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured Automotive Segment Automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multipleelement accounting guidance including free internet connectivity free access to our Supercharger network and future free overtheair software updates These other elements are valued on a standalone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period which is generally the eightyear life of the vehicle except for internet connectivity which is over the free fouryear period If we sell a deliverable separately we use that pricing to determine its fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available At the time of revenue recognition we record a reserve against revenue for estimated future product returns Such estimates are based on historical experience and were immaterial in all periods presented In addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customers lender when we arrange the financing would be recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue in accordance with ASC 60550 Customer Payments and Incentives Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as programs with resale value guarantees See Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and Direct Vehicle Leasing Program for further details Service and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services service plans merchandise sales of used Tesla vehicles sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and sales of nonTesla vehicle tradeins 43 Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee Prior to June 30 2016 we offered resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to all customers who purchased vehicles and who financed their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners Since June 30 2016 this program is available only in certain international markets Under this program customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a determined resale value Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery we are required to account for these transactions as operating leases The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue If a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain leasing partners As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to endcustomers we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840 Under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantees for the longterm portion and deferred revenue for the current portion We accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheet and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement Cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows At the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue On a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values Direct Vehicle Leasing Program We offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the North America and Europe Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months At the end of the lease term customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing if for a predetermined residual value We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and we recognize leasing revenues on a straightline basis over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue 44 Maintenance and Service Plans We offer a prepaid maintenance program for our vehicles which includes plans covering maintenance for up to four years or up to 50000 miles provided these services are purchased within a specified period of time The maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts excluding tires and the battery Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations We also offer an extended service plan which covers the repair or replacement of vehicle parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50000 miles after the end of our initial New Vehicle Limited Warranty provided they are purchased within a specified period of time Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the service coverage periods Energy Generation and Storage Segment For solar energy systems and components sales wherein customers pay the full purchase price either directly or through the solar loan program revenue is recognized when we install a solar energy system and the solar energy system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met In instances where there are multiple deliverables in a single arrangement we allocate the arrangement consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on the relative selling price method Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included in inventories as workinprogress in the consolidated balance sheet However any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against energy generation and storage revenue in accordance with ASC 60550 Customer Payments and Incentives Revenue from an energy storage product sale is recognized when the product has been delivered installed and accepted by the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for solar energy systems including energy storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met For incentives that are earned based on the amount of electricity generated by the system we record revenue as the amounts are earned The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for in substance as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840 Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which are recognized as revenue over the lease term as well as the fees charged for remote monitoring service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term We capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or PPAs ie the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems leased and to be leased net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or PPA Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis In addition cost for solar energy systems are recorded using actual cost We record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts If our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff 45 We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product Once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results Warranties We provide a manufacturers warranty on all new and used vehicles production powertrain components and systems and energy products we sell In addition we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenue StockBased Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units RSUs granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan the ESPP to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards The fair value of stock options and ESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using the BlackScholes optionpricing model The BlackScholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP Stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period prior to 2017 net of estimated projected forfeitures For performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable For performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations As we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods Stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense Income Taxes We are subject to federal and state taxes in the US and in many foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans Tax laws regulations and 46 administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals The US many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard As of December 31 2017 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net US deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our US deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted Furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions In the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain As a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome These effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities We are required to file income tax returns in the US and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made On December 22 2017 the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act was enacted into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code Changes include but are not limited to a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after December 31 2017 the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as remeasuring our US deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net US deferred tax assets In December 2017 the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act SAB 118 which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date Since the Tax Act was enacted late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations are expected over the next 12 months we consider the accounting of deferred tax remeasurements and other items such as state tax considerations to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final yearend data and tax positions We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118 We do not expect any subsequent adjustments to have any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net US deferred tax assets Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810 Consolidation we consolidate any variable interest entity VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary We form VIEs with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as VIEs through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not 47 considered the primary beneficiary We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of VIEs We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements We have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value HLBV method We therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries Under the HLBV method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the thirdparties The thirdparties interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties However the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets Business Combinations We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805 Business Combinations The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred Identifiable assets including intangible assets liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date When determining such fair values we make significant estimates and assumptions Critical estimates include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates Our estimate of fair values is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable As a result actual results may differ from our estimates Furthermore our estimates might change as additional information becomes available as more fully discussed in Note 3 Business Combinations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K 48 Results of

7000132 4046025 4758619 68 2954107 73 Automotive Services and Other Segment Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to sale of new Model S Model X and Model 3 vehicles including internet connectivity Supercharger access and specified software updates for cars equipped with autopilot hardware as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for Model S and Model X vehicles sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting We do not yet offer leasing for Model 3 vehicles Services and other revenue consists of maintenance services sales of used vehicles and sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers 2017 Compared to 2016 Automotive sales revenue increased 295 billion or 53 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 primarily related to a 58 increase in deliveries to 80060 vehicles resulting from increased sales of Model S and Model X at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the prior period as well as sales of 1764 Model 3 vehicles since its launch in the third quarter of 2017 Additionally there was an increase of 580 million to 3603 million in sales of regulatory credits offset partially by additional deferrals of autopilot 20 revenue in the year ended December 31 2017 Automotive leasing revenue increased 3448 million or 45 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 The increase was primarily due to an approximately 30 increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended December 31 2016 In addition during the year ended December 31 2017 we recognized an increase of 234 million of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and expiration of resale value guarantees as compared to the year ended December 31 2016 Service and other revenue increased 5332 million or 114 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales as a result of increased automotive sales as well as from the expansion of our tradein program Additionally there was a 411 million increase from the inclusion of engineering service revenue from Grohmann which we acquired on January 3 2017 and a 684 million increase in maintenance services revenue as our fleet continued to grow during the year ended December 31 2017 49 2016 Compared to 2015 Automotive sales revenue increased 216 billion or 63 to 559 billion during the year ended December 31 2016 compared to the year ended December 31 2015 primarily related to a 55 increase in vehicle deliveries to approximately 50700 The increase in volume is primarily due to a fullyear of Model X deliveries in 2016 as well as increased production and sales of Model S Further there was an overall increase in average selling price of 6 primarily due to the introduction of Model X which are higher priced vehicles compared to Model S In addition there is an increase of 1334 million to 3023 million of the sale of regulatory credits from the year ended December 31 2015 to the corresponding period in 2016 These increases were partially offset by negative impact from the movement of foreign currency exchange rates Automotive leasing revenue increased 4524 million or 146 to 7618 million during the year ended December 31 2016 compared to the year ended December 31 2015 The increase was primarily due to an 83 increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with a resale value guarantee from the year ended December 31 2015 to the year ended December 31 2016 In addition during the year ended December 31 2016 we recognized 1126 million in automotive leasing revenue upon the expiration of resale value guarantees Service and other revenue increased 1774 million or 61 to 4680 million during the year ended December 31 2016 compared to the year ended December 31 2015 primarily due to an increase of 1174 million in used vehicle sales as we received more tradeins and an increase in maintenance service revenue of 666 million as our fleet continues to grow Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sale of solar energy systems and energy storage products leasing revenue from solar energy systems under operating leases and PPAs and the sale of solar energy systems incentives 2017 Compared to 2016 Energy generation and storage revenue increased by 9349 million or 515 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 predominantly due to the inclusion of the fullyear of revenue from our solar business which we gained by acquiring SolarCity on November 21 2016 2016 Compared to 2015 Energy generation and storage revenue increased 1669 million or 1153 primarily due to 841 million as a result of the inclusion of revenue from SolarCity from the acquisition date of November 21 2016 through December 31 2016 as well as an increase of 828 million in energy storage revenue as we ramped up our energy storage sales effort and completed several utility scale projects such as Southern California Edison Mira Loma substation 50 Cost of

parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred Cost of services and other revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers costs associated with providing maintenance services and costs to acquire and certify used vehicles 2017 Compared to 2016 Cost of automotive sales revenues increased 246 billion or 58 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This was primarily due to a 58 increase in vehicle deliveries resulting from increased sales of Model S and Model X as well as the commencement of deliveries of Model 3 in the third quarter of 2017 Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 2262 million or 47 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This was primarily due to an approximately 30 increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended December 31 2016 In addition during the year ended December 31 2017 we recognized an increase of 234 million in cost of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and the expiration of resale value guarantees Cost of services and other revenue increased 7566 million or 160 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 primarily due to the increase in cost of used vehicle sales due to increased volume and the increase in cost to provide maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 25 to 23 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 The commencement of deliveries of Model 3 in the third quarter of 2017 whereby the full operating costs and depreciation were recorded at much lower production volumes as production ramps higher current period early payoffs and expirations of resale value guarantees as compared to the same period in the prior year contributed to the lower gross margin Lower material and manufacturing costs for Model S and Model X as we further improved our vehicle production processes and the partial recognition of autopilot 20 revenue in the current period partially offset the overall decrease Gross margin for total automotive services and other segment decreased from 23 to 19 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 These decreases are driven by the factors impacting gross margin for total automotive as explained above as well as higher costs of maintenance service 2016 Compared to 2015 Cost of automotive revenues increased 163 billion or 62 to 427 billion during the year ended December 31 2016 compared to the year ended December 31 2015 The increase was primarily due to a 55 increase in vehicle deliveries as a result of a fullyear of Model X deliveries as well as increased deliveries for Model S In addition the increase is due to product mix as Model X has a higher cost structure than Model S The increase in cost of automotive revenue is partially offset by a reduction of warranty expense of 200 million resulting from better vehicle reliability 52 Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 2986 million or 163 to 4820 million during the year ended December 31 2016 compared to the year ended December 31 2015 The increase is primarily due to an 83 increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees from the year ended December 31 2015 to the year ended December 31 2016 In addition during the year ended December 31 2016 we recognized 1143 million in cost of automotive leasing revenues upon the expiration of resale value guarantees Cost of services and other revenue increased 1855 million or 65 to 4725 million during the year ended December 31 2016 compared to the year ended December 31 2015 primarily due to an increase of 1208 million in cost of used vehicle sales due to increase in volume and an increase of 649 million in cost to provide maintenance service as our fleet continues to grow Gross margin for total automotive remained consistent during the year ended December 31 2016 compared to the year ended December 31 2015 Gross profit for total automotive services and other segment increased from 9213 million for the year ended December 31 2015 to 160 billion for the year ended December 31 2016 Gross margin for total automotive services and other segment increased from 229 for the year ended December 31 2015 to 234 for the year ended December 31 2016 The increase was primarily due to lower material and manufacturing costs as we further improve our production processes partially offset by a negative impact from the movement in foreign exchange and increased expenditures to build out our service centers and provide maintenance Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct material and labor costs overhead of solar energy systems and energy storage products and the depreciation expense and maintenance costs associated with leased solar energy systems 2017 Compared to 2016 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 6962 million or 390 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This was primarily due to the inclusion of the fullyear of costs from our solar business which we gained by acquiring SolarCity on November 21 2016 Gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 2 to 22 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This was predominantly due to the inclusion of the fullyear of revenue and costs from our solar business which we gained by acquiring SolarCity 2016 Compared to 2015 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased 1660 million to 1783 million during the year ended December 31 2016 compared to the year ended December 31 2015 The increase was due to an increase of 670 million as a result of the inclusion of SolarCitys financial results from the acquisition date of November 21 2016 to December 31 2016 The remaining increase was due to increase in the sale of energy storage products and increased expenditures to increase the capacity of energy storage products Research and Development Expense Year Ended December 31 Change 2017 vs 2016 Change 2016 vs 2015 Dollars in thousands 2017

increased 5437 million or 65 during the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This increase was primarily due t o a 2749 million increase in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount as a result of our acquisitions as well as headcount growth from the expansion of our automotiv e and energy generation and storage businesses and a 443 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants Additionally there were increases in facilities expenses depreciation expenses professional and outside service expenses and expensed materials to support the development of future products RD expenses increased 1165 million or 16 to 8344 million during the year ended December 31 2016 compared to the year ended December 31 2015 The increase of 1165 million was primarily due to a 782 million increase in employee and labor related expenses due to a 15 headcount increase as we expanded our vehicle business in the US and internationally and a 650 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants This is partially offset by a 259 million decrease in expensed materials related to our Model X development which was primarily incurred in 2015 The overall increase also includes 110 million related to SolarCity Selling General and Administrative Expense Year Ended December 31

growth from the expansion of our automotive and energy generation and storage businesses and a 649 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of

expenses to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and a 1406 million increase in professional and outside service expenses to support the growth of our business SGA expenses increased 5100 million or 55 to 143 billion during the year ended December 31 2016 compared to the year ended December 31 2015 The increase

percentage of revenues 4 3 3 Interest expense for the year ended December 31 2017 increased 2724 million or 137 from the year ended December 31 2016 The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the fullyear of interest expense from SolarCity of 1855 million for the year ended December 31 2017 In addition our average outstanding indebtedness has increased in the year ended December 31 2017 as compared to the prior year mainly due to the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 and the Senior Notes due in 2025 both of which we issued during 2017 Interest expense for the year ended December 31 2016 increased 800 million or 67 from the year ended December 31 2015 The increase as compared to the year ended December 31 2015 consisted primarily of a 331 million increase in interest expense on

SolarCitys indebtedness financing obligations and capital lease obligations Other Income Expense Net Year Ended December 31 Change 2017 vs 2016 Change 2016 vs 2015 Dollars in thousands 2017 2016 2015 Other income expense net 125373 111272 41652 236645 213 152924 367 As a percentage of revenues 1 2 1 Other income expense net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates Additionally other income expense net includes a gain from the acquisition of SolarCity for the year ended December 31 2016 Other income expense net decreased by 2367 million or 213 during the year ended December 31 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31 2016 The decrease was primarily due to measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair value of SolarCity and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Other income net increased by 1529 million as we recognized a gain from the acquisition of SolarCity of 887 million and a loss on conversion of our 150 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018 of 72 million The remainder of the change in other income expense net was primarily result of fluctuations in gains losses from foreign currency exchange Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31

increased by 49 million or 18 for the year ended December 31 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This increase was primarily due to the increase in vehicle deliveries in foreign tax jurisdictions partially offset by 105 million of future US alternative minimum tax refunds as a result of the Tax Act which previously had an associated valuation allowance 55 Our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 2016 and 2015 was 267 million and 130 million respectively This increase was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in our international jurisdictions Net Income Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Our net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31 2017 we had 337 billion of cash and cash equivalents Balances held in foreign currencies had a US dollar equivalent of 5215 million and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan euros and Norwegian kroner Our sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research and development projects investments in tooling and manufacturing equipment for the production ramp of Model 3 the continued construction of Gigafactory 1 and the continued expansion of our retail stores service centers mobile repair services and Supercharger network We are growing our vehicle manufacturing capacity primarily to fulfill Model 3 production at 5000 vehicles per week and in a later phase to 10000 vehicles per week Capital expenditures in 2018 are projected to be slightly more than 2017 We continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business We have an agreement to spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10year period following full production at Gigafactory 2 We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at Gigafactory 2 and other operations within the State of New York and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months A large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings stores service centers delivery centers and Supercharger network We may need or want to raise additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them or at all If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected In addition we had 204 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown For details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds refer to Note 13 Convertible and LongTerm Debt Obligations and Note 18 VIE Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included

significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales lease payments directly from customers customer deposits sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products These cash inflows are offset by our 56 payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process employee compensation operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31 2017 decreased by 632 million as compared to the year ended December 31 2016 due to the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 1973 million partially offset by the decrease in net loss excluding noncash expenses and gains of 1341 million The decrease in working capital was mainly driven by faster processing of payments for our vehicles and our focus on reducing inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017 During the year ended December 31 2016 cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of 7730 million the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 7506 million as our business expanded the increase in resale value guarantees of 3269 million and deferred revenue of 3830 million as the number of vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased and the increase in customer deposits of 3884 million primarily due to Model 3 reservations These increases were partially offset by the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of 247 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee During the year ended December 31 2015 cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of 8887 million and the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of 157 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee These increases were partially offset by the increase in resale value guarantees of 4423 million and deferred revenue of 3222 million as the number vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures which were 408 billion during 2017 144 billion during 2016 and 163 billion during 2015 Capital expenditures during 2017 were from 341 billion of purchases of property and equipment mainly for Model 3

debt includes our nonrecourse indebtedness of 293 billion Nonrecourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only specified assets of our subsidiaries The table above excludes unrecognized tax

unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which were established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies Our foreign operations expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries and against the US dollar Upon consolidation as foreign currency exchange rates vary revenues and expenses may be significantly impacted and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of our monetary assets and liabilities including intercompany balances As of December 31 2017 our largest foreign currency exposures were from the euro Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone 58 We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the nearterm These reasonably possible adverse changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies as of December 31 2017 to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income loss before income taxes These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact of 1160 million Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates Pursuant to our risk management policies in certain cases we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes A hypothetical 10 change in our interest rates would have increased our interest expense for the year ended December 31 2017 by 76 million 59 I TEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The sections titled Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Consolidated Balance Sheets Consolidated Statements of

manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and design manufacture install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage products Our Chief Executive Officer as the chief operating decision maker CODM organizes the Company manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating segments i automotive and ii energy generation and storage Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 810 Consolidation we consolidate any variable interest entity VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary We form VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as VIEs through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of VIEs see Note 18 VIE Arrangements We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation Reclassifications Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and disclosures in the accompanying notes Estimates are used for but not limited to determining the selling price of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining the amortization period of these elements the collectability of accounts receivable inventory valuation fair value of longlived assets fair value of financial instruments residual value of operating lease vehicles depreciable lives of property and equipment and solar energy systems fair value and residual value of solar energy systems subject to leases warranty liabilities income taxes contingencies the accrued liability for solar energy system performance guarantees determining lease passthrough financing obligations the discount rates used to determine the fair value of investment tax credits the valuation of buildtosuit lease assets fair value of interest rate swaps and inputs used to value stockbased compensation In addition estimates and assumptions are used for the accounting for business combinations including the fair values and useful lives of acquired assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities Actual results could differ from those estimates 68 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for products and services when i a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance iii pricing or fees are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured Automotive Revenue Automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and specific other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multipleelement accounting guidance including free internet connectivity free access to our Supercharger network and future free overtheair software updates These other elements are valued on a standalone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period which is generally the eightyear life of the vehicle except for internet connectivity which is over the free fouryear period If we sell a deliverable separately we use that pricing to determine its fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available At the time of revenue recognition we record a reserve against revenue for estimated future product returns Such estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented In addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customers lender when we arrange the financing would be recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue in accordance with ASC 60550 Customer Payments and Incentives As of December 31 2017 and 2016 we had deferred 4989 million and 2912 million respectively related to the purchase of vehicle maintenance and service plans access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot and overtheair software updates Automotive Leasing Revenue Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as programs with resale value guarantees See Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and Direct Vehicle Leasing Program for further details Resale Value Guarantees and Other Financing Programs Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee Prior to June 30 2016 we offered resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to all customers who purchased vehicles and who financed their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners Since June 30 2016 this program is available only in certain international markets Under this program customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a determined resale value Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery we are required to account for these transactions as operating leases The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue If a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory As of December 31 2017 and 2016 3757 million and 1795 million respectively of the guarantees were exercisable by customers within the next 12 months 69 Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to certain leasing partners As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to endcustomers we account for these transactions as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840 Leases Under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantees for the longterm portion and deferred revenue for the current portion We accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheet and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement Cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows At the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program should we decide to repurchase all vehicles was 7429 million and 8559 million as of December 31 2017 and 2016 respectively including 4116 million within a 12month period from December 31 2017 As of December 31 2017 and 2016 we had 164 billion and 118 billion of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantees and 3395 million and 2891 million recorded in deferred revenue liability respectively As of December 31 2017 and 2016 we had a total of 262 million and 570 million respectively in accounts receivable from our leasing partners On a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values 70 Activity related to our resale value guarantee and similar programs consisted of the following in thousands Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Operating Lease Vehicles Operating lease vehiclesbeginning of period 2462061

locations in the North America and Europe Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months At the end of the lease term 71 customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases and we recognize leasing revenues on a straightline basis over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue As of December 31 2017 and 2016 we had deferred 966 million and 672 million respectively of leaserelated upfront payments which will be recognized on a straightline basis over the contractual term of the individual leases Lease revenues are recorded in automotive leasing revenue and for the years ended December 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we recognized 2206 million 1127 million and 412 million respectively Regulatory Credits California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zeroemission vehicles These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zeroemission vehicles may earn regulatory credits ZEV credits and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to greenhouse gas GHG emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers As a manufacturer solely of zeroemission vehicles we have earned emission credits such as ZEV and GHG credits on our vehicles and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future We enter into contractual agreements with thirdparties to purchase our regulatory credits We recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time legal title to the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations Revenue from the sale of regulatory credits totaled 3603 million 3023 million and 1687 million for the years ended December 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Additionally we have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that will provide abatements for sales use real property personal property and employer excise taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits These incentives are available for the applicable periods beginning on October 17 2014 and ending on June 30 2034 subject to capital investments by us and our partners for Gigafactory 1 of at least 350 billion in the aggregate on or before June 30 2024 which were met as of December 31 2017 and certain other conditions specified in the agreements If we do not satisfy one or more conditions under the agreement we would be required to repay to the respective taxing authorities the amounts of the tax incentives incurred plus interest As of December 31 2017 and 2016 we had earned 1630 million and 45 million respectively of transferable tax credits under these agreements We record these credits as earned when we have evidence there is a market for their sale Credits are applied as a cost offset to either employee expense or to capital assets depending on the source of the credits Credits earned from employee hires or capital spending by our partners at Gigafactory 1 are recorded as a reduction to operating expenses Service and Other Revenue Service and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services service plans merchandise sales of used Tesla vehicles sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and sales of nonTesla vehicle tradeins Energy Generation and Storage Segment For solar energy systems and components sales wherein customers pay the full purchase price either directly or through the solar loan program revenue is recognized when we install a solar energy system and the solar energy system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met In instances where there are multiple deliverables in a single arrangement we allocate the arrangement consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on the relative selling price method Costs incurred on residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included in inventories as workinprogress in the consolidated balance sheet However any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against energy generation and storage revenue in accordance with ASC 60550 Customer Payments and Incentives Revenue from an energy storage product sale is recognized when the product has been delivered installed and accepted by the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 72 For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for solar energy systems including energy storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met For incentives that are earned based on the amount of electricity generated by the system we record revenue as the amounts are earned The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under power purchase agreements we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for in substance as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840 Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which are recognized as revenue over the lease term as well as the fees charged for remote monitoring service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term As of December 31 2017 and 2016 deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to 3200 million and 2682 million respectively As of December 31 2017 and 2016 deferred revenue from rebates and incentives was not material We capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or power purchase agreements ie the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems leased and to be leased net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or power purchase agreement Cost of Revenue Automotive Cost of automotive revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including amortized tooling costs shipping and logistic costs vehicle internet connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses Cost of automotive revenue also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to writedown the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for onhand inventory that is either obsolete or in excess of forecasted demand Automotive Leasing Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred Service and Other Cost of service and other revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead associated with sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers costs associated with providing maintenance and development services and costs associated with sales of used vehicles Energy Generation and Storage Energy generation and storage cost of revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets In addition where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs Sales and Other Use Taxes Taxes assessed by various government entities such as sales use and value added taxes collected at the time of sale are excluded from automotive net sales and revenue 73 Transportation Costs Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue and the related transportation costs are included in cost of automotive revenue Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred Marketing Promotional and Advertising Costs Marketing promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations We incurred marketing promotional and advertising costs of 665 million 480 million and 583 million in the years ended December 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively Income Taxes Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense Comprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss Other comprehensive income loss consists of unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges and availableforsale marketable securities and foreign currency translation adjustments that have been excluded from the determination of net income loss StockBased Compensation We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all sharebased payments including stock options restricted stock units RSUs and our employee stock purchase plan the ESPP The fair value of stock options and the ESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using the BlackScholes optionpricing model The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock Stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period net of actual forfeitures in the period prior to 2017 net of estimated projected forfeitures Stockbased compensation associated with awards assumed from the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation SolarCity is measured as of the acquisition date using the relevant assumptions and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining requisite service period net of actual forfeitures in the period prior to 2017 net of estimated projected forfeitures For performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable For performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations see Note 15 Equity Incentive Plans Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems 74 and vehicles under operating leases We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements We have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value HLBV method We therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries Under the HLBV method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the thirdparties The thirdparties interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties However the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets Net Income Loss per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders Basic net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income loss attributable to common stockholders by the weightedaverage shares of common stock outstanding for the period Potentially dilutive shares which are based on the weightedaverage shares of common stock underlying outstanding stockbased awards warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the ifconverted method as applicable are included when calculating diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive Since we expect to settle in cash the principal outstanding under the 025 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 the 125 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021 and the 2375 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 we use the treasury stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect if any The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders because their effect was antidilutive Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 Stockbased awards 10456363 12091473 15592736 Convertible senior notes 2315463 841191 2431265 Warrants 579137 262702 1049791 Business Combinations We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805 Business Combinations The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred Identifiable assets including intangible assets liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents Our cash equivalents are primarily comprised of money market funds 75 Restricted Cash and Deposits We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash as collateral for our sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee letters of credit real estate leases insurance policies credit card borrowing facilities and certain operating leases In addition restricted cash includes cash received from certain fund investors that have not been released for use by us and cash held to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to sales of powertrain systems sales of energy generation and storage products receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies We provide an allowance against accounts receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected We writeoff accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible We typically do not carry significant accounts receivable related to our vehicle and related sales as customer payments are due prior to vehicle delivery except for amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved financing arrangements between our customers and the financial institutions MyPower Customer Notes Receivable We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program MyPower was offered by SolarCity to provide residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30year loan The outstanding balances net of any allowance for potentially uncollectible amounts are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as MyPower customer notes receivable net of current portion for the longterm portion In determining the allowance and credit quality for customer notes receivable we identify significant customers with known disputes or collection issues and also consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses Customer notes receivable that are individually impaired are chargedoff as a writeoff of the allowance for losses Since acquisition there have been no new significant customers with known disputes or collection issues and the amount of potentially uncollectible amounts has been insignificant Accordingly we did not establish an allowance for losses against customer notes receivable In addition there were no material nonaccrual or past due customer notes receivable as of December 31 2017 Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash cash equivalents restricted cash accounts receivable and interest rate swaps Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the US At times these deposits may be in excess of insured limits As of December 31 2017 no entity represented 10 or more of our total accounts receivable balance As of December 31 2016 one entity represented approximately 10 of our total accounts receivable balance The risk of concentration for our interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highlyrated multinational banks Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are single source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis In addition cost 76 for solar energy systems are recorded using actual cost We record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts If our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product Once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results Operating Lease Vehicles Vehicles delivered under our resale value guarantee program vehicles that are leased as part of our leasing programs as well as any vehicles that are sold with a significant buyback guarantee are classified as operating lease vehicles as the related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases Operating lease vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the expected operating lease term The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31 2017 and 2016 was 485 billion and 353 billion respectively Accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicles as of December 31 2017 and 2016 was 7333 million and 3995 million respectively Solar Energy Systems Leased and To Be Leased We are the lessor of solar energy systems under leases that qualify as operating leases Our leases are accounted for in accordance with ASC 840 To determine lease classification we evaluate the lease terms to determine whether there is a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease whether the lease term is greater than 75 of the useful life or whether the present value of the minimum lease payments exceed 90 of the fair value at lease inception We utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful lives and fair values at lease inception and residual values at lease termination Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows Solar energy systems leased to customers 30 to 35 years Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs Lease term up to 25 years Solar energy systems held for lease to customers are installed systems pending interconnection with the respective utility companies and will be depreciated as solar energy systems leased to customers when they have been interconnected and placed inservice Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation which will be depreciated as solar energy systems leased to customers when they are completed interconnected and leased to customers Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer lease agreements 77 Property Plant and Equipment Property plant and equipment including leasehold improvements are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization Depreciation is generally computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows Machinery equipment vehicles and office furniture 2 to 12 years Building and building improvements 15 to 30 years Computer equipment and software 3 to 10 years Depreciation for tooling is computed using the unitsofproduction method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life of the respective assets As of December 31 2017 the estimated productive life for Model S and X tooling was 250000 vehicles based on our current estimates of production As of December 31 2017 the estimated productive life for Model 3 tooling was 1000000 vehicles based on our current estimates of production Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straightline basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases Upon the retirement or sale of our property plant and equipment the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction Capitalized interest on constructioninprogress is included within property plant and equipment and is amortized over the life of the related assets Furthermore we are deemed to be the owner for accounting purposes during the construction phase of certain longlived assets under buildtosuit lease arrangements because of our involvement with the construction our exposure to any potential cost overruns or our other commitments under the arrangements In these cases we recognize buildtosuit lease assets under construction and corresponding buildtosuit lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 840 Once construction is completed if a lease meets certain saleleaseback criteria we remove the asset and liability and account for the lease as an operating lease Otherwise the lease is accounted for as a capital lease LongLived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets We review our property plant and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate If the asset is not recoverable its carrying amount would be adjusteddown to its fair value We have recognized no material impairments of our longlived assets in any of the periods presented Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives which range from two to thirty years Capitalization of Software Costs For costs incurred in development of internal use software we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage Costs related to preliminary project activities and postimplementation activities are expensed as incurred Internal use software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life of three to ten years We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 78 Foreign Currency We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in which they operate In cases where the functional currency is not the US dollar we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to accumulated deficits including current period income or loss and the balance sheet For each subsidiary we apply the monthly average functional currency rate to its income or loss and the monthend functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet Beginning on January 1 2015 the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries was changed to their local countrys currency This change was based on the culmination of facts and circumstances that had developed as we expanded our foreign operations The adjustment of 100 million attributable to the translation of nonmonetary assets and liabilities as of the date of change is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operations For the years ended December 31 2017 2016 and 2015 we recorded foreign currency transaction gains losses of 523 million 261 million and 456 million respectively Warranties We provide a manufacturers warranty on all new and used vehicles production powertrain components and systems and energy products we sell In addition we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or power purchase agreements as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following in thousands Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 Accrued warrantybeginning of period 266655 180754 129043 Assumed warranty liability from acquisition 4737 31366 Warranty costs incurred 122510 79147 52760 Net changes in liability for preexisting warranties including expirations and foreign exchange impact 4342 20084 1470 Provision for warranty 248566 153766 103001 Accrued warrantyend of period 401790 266655 180754 For the years ended December 31 2017 and 2016 warranty costs incurred for vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements were 355 million and 190 million respectively Solar Energy Systems Performance Guarantees We guarantee certain specified minimum solar energy production output for certain solar energy systems leased or sold to customers generally for a term of up to 30 years We monitor the solar energy systems to ensure that these outputs are being achieved We evaluate if any amounts are due to our customers and make any payments periodically as specified in the customer agreements As of December 31 2017 and 2016 we had recognized a 79 liability of 63 million and 66 million respectively within accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees based on our assessment of the exposure Solar Renewable Energy Credits We account for solar renewable energy credits SRECs when they are purchased by us or sold to thirdparties For SRECs generated by solar energy systems owned by us and minted by government agencies we do not recognize any specifically identifiable costs for those SRECs as there are no specific incremental costs incurred to generate the SRECs For SRECs purchased by us we record these SRECs at their cost subject to impairment testing We recognize revenue from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer and the cost of the SREC if any is then recorded to cost of revenue Deferred Investment Tax Credit Revenue We have solar energy systems that are eligible for investment tax credits ITCs that accrue to eligible property under the Internal Revenue Code IRC Under Section 50d5 of the IRC and the related regulations a lessor of qualifying property may elect to treat the lessee as the owner of such property for the purposes of claiming the ITCs associated with such property These regulations enable the ITCs to be separated from the ownership of the property and allow the transfer of the ITCs Under our lease passthrough fund arrangements we can make a tax election to passthrough the ITCs to the investors who are the legal lessee of the property Therefore we are able to monetize these ITCs to the investors who can utilize them in return for cash payments We consider the monetization of ITCs to constitute one of the key elements of realizing the value associated with solar energy systems Consequently we consider the proceeds from the monetization of ITCs to be a component of revenue generated from solar energy systems In accordance with the relevant FASB guidance we recognize revenue from the monetization of ITCs when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the sales price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured An ITC is subject to recapture under the IRC if the underlying solar energy system either ceases to be a qualifying property or undergoes a change in ownership within five years of its placedinservice date the recapture amount decreases on each anniversary of the placedinservice date Since we have an obligation to ensure that the solar energy system is inservice and operational for a term of five years in order to avoid any recapture of the ITC we recognize revenue as the recapture amount decreases assuming the other revenue recognition criteria above have been met As a result the monetized ITC is initially recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets and subsequently onefifth of the monetized ITC is recognized as energy generation and storage revenue on the consolidated statement of operations on each anniversary of the solar energy systems placedinservice date over five years We indemnify the investors for any recapture of ITCs due to our noncompliance We have concluded that the likelihood of a recapture event is remote and consequently we have not recognized a liability for this indemnification on the consolidated balance sheets Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No 201409 Revenue from Contracts with Customers to replace the existing revenue recognition criteria for contracts with customers In August 2015 the FASB issued ASU No 201514 Deferral of the Effective Date to defer the effective date of ASU No 201409 to interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 Subsequently the FASB issued ASU No 201608 Principal versus Agent Considerations ASU No 201610 Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ASU No 201611 Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 201409 and 201416 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3 2016 EITF Meeting ASU No 201612 NarrowScope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU No 201620 Technical Corrections and Improvements to clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No 201409 We will adopt the ASUs on January 1 2018 on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit The adoption of the ASUs will accelerate the revenue recognition of certain vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee which will therefore qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return as opposed to the current accounting as operating leases or collateralized lease borrowings Our interpretation is subject to change as a result of future changes in market conditions incentives or program offerings Upon adoption of the ASUs we currently estimate a decrease to our beginning accumulated deficit in the range of 80 5200 million to 5700 million before income tax effects which are still being assessed including the impact of adjusting deferred revenue for ITC balances as of January 1 2018 We are continuing to assess the impact of adopting the ASUs on the consolidated financial statements and we are continuing to adjust our accounting policies operational and financial reporting processes systems and related internal controls accordingly In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201602 Leases to require lessees to recognize all leases with certain exceptions on the balance sheet while recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to current lease accounting The ASU also eliminates real estatespecific provisions and modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2018 with early adoption permitted We currently expect to adopt the ASU on January 1 2019 We will be required to recognize and measure leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using a modified retrospective approach with certain practical expedients available We intend to elect the available practical expedients upon adoption Upon adoption we expect the consolidated balance sheet to include a right of use asset and liability related to substantially all of our lease arrangements We are continuing to assess the impact of adopting the ASU on our financial position results of operations and related disclosures and have not yet concluded whether the effect on the consolidated financial statements will be material In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201606 Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments to clarify when a contingent put or call option to accelerate the repayment of debt is an embedded derivative The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2016 Adoption of the ASU is modified retrospective We adopted the ASU on January 1 2017 but the ASU did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201609 Improvements to Employee ShareBased Payment Accounting to simplify the accounting for the income tax effects from sharebased compensation the accounting for forfeitures and the accounting for statutory income tax withholding among others In particular the ASU requires all income tax effects from sharebased compensation to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations when the awards vest or are settled the ASU permits accounting for forfeitures as they occur and the ASU permits a higher level of statutory income tax withholding without triggering liability accounting Adoption of the ASU is modified retrospective retrospective and prospective depending on the specific provision being adopted We adopted the ASU on January 1 2017 which increased our beginning accumulated deficit and additional paidin capital by 157 million Furthermore our gross US deferred tax assets increased by 9091 million which was fully offset by a corresponding increase to our valuation allowance upon adoption In addition beginning on January 1 2017 we account for forfeitures as they occur In August 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201615 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments to reduce the diversity in practice with respect to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 Adoption of the ASU is retrospective We will adopt the ASU on January 1 2018 which will impact the classifications within the consolidated statement of cash flows In October 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201616 IntraEntity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory to require the recognition of the income tax effects from an intraentity transfer of an asset other than inventory The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 Adoption of the ASU is modified retrospective We early adopted the ASU on January 1 2017 Our adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements In November 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201618 Statement of Cash Flows Restricted Cash which requires entities to present the aggregate changes in cash cash equivalents restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows As a result the statement of cash flows will be required to present restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as a part of the beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 Adoption of the ASU is retrospective We will adopt the ASU on January 1 2018 which will result in restricted cash being combined with unrestricted cash reconciling beginning and ending balances In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 201701 Clarifying the Definition of a Business to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of assisting entities with evaluating whether transactions should be 81 accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 Adoption of the ASU is prospective We will adopt the ASU on January 1 2018 which we anticipate will result in more transactions being accounted for as asset acquisitions rather than business acquisitions In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 201704 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 An entity will therefore perform the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2019 with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1 2017 Adoption of the ASU is prospective We have not yet selected an adoption date and the ASU currently has an undetermined impact on the consolidated financial statements In May 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 201709 Scope of Modification Accounting to provide guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a sharebased payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 Adoption of the ASU is prospective We will adopt the ASU on January 1 2018 which will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption In August 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 201712 Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities to simplify the application of current hedge accounting guidance The ASU expands and refines hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2018 with early adoption permitted Adoption of the ASU is generally modified retrospective We are currently obtaining an understanding of the ASU and plan to adopt the ASU on January 1 2019 Note 3 Business Combinations Grohmann Acquisition On January 3 2017 we completed our acquisition of Grohmann Engineering GmbH now Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH or Grohmann which specializes in the design development and sale of automated manufacturing systems for 1095 million in cash We acquired Grohmann to improve the speed and efficiency of our manufacturing processes At the time of acquisition we entered into an incentive compensation arrangement for up to a maximum of 258 million of payments contingent upon continued service with us for 36 months after the acquisition date Such payments would have been accounted for as compensation expense in the periods earned However during the three months ended March 31 2017 we terminated the incentive compensation arrangement and accelerated the payments thereunder As a result we recorded the entire 258 million as compensation expense in the three months ended March 31 2017 which was included within selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives and the expected future cash flows and related discount rates can materiality impact our results of operations Significant inputs used included the amount of cash flows the expected period of the cash flows and the discount rates During the fourth quarter of 2017 we finalized our estimate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed Prior to finalization there were no changes to the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 82 The allocation of the purchase consideration wa s based on managements

Total purchase price 109481 Goodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and was primarily attributable to the expected synergies from potential monetization opportunities and from integrating Grohmanns technology into our automotive business as well as the acquired talent Goodwill is not deductible for US income tax purposes and is not amortized Rather we assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired by comparing its carrying

completed our acquisition of SolarCity Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger the Merger Agreement each issued and outstanding share of SolarCity common stock was converted into 0110 the Exchange Ratio shares of our common stock In addition SolarCitys stock option awards and restricted stock unit awards were assumed by us and converted into corresponding equity awards in respect of our common stock based on the Exchange Ratio with the awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the acquisition 83 Fair Value of Purchase

unvested SolarCity awards of 959 million are recognized as stockbased compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period Per ASC 805 the replacement of stock options or other sharebased payment awards in conjunction with a business combination represents a modification of sharebased payment awards that must be accounted for in accordance with ASC 718 Stock Compensation As a result of our issuance of replacement awards a portion of the fairvaluebased measure of the replacement awards is included in the purchase consideration To determine the portion of the replacement awards that is part of the purchase consideration we measured the fair value of both the replacement awards and the historical awards as of the Acquisition Date The fair value of the replacement awards whether vested or unvested was included in the purchase consideration to the extent that preacquisition services were rendered Transaction costs of 217 million were expensed as incurred to selling general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as

operations During the fourth quarter of 2017 we finalized our estimate of the Acquisition Date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed Prior to finalization during the year ended December 31 2017 we recorded an 116 million measurement period adjustment to MyPower customer notes receivable net of current portion and a 462 million measurement period adjustment to accrued

SolarCity is accounted for as an indefinitelived asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts If the research and development efforts are successfully completed and commercial feasibility is reached the IPRD would be amortized over its then estimated useful life If the research and development efforts are not completed or are abandoned the IPRD might be impaired The fair value of the IPRD was estimated using the replacement cost method under the cost approach based on the historical acquisition costs and expenses of the technology adjusted for estimated developers profit opportunity cost and obsolescence factor We expect to complete the research and development efforts in the first half of 2018 but there can be no assurance that the commercial feasibility will be achieved The nature of the research and development efforts consists principally of planning designing and testing the technology for viability in manufacturing solar cells and modules If commercial feasibility is not achieved we would likely look to other alternative technologies Total future amortization expense for intangible assets was estimated as follows in thousands December 31 2017 2018 46897 2019 44706 2020 27284 2021 27284 2022 27282 Thereafter 101217 Total 274670 Note 5 Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements states that fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants As such fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability The threetiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value is comprised of Level I observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets Level II inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and Level III unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows in thousands December 31 2017 December 31 2016 Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Money market funds 2163459 2163459 2226322 2226322 Interest rate swaps net 59 59 1490 1490 Total 2163518 2163459 59 2227812 2226322 1490 All of our cash equivalents were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets Our interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using alternative pricing sources or models that utilized market observable inputs including current and forward interest rates During the years ended December 31 2017 and 2016 there were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy Cash Flow Hedges In November 2015 we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in Japanese yen The derivative instruments that we used were foreign currency forward contracts which were designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 months or less We did not enter into any derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 87 We documented each hedging relationship and assessed its initial effectiveness on each inception date We measured its subsequent effectiveness on a quarterly basis using regression analysis During the term of each effective hedge contract we recorded gains and losses to accumulated other comprehensive income loss We reclassified these gains and losses to cost of automotive sales revenue when the related finished goods inventory was sold or to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the depreciation period when the related finished goods inventory was leased All of our hedge contracts were effective and we recorded no amounts related to hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31 2017 2016 and 2015 No hedge contracts were outstanding as of December 31 2016 or thereafter The net gain of 56 million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of December 31 2016 was fully reclassified to the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31 2017 During the year ended December 31 2016 we reclassified 449 million of net gains from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the consolidated statement of operations No amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31 2015 Interest Rate Swaps We enter into fixedforfloating interest rate swap agreements to swap variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments as required by certain of our lenders We do not designate our interest rate swaps as hedging instruments Accordingly our interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets within other assets or other longterm liabilities with any changes in their fair values recognized as other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations and with any cash flows recognized as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows As of December 31 2016 the aggregate notional amount of our interest rate swaps their gross asset at fair value and their gross liability at fair value were 7896 million 106 million and 121 million respectively During the year ended December 31 2016 we recognized 70 million of gains related to our interest rate swaps Our interest rate swaps outstanding were as follows as of December 31 2017 in thousands Aggregate Notional Amount Gross Asset at Fair

shares of our common stock which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of 12452 per share subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events Holders of the 2018 Notes may convert at their option on or after March 1 2018 Further holders of the 2018 Notes may convert at their option prior to March 1 2018 only under the following circumstances 1 during any quarter beginning after September 30 2013 if the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price 2 during the fivebusiness day period following any fiveconsecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the 2018 Notes is less than 98 of the product of the closing price of our common stock for each day during such fiveconsecutive trading day period or 3 if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if

sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2018 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from 12452 to 18448 per share As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders equity and are not accounted for as derivatives The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paidin capital on the consolidated balance sheet In the second quarter of 2017 1448 million in

amount of 275 Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1 2018 in a public offering 96 Each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 17838 shares of our common stock which is equivalent to a conversion price of 56064 per share subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to dividends tender offers or exchange offers Holders of the convertible senior notes may convert at their option at any time up to and including the second trading day prior to the maturity date If certain events that would constitute a makewhole fundamental change such as significant changes in ownership corporate structure or tradability of our common stock occur prior to the maturity date we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its convertible senior notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances The maximum conversion rate is capped at 23635 shares for each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of 42310 per share The convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option The convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes 1625 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 In September 2014 SolarCity issued 5000 million and in

notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes In connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in September and October 2014 SolarCity entered into capped call option agreements to reduce the potential dilution upon the conversion of the convertible senior notes Specifically upon the exercise of the capped call options we would now receive shares of our common stock equal to 745377 shares multiplied by a i the lower of 114618 or the then market price of our common stock less ii 75936 and divided by b the then market price of our common stock The results of this formula are that we would receive more shares as the market price of our common stock exceeds 75936 and approaches 114618 but we would receive less shares as the market price of our common stock exceeds 114618 Consequently if the convertible senior notes are converted then the number of shares to be issued by us would be effectively partially offset by the shares received by us under the capped call options We can also elect to receive the equivalent value of cash in lieu of shares The capped call options expire on various dates ranging from September 4 2019 to October 29 2019 and the formula above would be adjusted in the event of a merger a tender offer nationalization insolvency delisting of our common stock changes in law failure to deliver insolvency filing stock splits combinations dividends repurchases or similar events or an announcement of certain of the preceding actions Although intended to reduce the net number of shares issued after a conversion of the convertible senior notes the capped call options were separately negotiated transactions are not a part of the terms of the convertible senior notes do not affect the rights of the convertible senior note holders and take effect regardless of whether the convertible senior notes are actually converted The capped call options meet the criteria for equity classification because they are indexed to our common stock and we always control whether settlement will be in shares or cash ZeroCoupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020 In December 2015 SolarCity issued 1130 million in aggregate

passthrough arrangement after payment of the principal and interest on the Solar Assetbacked Notes and expenses related to the assets and the Solar Assetbacked Notes this was contractually documented as a right to participate in the future cash flows of the SPE participation interest The participation interest was recorded as a component of other longterm liabilities for the noncurrent portion and accrued liabilities for the current portion We account for the participation interest as a liability because the investor has no voting or management rights in the SPE the participation interest would terminate upon the investor achieving a specified return and the investor has the option to put the participation interest to us on August 3 2021 for the amount necessary for the investor to achieve the specified return which would require us to settle the participation interest in cash In addition under the terms of the participation interest we have the option to purchase the participation interest from the investor for the amount necessary for the investor to achieve the specified return Solar Assetbacked Notes 20141 In April 2014 SolarCity pooled and transferred qualifying solar

we issued 34772 shares of our common stock as part of the purchase consideration for an acquisition Note 15 Equity Incentive Plans In 2010 we adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan the 2010 Plan The 2010 Plan provides for the granting of stock options RSUs and stock purchase rights to our employees directors and consultants Stock options granted under the 2010 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees Nonqualified stock options may be granted to our employees directors and consultants Generally our stock options and RSUs vest over up to four years and are exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates Vesting typically terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends In addition as a result of our acquisition of SolarCity we assumed its equity award plans and its outstanding equity awards as of the Acquisition Date SolarCitys outstanding equity awards were converted into equity awards to acquire our common stock in share amounts and prices based on the Exchange Ratio with the equity awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and

the fair value method we estimate the fair value of each stock option award and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the BlackScholes option pricing model and the weightedaverage assumptions in the following table Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 Riskfree interest rate Stock options 18 15 16 ESPP 11 06 03 Expected term in years Stock options 51 62 54 ESPP 05 05 05 Expected volatility

measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock The riskfree interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield for zerocoupon US Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grants expected life Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017 given our then limited history with employee grants we used the simplified method in estimating the expected term of our employee grants the simplified method utilizes the average of the timetovesting and the contractual life of the employee grant Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017 we use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock 104 2014 PerformanceBased Stock Option Awards In 2014 to create incentives for continued longterm success beyond the Model S program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders interests in the achievement of significant milestones by us the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted stock option awards to certain employees excluding our

3646 27832 2172 Total provision for income taxes 31546 26698 13039 On December 22 2017 the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act was enacted into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code Changes include but are not limited to a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after December 31 2017 the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as remeasuring our US deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net US deferred tax assets In December 2017 the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act SAB 118 which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date Since the Tax Act was enacted late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations are expected over the next 12 months we consider the accounting of deferred tax remeasurements and other items such as state tax considerations to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final yearend data and tax positions We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118 We do not expect any subsequent adjustments to have any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net US deferred tax assets 107 Deferred tax assets liabilities as of December 31 2017 and 2016 consisted of the following in thousands December 31 December 31 2017 2016 Deferred tax

Instruments 22033 Total deferred tax liabilities 556347 705781 Deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities 23609 25682 As of December 31 2017 we recorded a valuation allowance of 184 billion for the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized The valuation on our net deferred taxes increased by 8210 million during the year ended December 31 2017 The valuation allowance increase is primarily due to additional US deferred tax assets incurred in the current year as well as an increase relating to adoption of ASU 201609 and offset by the remeasurement of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 from 35 to the new 21 tax rate Management believes that based on the available information it is more likely than not that the US deferred tax assets will not be realized such that a full valuation allowance is required against all US deferred tax assets We have net 465 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions which management believes are morelikelythannot to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions 108 The r econciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 2017 2016 and 2015 was as follows in thousands Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 Tax at statutory federal rate

the adoption of ASU No 201609 Improvements to Employee Sharebased Payment Accounting excess tax benefits from sharebased award activity incurred from the prior and current years are reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes The excess tax benefits result in an increase to our gross US deferred tax assets that is offset by a corresponding increase to our valuation allowance 2 Due to the Tax Act our US deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 2017 were remeasured from 35 to 21 The change in tax rate resulted in a decrease to our gross US deferred tax assets which is offset by a corresponding decrease to our valuation allowance As of December 31 2017 we had 642 billion of federal and 526 billion of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 2028 for state purposes A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity prior to our acquisition in 2016 and therefore are subject to change of control provisions which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year We do not expect these change of control limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes Upon the adoption of ASU 201609 our gross US deferred tax assets increased by 5834 million inclusive of the effect for the US statutory corporate tax rate reduction from 35 to 21 and is fully offset by a corresponding increase to our valuation allowance As of December 31 2017 we had research and development tax credits of 2090 million and 2232 million for federal and state income tax purposes respectively If not utilized the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024 However the state research and development tax credits can be carriedforward indefinitely In addition we had other general business tax credits of 1169 million for federal income tax purposes which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033 Collectively we had no foreign earnings as of December 31 2017 and therefore was not subject to the mandatory repatriation tax provisions of the Tax Act However some of our foreign subsidiaries do have accumulated earnings No deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been recorded relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code We determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to prior ownership changes 109 Uncertain Tax Positions The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows in thousands December 31 2014 41377 Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions 6626 Increases in balances

classified as income tax expense and were immaterial Unrecognized tax benefits of 1910 million if recognized would not affect our effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance We do not anticipate that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months We file income tax returns in the US California and various state and foreign jurisdictions Tax years 2004 to 2016 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes and tax years 2004 to 2016 remain subject to examination for California income tax purposes All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for US federal and California income tax purposes Tax years 2008 to 2016 remain subject to examination in other US state and foreign jurisdictions The US Tax Court issued a decision in Altera Corp v Commissioner related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in a costsharing arrangement As this decision can be overturned upon appeal we have not recorded any impact as of December 31 2017 In addition any potential tax benefits would increase our US deferred tax asset which is currently offset with a full valuation allowance Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies Leases We have entered into various noncancellable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices manufacturing and warehouse facilities retail and service locations equipment vehicles solar energy systems and Supercharger sites

buildtosuit lease arrangement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York the SUNY Foundation where the SUNY Foundation will construct a solar cell and panel manufacturing facility referred to as Gigafactory 2 with our participation in the design and construction install certain utilities and other improvements and acquire certain manufacturing equipment designated by us to be used in the manufacturing facility The SUNY Foundation covers i construction costs related to the manufacturing facility up to 3500 million ii the acquisition and commissioning of the manufacturing equipment in an amount up to 2747 million and iii 1253 million for additional specified scope costs in cases i and ii only subject to the maximum funding allocation from the State of New York and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amounts The SUNY Foundation will own the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment purchased by the SUNY Foundation Following completion of the manufacturing facility we will lease the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment owned by the SUNY Foundation for an initial period of 10 years with an option to renew for 200 per year plus utilities Under the terms of the buildtosuit lease arrangement we are required to achieve specific operational milestones during the initial lease term which include employing a certain number of employees at the manufacturing facility within western New York and within the State of New York within specified periods following the completion of the manufacturing facility We are also required to spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses and other costs in the State of New York within 10 years following the achievement of full production On an annual basis during the initial lease term as measured on each anniversary of the commissioning of the manufacturing facility if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements then we would be obligated to pay a 412 million program payment to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements Furthermore if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us then additional amounts might become payable by us The noncash investing and financing activities related to the arrangement during the year ended December 31 2017 amounted to 861 million The noncash investing and financing activities related to the arrangement from the Acquisition Date through December 31 2016 amounted to 56 million Environmental Liabilities In connection with our factory located in Fremont California we are obligated to pay for the remediation of certain environmental conditions existing at the time we purchased

remediation costs incurred after 10 years from the purchase date NUMMI is responsible for any remediation costs between 150 million and 300 million for up to 10 years after the purchase date 111 Legal Proceedings Proceedings Related to US Treasury In July 2012 SolarCity along with other companies in the solar energy industry received a subpoena from the US Treasury Departments Office of the Inspector General to deliver certain documents in SolarCitys possession that relate to SolarCitys applications for US Treasury grants In February 2013 two financing funds affiliated with SolarCity filed a lawsuit in the US Court of Federal Claims against the US government seeking to recover 140 million that the US Treasury was obligated to pay but failed to pay under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 In February 2016 the US government filed a motion seeking leave to assert a counterclaim against the two plaintiff funds on the grounds that the US government in fact paid them more not less than they were entitled to as a matter of law In September 2017 SolarCity and the US government reached a global settlement of both the investigation and SolarCitys lawsuit In that settlement SolarCity admitted no wrongdoing and agreed to return approximately 5 of the US Treasury cash grants it had received between 2009 and 2013 amounting to 295 million The investigation is now closed and SolarCitys lawsuit has been dismissed Securities Litigation Relating to SolarCitys Financial Statements and Guidance On March 28 2014 a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity and two of its officers The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCitys securities from March 6 2013 to March 18 2014 After a series of amendments to the original complaint the District Court dismissed the amended complaint and entered a judgment in our favor on August 9 2016 The plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal On December 4 2017 the District Court heard oral arguments on the plaintiffs notice of appeal from the dismissal We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit and appeal vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with this lawsuit On August 15 2016 a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity two of its officers and a former officer On March 20 2017 the purported stockholder class filed a consolidated complaint that includes the original matter in the same court against SolarCity one of its officers and three former officers As consolidated the complaint alleges that SolarCity made projections of future sales and installations that it failed to achieve and that these projections were fraudulent when made The suit claimed violations of federal securities laws and sought unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCitys securities from May 6 2015 to May 9 2016 On July 25 2017 the court took SolarCitys fullybriefed motion to dismiss under submission On August 11 2017 the court granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend On September 11 2017 after lead plaintiff determined he would not amend the Court dismissed the action with prejudice and entered judgment in favor of SolarCity and the individual defendants Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition Between September 1 2016 and October 5 2016 seven lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging the SolarCity acquisition Following consolidation the lawsuit names as defendants our board of directors and alleges among other things that they breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks among other relief unspecified monetary damages attorneys fees and costs On January 27 2017 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint Rather than respond to the defendants motion the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint On March 17 2017 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint On December 13 2017 the Court heard oral arguments on the motion and reserved decision The plaintiffs filed a parallel action in the US District Court for the District of Delaware on April 21 2017 adding claims for violations of federal securities laws On February 6 2017 a purported stockholder made a demand to inspect our books and records purportedly to investigate potential breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with the SolarCity acquisition On April 17 2017 the purported stockholder filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the California Superior Court seeking to compel us to provide the documents requested in the demand We filed a demurrer to the writ petition or in the alternative a 112 motion to stay the action On November 9 2017 the Superior C ourt granted our motion and dismissed the action with out prejudice On March 24 2017 another lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the District of Delaware by a purported Tesla stockholder challenging the SolarCity acquisition The complaint alleges among other things that our board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition and alleges violations of federal securities laws We believe that the claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with these lawsuits Securities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles On October 10 2017 a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against us two of our current officers and a former officer The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May 4 2016 to October 6 2017 The lawsuit claims that we supposedly made materially false and misleading statements regarding our preparedness to produce Model 3 vehicles We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with this lawsuit Other Matters From time to time we have received requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the National Transportation Safety Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities If an unfavorable ruling were to occur there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations prospects cash flows financial position and brand Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from reductions in US Treasury grants or ITCs Generally such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy systems as assessed by the US Treasury Department for purposes of claiming US Treasury grants or as assessed by the IRS for purposes of claiming ITCs or US Treasury grants For each balance sheet date we assess and recognize when applicable a distribution payable for the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information available at that time including any guidelines issued by the US Treasury Department on solar energy system valuations for purposes of claiming US Treasury grants and any audits undertaken by the IRS We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us which were immaterial for this obligation are not probable based on the facts known at the filing date The maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the solar energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the values that the US Treasury Department would determine as fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming US Treasury grants or the values the IRS would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs or US Treasury grants We claim US Treasury grants based on guidelines provided by the US Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the IRS We use fair values determined with the assistance of independent thirdparty appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs that are passedthrough to and claimed by the fund investors Since we cannot determine future revisions to US Treasury Department guidelines governing solar energy system values or how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs or US Treasury grants we are unable to reliably estimate the maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this obligation as of each balance sheet date We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation The amount of incentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size andor the amount of solar energy produced We also currently participate in one states incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service State and local 113 incentives received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund We are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received We are contractually obligated to make payments to one fund investor if the fund investor does not achieve a specified minimum internal rate of return The fund investor has already received a significant portion of the projected economic benefits from US Treasury grant distributions and tax depreciation benefits The contractual provisions of the fund state that the fund has an indefinite term unless the members agree to dissolve the fund Based on our current financial projections regarding the amounts and timing of future distributions to the fund investor we do not expect to make any payments as a result of this guarantee and have not accrued any liabilities for this guarantee The amounts of any potential future payments under this guarantee are dependent on the amounts and timing of future distributions to the fund investor future tax benefits that accrue to the fund investor our purchase of the fund investors interest in the fund and future distributions to the fund investor upon the liquidation of the fund Due to the uncertainties surrounding estimating the amounts and timing of these factors we are unable to estimate the maximum potential payments under this guarantee To date the fund investor has achieved the specified minimum internal rate of return Our lease passthrough financing funds have a onetime lease payment reset mechanism that occurs after the installation of all solar energy systems in a fund As a result of this mechanism we may be required to refund master lease prepayments previously received from investors Any refunds of master lease prepayments would reduce the lease passthrough financing obligation Letters of Credit As of December 31 2017 we had 1382 million of unused letters of credit outstanding Note 18 VIE Arrangements We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles In particular our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810 Consolidation We have considered the provisions within the agreements which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs including determining the solar energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs redeploying solar energy systems or vehicles and managing customer receivables We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund net of agreed upon expenses estimated expenses tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements Generally our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investors interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements Pursuant to management services maintenance and warranty arrangements we have been contracted to provide services to the funds such as operations and maintenance support accounting lease servicing and performance reporting In some instances we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements A funds creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds None of the assets of the funds had been pledged as collateral for their obligations 114 The aggregate carrying values of the VIEs assets and liabilities after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows in thousands December 31 2017 December 31 2016 Assets Current assets Cash and cash

82917 Total liabilities 1288742 868342 Note 19 Lease PassThrough Financing Obligation Through December 31 2017 we had entered into eight transactions referred to as lease passthrough fund arrangements Under these arrangements our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors through arrangements contractually structured as master leases for an initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years These solar energy systems are subject to lease or power purchase agreements with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25 years These solar energy systems are included within solar energy systems leased and to be leased net on the consolidated balance sheet The cost of the solar energy systems under lease passthrough fund arrangements as of December 31 2017 and 2016 was 109 billion and 7853 million respectively The accumulated depreciation on these assets as of December 31 2017 and 2016 was 309 million and 21 million respectively The total lease passthrough financing obligation as of December 31 2017 was 1348 million of which 673 million was classified as a current liability The total lease passthrough financing obligation as of December 31 2016 was 1223 million of which 515 million was classified as a current liability Under a lease passthrough fund arrangement the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor which is one of our subsidiaries and in some cases subsequent periodic payments We allocate a portion of the aggregate investor payments to the fair value of the assigned ITCs which is estimated by discounting the projected cash flow impact of the ITCs using a market interest rate and is accounted for separately see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies We account for the remainder of the investor payments as a borrowing by recording the proceeds received as a lease passthrough financing obligation which is repaid from the future customer lease payments and any incentive rebates A portion of the amounts received by the investor is allocated to interest expense using the effective interest rate method 115 The lease passthrough financing obligation is nonrecourse once the associated solar energy systems have been placed inservice and the associated customer arrangements have been assigned to the investors However we are required to comply with certain financial covenants specified in the contractual agreements which we had met as of December 31 201 7 In addition we are responsible for any warranties performance guarantees accounting and performance reporting Furthermore we continue to account for the customer arrangements and any incentive rebates in the consolidated financial statements regardless of whether the cash is received by us or directly by the investors As of December 31 2017 the future minimum master lease payments to be received from investors for each of the next five years and thereafter were as follows in thousands 2018 44771 2019 44973 2020 43930 2021 42731 2022 34631 Thereafter 543512 Total 754548 For two of the lease passthrough fund arrangements our subsidiaries have pledged its assets to the investors as security for its obligations under the contractual agreements Each lease passthrough fund arrangement has a onetime master lease prepayment adjustment mechanism that occurs when the capacity and the placedinservice dates of the associated solar energy systems are finalized or on an agreedupon date As part of this mechanism the master lease prepayment amount is updated and we may be obligated to refund a portion of a master lease prepayment or entitled to receive an additional master lease prepayment Any additional master lease prepayments are recorded as an additional lease passthrough financing obligation while any master lease prepayment refunds would reduce the lease passthrough financing obligation Note 20 Defined Contribution Plan We have a 401k savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code Under the 401k savings plan participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100 of their eligible compensation subject to certain limitations Participants are fully vested in their contributions We did not make any contributions to the 401k savings plan during the years ended December 31 2017 2016 and 2015 Note 21 Related Party Transactions
