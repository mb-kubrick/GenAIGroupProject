new version of the Tesla Roadster We have started to accept reservations for the Tesla Semi truck and the new Tesla Roadster Energy Storage Using the energy management technologies and manufacturing processes developed for our vehicle powertrain systems we developed energy storage products for use in homes commercial facilities and on the utility grid Advances in battery architecture thermal management and power electronics that were originally commercialized in our vehicles are now being leveraged in our energy storage products Our energy storage systems are used for numerous applications including backup power grid independence peak demand reduction demand response reducing intermittency of renewable generation replacement of fossil fuel generation and wholesale electric market services Our energy product portfolio includes systems with a wide range of applications from residential to large gridscale projects Powerwall 2 is a 14 kWh rechargeable lithiumion battery designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility and can be used to provide seamless backup power in a grid outage and to maximize selfconsumption of solar power generation In addition we offer the Powerpack 2 system a fully integrated energy storage solution comprised of up to 210kWh AC battery packs and up to 650 kVa at 480V inverters that can be grouped together to form megawatt hour MWh and gigawatt hour GWh sized installations The Powerpack 2 system can be used by commercial and industrial customers for peak shaving load shifting selfconsumption of solar generation and demand response as well as to provide backup power during grid outages and by utilities and independent power producers to smooth and firm the output of renewable power generation sources provide dynamic energy capacity to the grid defer or eliminate the need to upgrade transmission or distribution infrastructure and provide a variety of other grid services such as frequency regulation and voltage control Powerpack 2 can also be combined with renewable energy generation sources to create microgrids that provide communities with clean resilient and affordable power Along with designing and manufacturing energy storage products we continue to develop and advance our software capabilities for the control and optimal dispatch of energy storage systems across a wide range of markets and applications Solar Energy Systems The major components of our solar energy systems include solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical current inverters that convert the electrical output from the panels to a usable current compatible with the electric grid racking that attaches the solar panels to the roof or ground electrical hardware that connects the solar energy system to the electric grid and our monitoring device While we have recently started manufacturing solar panels at Gigafactory 2 in collaboration with Panasonic we currently purchase the majority of system components from vendors maintaining multiple sources for each major component to ensure competitive pricing and an adequate supply of materials We also design and manufacture other system components The residential solar energy systems that we sell enable our customers to take direct advantage of federal tax credits to reduce their electricity costs Our solar loan offering enables customers to own their solar energy systems with little upfront cost We also continue to offer lease and power purchase agreement PPA options to both residential and commercial customers Our current standard leases and PPAs have a 20year term and we typically offer customers the opportunity to renew their agreements In October 2016 we unveiled Solar Roof which integrates solar energy production with aesthetically pleasing and durable glass roofing tiles and is designed to complement the architecture of homes and commercial buildings while turning sunlight into electricity We have been installing this product at a slow pace to gather learnings about our design and installation processes and plan to ramp the production of Solar Roof with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities during 2019 3 Technology Vehicles Our core competencies are powertrain engineering vehicle engineering innovative manufacturing and energy storage Our core intellectual property includes our electric powertrain our ability to design vehicles that utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain and our development of selfdriving technologies Our powertrain consists of our battery pack power electronics motor gearbox and control software We offer several powertrain variants for our vehicles that incorporate years of research and development In addition we have designed our vehicles to incorporate the latest advances in consumer technologies such as mobile computing sensing displays and connectivity Battery Pack We design our battery packs to achieve high energy density at a low cost while also maintaining safety reliability and long life Our proprietary technology includes systems for high density energy storage cooling safety charge balancing structural durability and electronics management We have also pioneered advanced manufacturing techniques to manufacture large volumes of battery packs with high quality at low cost We have significant expertise in the safety and management systems needed to use lithiumion cells in the automotive environment and have further optimized cell designs to increase overall performance These advancements have enabled us to improve over time the cost and performance of our batteries Our engineering and manufacturing efforts have been performed with a longerterm goal of building a foundation for further development For instance we have designed our battery pack to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry and form factor We maintain extensive testing and RD capabilities at the individual cell level the full batterypack level and on other critical battery pack systems and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithiumion cell vendors chemistry types and performance characteristics We believe that the flexibility of our designs combined with our research and realworld performance data will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells and optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles Power Electronics The power electronics in our electric vehicle powertrain govern the flow of high voltage electrical current throughout our vehicles and serve to power our electric motor to generate torque while driving and deliver energy into the battery pack while charging The drive inverter converts direct current from the battery pack into alternating current to drive our induction and permanent magnet motors and provides regenerative braking functionality which captures energy from the wheels to charge the battery pack The primary technological advantages to our designs include the ability to drive large amounts of current in a small physical package with high efficiency and low cost The charger charges the battery pack by converting alternating current usually from a wall outlet or other electricity source into direct current that can be accepted by the battery Tesla vehicles can recharge on a wide variety of electricity sources due to the design of this charger from a common household outlet to high power circuits meant for more industrial uses Dual Motor Powertrain We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an allwheel drive configuration Teslas dual motor powertrain digitally and independently controls torque to the front and rear wheels The nearinstantaneous response of the motors combined with low centers of gravity provides drivers with controlled performance and increased traction control 4 Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software There are numerous processors in our vehicles to control these functions and we write custom firmware for many of these processors Software algorithms control traction vehicle stability the acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle climate control and thermal management and are also used extensively to monitor the charge state of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems Drivers use the information and control systems in our vehicles to optimize performance customize vehicle behavior manage charging modes and times and control all infotainment functions We develop almost all of this software including most of the user interfaces internally SelfDriving Development We have expertise in developing selfdriving systems and currently offer in our vehicles an advanced driver assist system that we refer to as Autopilot including autosteering traffic aware cruise control automated lane changing automated parking Summon and driver warning systems In October 2016 we began equipping all Tesla vehicles with hardware needed for full selfdriving capability including cameras that provide 360 degree visibility updated ultrasonic sensors for object detection a forwardfacing radar with enhanced processing and a powerful new onboard computer Our Autopilot systems relieve our drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel Although at present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle our system provides safety and convenience functionality that allows our customers to rely on it much like the system that airplane pilots use when conditions permit This hardware suite along with overtheair firmware updates and field data feedback loops from the onboard camera radar ultrasonics and GPS enables the system to continually learn and improve its performance Additionally we continue to make significant advancements in the development of fully selfdriving technologies Energy Storage We are leveraging many of the componentlevel technologies from our vehicles to advance our energy storage products including high density energy storage cooling safety charge balancing structural durability and electronics management By taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems we are able to maximize manufacturing

battery systems seamlessly with global electricity grids while providing fastacting systems for power injection and absorption Solar Energy Systems We are continually innovating and developing new technologies to facilitate the growth of our solar energy systems business For example Solar Roof is being designed to work seamlessly with Tesla Powerwall 2 and we have developed proprietary software to reduce system design and installation timelines and costs Design and Engineering Vehicles In addition to the design development and production of the powertrain we have created significant inhouse capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems We design and engineer bodies chassis interiors heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems inhouse and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers Our team has core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which reduces the product development time of new models 5 Additionally our team has expertise in lightweight materials a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range Model S and Model X are built with a lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporate a variety of materials and production methods that help optimize the weight of the vehicle Moreover we have designed Model 3 with a mix of materials to be lightweight and safe while also increasing costeffectiveness for this massmarket vehicle We are designing Model Y on the Model 3 platform and expect that Model Y will share about 75 of its components with Model 3 which we expect will reduce the cost and time to ramp production of Model Y Energy Storage We have an inhouse engineering team that both designs our energy storage products themselves and works with our residential commercial and utility customers to design bespoke systems incorporating our products Our teams expertise in electrical mechanical civil and software engineering enables us to create integrated energy storage solutions that meet the particular needs of all customer types Solar Energy Systems We also have an inhouse engineering team that designs a customized solar energy system or Solar Roof for each of our customers and which works closely with our energy storage engineering teams to integrate an energy storage system when requested by the customer We have developed software that simplifies and expedites the design process and optimizes the design to maximize the energy production of each system Our engineers complete a structural analysis of each building and produce a full set of structural design and electrical blueprints that contain the specifications for all system components Additionally we design complementary mounting and grounding hardware where required Sales and Marketing Vehicles CompanyOwned Stores and Galleries We market and sell our vehicles directly to consumers through an international network of companyowned stores and galleries which we believe enables us to better control costs of inventory manage warranty service and pricing maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback Our Tesla stores and galleries are highly visible premium outlets in major metropolitan markets some of which combine retail sales and service We have also found that opening a service center

European headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in Amsterdam and Tilburg Our operations in Tilburg include final assembly testing and quality control for Model S and Model X vehicles delivered within the European Union a parts distribution warehouse for service centers throughout Europe a center for remanufacturing work and a customer service center Gigafactory 1 outside of Reno Nevada Gigafactory 1 is a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate battery material cell module and battery pack production in one location We use the battery packs manufactured at Gigafactory 1 for our vehicles including Model 3 and energy storage products We also manufacture Model 3 drive units at Gigafactory 1 9 Gigafactory 1 is being built in phases Tesla Panasonic and other partners are currently manufacturing inside the finished sections Our present plan is to continue expanding Gigafactory 1 over the next few years so that its capacity significantly exceeds the approximately 500000 vehicle per year capacity that we announced when we first started developing it and we have additionally added capacity for manufacturing our energy storage products We have also announced that we will likely manufacture Model Y which we intend to produce at high volumes by the end of 2020 at Gigafactory 1 We believe that Gigafactory 1 will allow us to achieve a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs with our volume production of Model 3 We have an agreement with Panasonic to partner with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in production equipment that it is using to manufacture and supply us with battery cells Through our ownership of Gigafactory 1 and our partnership with Panasonic we own sole access to a facility designed to be the highestvolume and lowestcost source of lithiumion batteries in the world Gigafactory Shanghai We are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai in order to significantly increase the affordability of Model 3 for customers in China by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating certain tariffs on vehicles imported from the US We broke ground in January 2019 and subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online we expect to begin production of certain trims of Model 3 at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019 We expect much of the investment in Gigafactory Shanghai to be provided through local debt financing supported by limited direct capital expenditures by us Moreover we are targeting the capital expenditures per unit of production capacity at this factory to be less than that of our Model 3 production at the Tesla Factory from which we have drawn learnings that should allow us to simplify our manufacturing layout and processes at Gigafactory Shanghai Supply Chain Our vehicles use thousands of purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of suppliers We have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain other key system parts While we obtain components from multiple sources in some cases similar to other automobile manufacturers many of the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source In addition while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for our battery packs are available we have currently fully qualified only one cell supplier for the battery packs we use in our production vehicles We are working to fully qualify additional cells from other manufacturers We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum steel cobalt lithium nickel and copper The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials We believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements Energy Storage Our energy storage products are manufactured at Gigafactory 1 We leverage the same supply chain process and infrastructure as we use for our vehicles The battery architecture and many of the components used in our energy storage products are the same or similar to those used in our vehicles battery pack enabling us to take advantage of manufacturing efficiencies and supply chain economies of scale The power electronics and inverters for the Powerwall and Powerpack systems are also manufactured at Gigafactory 1 allowing us to ship deploymentready systems directly to customers 10 Solar Energy Systems We currently purchase major components such as solar panels and inverters directly from multiple manufacturers We typically purchase solar panels and inverters on an asneeded basis from our suppliers at thenprevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued under our master contractual arrangements In December 2016 we entered into a longterm agreement with Panasonic to manufacture photovoltaic PV cells and modules with negotiated pricing provisions at our Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo New York with the intended capacity to manufacture at least 10 gigawatt GW of solar products annually We have recently started manufacturing solar panels at this facility in collaboration with Panasonic Governmental Programs Incentives and Regulations Vehicles California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives We have entered into multiple agreements over the past few years with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority CAEATFA that provide multiyear sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes including the expansion and ongoing development of Model S Model X Model 3 and future electric vehicles and the expansion of electric vehicle powertrain production in California Nevada Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory 1 we have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for sales use real property personal property and employer excise taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits These incentives are available for the applicable periods beginning on October 17 2014 and ending on either June 30 2024 or June 30 2034 depending on the incentive Under these agreements we were eligible for a maximum of 1950 million of transferable tax credits subject to capital investments by us and our partners for Gigafactory 1 of at least 350 billion which we exceeded during 2017 and specified hiring targets for Gigafactory 1 which we exceeded during 2018 As a result as of December 31 2018 we had earned the maximum amount of credits Tesla Regulatory Credits In connection with the production delivery placement into service and ongoing operation of our zero emission vehicles charging infrastructure and solar systems in global markets we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credits We have sold these credits and will continue to sell future credits to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements For example under Californias Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation and those of states that have adopted Californias standard vehicle manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits referred to as ZEV credits for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements These laws provide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their excess credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those laws Tesla also earns other types of salable regulatory credits in the United States and abroad including greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuels credits Likewise several US states have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production These requirements enable companies deploying solar energy to earn tradable credits known as Solar Renewable Energy Certificates SRECs RegulationVehicle Safety and Testing Our vehicles are subject to and comply with or are otherwise exempt from numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA including all applicable United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards FMVSS Our vehicles fully comply with all applicable FMVSSs without the need for any exemptions and we expect future Tesla vehicles to either fully comply or comply with limited exemptions related to new technologies Additionally there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSS and while we anticipate compliance there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted 11 As a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS as well as the NHTSA bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles can be imported or sold in the US Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness requirements crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA including the CAFE standards Theft Prevention Act requirements consumer information labeling requirements Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owners manual requirements The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturers suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing In addition this law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings as determined by EPA as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA if such tests are conducted Our vehicles sold outside of the US are subject to similar foreign safety environmental and other regulations Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the US and may require redesign andor retesting The European Union has established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that are scheduled to commence in 2020 and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the United Kingdoms impending withdrawal from the European Union These changes could impact the rollout of new vehicle features in Europe Regulation Self Driving There are no federal US regulations pertaining to the safety of selfdriving vehicles however NHTSA has established recommended guidelines Certain US states have legal restrictions on selfdriving vehicles and many other states are considering them This patchwork increases the legal complexity for our vehicles In Europe certain vehicle safety regulations apply to selfdriving braking and steering systems and certain treaties also restrict the legality of certain higher levels of selfdriving vehicles Selfdriving laws and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the US and foreign countries and may create restrictions on selfdriving features that we develop RegulationBattery Safety and Testing Our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of dangerous goods defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation such as by ocean vessel rail truck or air We have completed the applicable transportation tests for our battery packs demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulations We use lithiumion cells in our high voltage battery packs The use storage and disposal of our battery packs is regulated under federal law We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation State laws regulate the manufacture distribution and sale of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state As we open additional Tesla stores and service centers we secure dealer licenses or their equivalent and engage in sales activities to sell our vehicles directly to consumers A few states such as Michigan and Connecticut do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or otherwise restrict a manufacturers ability to deliver or service vehicles To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we generally conduct the sale out of the state via the Internet phone or mail In such states we have opened galleries that serve an educational purpose and are not sales locations As we expand our retail footprint in the US some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations We expect that the dealer associations will continue to mount challenges to our business model In addition we expect the dealer associations to actively lobby state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to Teslas ownership and operation of its own retail and service locations and we intend to actively fight any such efforts to limit our ability to sell our own vehicles 12 Energy Storage The regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development Nevertheless there are various policies incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage For example energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the 30 tax credit under Section 48a3 of the Internal Revenue Code or the IRC as described below In addition California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage and behind the meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets In 2011 and 2013 FERC removed many barriers for systems like energy storage to provide frequency regulation service thus increasing the value these systems can obtain in wholesale energy markets More recently in late 2016 FERC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that if it becomes a final rule would further break down barriers preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy markets Finally in January 2017 FERC issued a statement supporting the use of energy storage as both electric transmission and as electric generation concurrently thus enabling energy storage systems to provide greater value to the electric grid Solar Energy Systems Government and Utility Programs and Incentives US federal state and local governments have established various policies incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy These incentives include tax credits cash grants tax abatements and rebates The federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit ITC under two sections of the IRC Section 48 and Section 25D Section 48a3 of the IRC allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 30 of qualified expenditures for a commercial solar energy system that commences construction by December 31 2019 The credit then declines to 26 in 2020 22 in 2021 and a permanent 10 thereafter We claim the Section 48 commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial projects based on ownership of the solar energy system The federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible commercial solar energy systems Section 25D of the IRC allows a homeownertaxpayer to claim a credit of 30 of qualified expenditures for a residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by December 31 2019 The credit then declines to 26 in 2020 and 22 in 2021 and is scheduled to expire thereafter Customers who purchase their solar energy systems for cash or through our solar loan offering are eligible to claim the Section 25D investment tax credit In addition to the federal ITC many US states offer personal and corporate tax credits and incentives for solar energy systems Regulation General We are not a regulated utility in the US To operate our systems we obtain interconnection agreements from the utilities In most cases interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been preapproved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body Sales of electricity and nonsale equipment leases by third parties such as our leases and PPAs face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions Regulation Net Metering Most states in the US have a regulatory policy known as net energy metering or net metering available to solar customers Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their onsite solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid In certain jurisdictions regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so 13 Regulation Mandated Renewable Capacity Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production such as an enforceable renewable portfolio standard or RPS or other policies that require covered entities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources such as solar energy systems In SREC state markets the RPS requires electricity suppliers to secure a portion of their electricity from solar generators The SREC program provides a means for SRECs to be created A SREC represents the renewable energy associated with 1000 kWhs of electricity produced from a solar energy system When a solar energy system generates 1000 kWhs of electricity one SREC is issued by a government agency which can then be sold separately from the energy produced to covered entities who surrender the SRECs to the state to prove compliance with the states renewable energy mandate Competition Vehicles The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader crosssection of the passenger and commercial vehicle market We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology For example Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 competes with small to mediumsized sedans which are extremely competitive markets with internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers Moreover many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market Overall we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicles particularly those fueled by electricity relative to the internal combustion vehicle Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles Electric vehicles have also already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the US market as well In addition several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles including plugin versions Energy Storage The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive Established companies such as AES Energy Storage Siemens LG Chem and Samsung as well as various emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio There are several companies providing individual components of energy storage systems such as cells battery modules and power electronics as well as others providing integrated systems We compete with these companies based on price energy density and efficiency We believe that the specifications of our products our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our Powerpack 2 product give us a competitive advantage when marketing our products Solar Energy Systems The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price predictability of price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems while others only provide financing for these installations In the residential solar energy system installation market our primary competitors include Vivint Solar Inc Sunrun Inc Trinity Solar SunPower Corporation and many smaller local solar companies 14 Intellectual Property As part of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights such as with respect to patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets including through employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements Additionally we previously announced a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world Segment Information We operate as two reportable segments automotive and energy generation and storage The automotive segment includes the design development manufacturing sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits Additionally the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other which includes nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers retail merchandise and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers The energy generation and storage segment includes the design manufacture installation and sale or leasing of stationary energy storage products and solar energy systems and sale of electricity generated by our solar energy systems to customers Employees As of December 31 2018 Tesla Inc had 48817 fulltime employees To date we have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good Available Information We file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto including our Annual Reports on Form 10K our Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q and Current Reports on Form 8K proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC In addition the SEC maintains a website wwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically Our website is located at wwwteslacom and our reports amendments thereto proxy statements and other information are also made available free of charge on our investor relations website at irteslacom as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such information with the SEC The information posted on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10K 15 ITEM 1A RI SK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results Risks Related to Our Business and Industry We have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delays or other complications in the design manufacture launch production delivery and servicing ramp of new vehicles and other products such as Model 3 Model Y our energy storage products and Solar Roof which could harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results We have previously experienced launch manufacturing production and delivery ramp delays or other complications in connection with new vehicle models such as Model S Model X and Model 3 new vehicle features such as the allwheel drive dual motor drivetrain on Model S and the second version of Autopilot hardware and a significant increase in automation introduced in the manufacture of Model 3 For example we encountered unanticipated challenges such as certain supply chain constraints that led to initial delays in producing Model X Similarly we experienced certain challenges in the production of Model 3 that led to delays in its ramp Moreover in the areas of Model 3 production where we had challenges ramping fully automated processes such as portions of the battery module assembly line material flow system and the general assembly line we reduced the levels of automation and introduced semiautomated or manual processes If issues like these arise or recur if our remediation measures and process changes do not continue to be successful if we experience issues with transitioning to full automation in certain production lines or to other planned manufacturing improvements or if we experience issues or delays in building our Gigafactory Shanghai in China or commencing and ramping Model 3 production there we could experience issues in sustaining the Model 3 ramp or delays in increasing Model 3 production further Also if we encounter difficulties in scaling our delivery or servicing capabilities for Model 3 or future vehicles and products to high volumes in the US or internationally our financial condition and operating results could suffer In addition because our vehicle models share certain production facilities with other vehicle models the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact the production of other models or lead to bottlenecks that impact the production of all models We may also experience similar future delays or other complications in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicles such as Model Y the Tesla Semi our planned pickup truck and new Tesla Roadster our energy storage products and Solar Roof Any significant additional delay or other complication in the production of and delivery capabilities for our current products or the development manufacture launch production and delivery and servicing capability ramp of our future products including complications associated with expanding our production capacity supply chain and delivery systems or obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals could materially damage our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results We have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delays in realizing our projected timelines and cost and volume targets for the production and ramp of Model 3 which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results Our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to manufacture market and sell the Model 3 vehicle which we are offering at a lower price point and which we are producing at significantly higher volumes than the Model S or Model X vehicles We commenced production and initial customer deliveries of Model 3 in July 2017 and since then have achieved a stabilized production rate At the Tesla Factory we expect to continue to increase our Model 3 production rate to approximately 7000 units per week on a sustained basis by the end of 2019 Moreover in China we expect to commence production of certain trims of Model 3 for the local market in China in the initial phase of our Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019 and then progressively increase levels of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing Inclusive of Gigafactory Shanghai our goal is to be able to produce 10000 Model 3 vehicles per week on a sustained basis and an annualized output rate in excess of 500000 Model 3 vehicles sometime between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020 However the timeframe for commencing Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online 16 We have limited experience to date in manufacturing vehicles at the high volumes that we recently achieved and to which we anticipate ramping further for Model 3 and to be successful we will need to complete the implementation and ramp of efficient and costeffective manufacturing capabilities processes and supply chains necessary to support such volumes including at Gigafactory Shanghai We are employing a higher degree of automation in the manufacturing processes for Model 3 than we have previously employed and to continue to implement additional automation In some cases we have temporarily reduced the levels of automation and introduced semiautomated or manual processes at additional labor cost Additional bottlenecks may also arise as we continue to ramp production at the Tesla Factory and commence the initial phase of Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai and it will be important that we address them promptly and in a costeffective manner Moreover our Model 3 production plan has generally required to date significant investments of cash and management resources and we expect to deploy some level of additional resources as we further progress our ramp and begin production in new locations in the future such as China Our production plan for Model 3 is based on many key assumptions including that we will be able to sustain and further expand our highvolume production of Model 3 at the Tesla Factory without exceeding our projected costs and on our projected timeline that we will be able to continue to expand Gigafactory 1 in a timely manner to produce high volumes of quality lithiumion cells to be integrated into battery modules and finished battery packs and drive unit components for Model 3 including in part to support production in China as the level of local sourcing and manufacturing there progressively increases all at costs that allow us to sell Model 3 at our target gross margins that we will be able to build and commence production at additional future facilities such as at Gigafactory Shanghai to support our international ramp for Model 3 in accordance with our projected costs and timeline that the equipment and processes which we have selected for Model 3 production will be able to accurately manufacture high volumes of Model 3 vehicles within specified design tolerances and with high quality that we will be able to maintain suppliers for the necessary components on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us and that we will be able to obtain highquality components on a timely basis and in the necessary quantities to support highvolume production and that we will be able to attract recruit hire train and retain skilled employees to operate our planned highvolume production facilities to support Model 3 including at the Tesla Factory Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory Shanghai If one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect our ability to meet our Model 3 projections on time and at volumes and prices that are profitable the demand for and deliveries of Model 3 as well as our business prospects operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted We may be unable to meet our growing vehicle production sales and delivery plans and servicing needs any of which could harm our business and prospects Our plans call for sustaining and further ramping from our significant increases in vehicle production and deliveries particularly for Model 3 Our ability to achieve these plans will depend upon a number of factors including our ability to utilize installed manufacturing capacity to achieve the planned production yield further install and increase capacity in accordance with our planned timelines and costs maintain our desired quality levels and optimize design and production changes as well as our suppliers ability to support our needs In addition we have used and may use in the future a number of new manufacturing technologies techniques and processes for our vehicles which we must successfully introduce and scale for highvolume production For example we have introduced highly automated production lines aluminum spot welding systems and highspeed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle parts We have also introduced unique design features in our vehicles with different manufacturing challenges such as large display screens dual motor drivetrain Autopilot hardware and falconwing doors We have limited experience developing manufacturing selling and servicing and allocating our available resources among multiple products simultaneously If we are unable to realize our plans our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially damaged 17 Concurrent with our increasing vehicle production levels we will also need to continue to significantly increase sales and deliveries of our vehicles Although we have a plan for selling and delivering increased volumes of vehicles we have limited experience in marketing selling and delivering vehicles at the higher volumes at which we are manufacturing Model 3 and we may face difficulties meeting our sales and delivery goals in both existing markets as well as new markets into which we expand such as Europe and China where we are beginning to deliver Model 3 for the first time in the first quarter of 2019 In particular we are targeting for the first time with Model 3 a mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers in which we have limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products While we are producing numerous variants including regional versions of Model 3 in accordance with the demand that we expect for them if our projections are inaccurate we may not be able to generate sales matched to the specific vehicles that we have the capacity to produce based on vehicle production line constraints and long lead times for procuring certain parts Moreover because we do not have independent dealer networks we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers and meeting their vehicle servicing needs To date we have limited experience with such deliveries and servicing at the scale to which we expect to grow particularly in international markets To accommodate our volumes we have deployed a number of delivery models such as deliveries to customers homes and workplaces some of which have not been previously tested at scale and in different geographies Moreover significant transit time may be required to transport vehicles such as Model 3 in volume into new markets for the first time To the extent that such factors lead to delays in our deliveries our results may be negatively impacted Finally because of our unique expertise with our vehicles we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by our service centers Mobile Service technicians or certain authorized professionals that we have specifically trained and equipped If we experience delays in adding such servicing capacity or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of Model 3 which we recently commenced producing at volume it could overburden our servicing capabilities If we are unable to ramp up to meet our sales delivery and servicing targets globally or our projections on which such targets are based are inaccurate this could result in negative publicity and damage to our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results Our future growth and success is dependent upon consumers willingness to adopt electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles especially in the mass market demographic which we are targeting with Model 3 Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles in general and electric vehicles in particular Although we have successfully grown demand for our vehicles thus far there is no guarantee of such future demand or that our vehicles will not compete with one another in the market Moreover the Model 3 mass market demographic is larger but more competitive than the demographic for Model S and Model X and additional electric vehicles are entering the market If the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be harmed We have only recently begun high volume production of vehicles are still at an earlier stage and have limited resources relative to our competitors and the market for alternative fuel vehicles is rapidly evolving As a result the market for our vehicles could be affected by numerous factors such as p erceptions about electric vehicle features quality safety performance and cost perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge competition including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles plugin hybrid electric vehicles and high fueleconomy internal combustion engine vehicles volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline government regulations and economic incentives access to charging facilities and concerns about our future viability 18 We are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are singlesource suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products according to our schedule and at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently manage these components could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results Our products contain numerous purchased parts which we source globally from hundreds of direct suppliers the majority of whom are currently singlesource suppliers although we attempt to qualify and obtain components from multiple sources whenever feasible Any significant increases in our production may require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time and in the past we have also replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources of supply for most of our components in a relatively short time frame there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our products Moreover we have signed longterm agreements with Panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and supplier for lithiumion cells at Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and PV cells and panels at Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo New York If we encounter unexpected difficulties with key suppliers such as Panasonic and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers we could experience production delays and potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing servicing and supporting our products This limited and in many cases single source supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for the production of our products such as those which we experienced in 2012 and 2016 in connection with our slowerthanplanned Model S and Model X ramps Furthermore unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing labor issues wars governmental changes natural disasters such as the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan and other factors beyond our and our suppliers control could also affect our suppliers ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to product design changes and delays in product deliveries to our customers which could hurt our relationships with our customers and result in negative publicity damage to our brand and a material and adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results Changes in our supply chain have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost We have also experienced cost increases from certain of our suppliers in order to meet our quality targets and development timelines as well as due to our design changes and we may experience similar cost increases in the future Certain suppliers have sought to renegotiate the terms of supply arrangements Additionally we are negotiating with existing suppliers for cost reductions seeking new and less expensive suppliers for certain parts and attempting to redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to control and reduce supplier costs our operating results will suffer In particular because we are producing Model 3 at significantly higher volumes than any of our other products to date the negative impact of any delays or other constraints with respect to our suppliers for Model 3 could be substantially greater than any supply chainrelated issues experienced with respect to our other products We need our Model 3 suppliers to sustainably ramp in accordance with our ongoing ramp of Model 3 and deliver according to our schedule There is no assurance that these suppliers will ultimately be able to sustainably and timely meet our cost quality and volume needs For example we may experience issues or delays increasing the level of localization in China through local sourcing and manufacturing at our Gigafactory Shanghai Furthermore as the scale of our vehicle production increases we will need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facilities components at much higher volumes If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and writeoff costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 19 Future problems or delays in expanding Gigafactory 1 or ramping operations there could negatively affect the production and profitability of our products such as Model 3 and our energy storage products To lower the cost of cell production and produce cells in high volume we have vertically integrated the production of lithiumion cells and finished battery packs for Model 3 and energy storage products at Gigafactory 1 While Gigafactory 1 began producing lithiumion cells for energy storage products in January 2017 and has since begun producing lithiumion cells for Model 3 we have no other direct experience in the production of lithiumion cells Given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in issues or delays in further ramping and expanding production at Gigafactory 1 Moreover we expect that we will need additional production at Gigafactory 1 to support vehicle production at Gigafactory Shanghai in part when we commence Model 3 production there In order to achieve our volume and gross margin targets for Model 3 and the anticipated ramp in production of energy storage products we must continue to sustain and ramp significant cell production at Gigafactory 1 which among other things requires Panasonic to successfully operate and further ramp its cell production lines at significant volumes Although Panasonic has a long track record of producing highquality cells at significant volume at its factories in Japan it has limited experience with cell production at Gigafactory 1 In addition we produce several components for Model 3 such as battery modules incorporating the lithiumion cells produced by Panasonic and drive units at Gigafactory 1 Some of the manufacturing lines for such components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity While we have largely overcome this bottleneck after deploying multiple semiautomated lines and improving our original lines additional bottlenecks may arise as we continue to increase the production rate Finally we have announced that we will likely manufacture Model Y at Gigafactory 1 If we are unable to maintain Gigafactory 1 production ramp additionally over time as needed and do so costeffectively or if we or Panasonic are unable to attract hire and retain a substantial number of highly skilled personnel our ability to supply battery packs or other components for Model 3 and our other products could be negatively impacted which could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results If our vehicles or other products that we sell or install fail to perform as expected our ability to develop market and sell our products and services could be harmed If our vehicles or our energy products contain defects in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair or certain features of our vehicles such as full selfdriving take longer than expected to become enabled or are legally restricted our ability to develop market and sell our products and services could be harmed For example the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects and errors or be subject to external attacks Issues experienced by vehicle customers have included those related to the software for the 17 inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12volt battery in the Model S and the seats and doors in the Model X Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible such efforts may not be timely may hamper production or may not be to the satisfaction of our customers While we have performed extensive internal testing on the products we manufacture we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed longterm quality reliability durability and performance characteristics of our battery packs powertrains vehicles and energy storage products There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for consumers Any product defects delays or legal restrictions on product features or other failure of our products to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delays product recalls product liability claims and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating results and prospects 20 If we fail to scale our business operations and otherwise manage future growth and adapt to new conditions effectively as we rapidly grow our company including internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our products successfully Any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition We expect to continue to expand our operations significantly including internationally and with our increasing production of Model 3 and the worldwide sales delivery and servicing of a significantly higher number of vehicles than our current vehicle fleet in the coming years Furthermore we are developing and growing our energy storage product and solar business worldwide including in countries where we have limited or no previous operating experience Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage our expansion and growth successfully We may not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to control expenses and avoid cost overruns and other unexpected operating costs establish sufficient worldwide automobile sales delivery service and Supercharger facilities in a timely manner adapt our products and conduct our operations to meet local requirements implement required local infrastructure systems and processes and find and hire a significant number of additional manufacturing engineering service electrical installation construction and administrative personnel In particular we plan to expand our manufacturing capabilities outside of the US where we have limited experience operating a factory or managing related regulatory financing and other challenges For example as part of our continuing work to increase Model 3 production to 10000 vehicles per week on a sustained basis and make Model 3 affordable in the markets where we plan to offer it we expect to commence the initial phase of Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai for the local market in China by the end of 2019 although the timeframe for that is subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online As we expect to commence our manufacturing activities in China using progressively increased levels of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing we expect that we will need to initially support manufacturing activities there with production processes at our existing manufacturing facilities such as Gigafactory 1 Moreover local manufacturing is critical to our expansion and sales in China which is the largest market for electric vehicles in the world Our sales of Model S and Model X in China have been negatively impacted by certain tariffs on automobiles manufactured in the US such as our vehicles and our costs for producing our vehicles in the US have also been affected by import duties on certain components sourced from China If we are not able to establish manufacturing activities in China and other jurisdictions to minimize the impact of such unfavorable tariffs duties or costs or ramp our production capabilities at Gigafactory 1 or other facilities to support such vehicle manufacturing activities our ability to compete in such jurisdictions and our operating results business and prospects will be harmed If we are unable to achieve our targeted manufacturing costs for our vehicles including Model 3 our financial condition and operating results will suffer While we are continuing to and expect in the future to realize cost reductions by both us and our suppliers there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost savings to reach our gross margin and profitability goals including for the least expensive variant of Model 3 that we ultimately expect to produce or our other financial targets We incur significant costs related to procuring the materials required to manufacture our vehicles assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel If our efforts to continue to decrease manufacturing costs are not successful we may incur substantial costs or cost overruns in utilizing and increasing the production capability of our vehicle manufacturing facilities such as for Model 3 both in the US and internationally Many of the factors that impact our manufacturing costs are beyond our control such as potential increases in the costs of our materials and components such as lithium nickel and other components of our battery cells or aluminum used to produce body panels If we are unable to continue to control and reduce our manufacturing costs our operating results business and prospects will be harmed 21 Increases in costs disruption of supply or shortage of materials in particular for lithiumion cells could harm our business We may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials Any such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results We use various materials in our business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper and cobalt as well as lithiumion cells from suppliers The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials including as a result of increased production of electric vehicles and energy storage products by our competitors and could adversely affect our business and operating results For instance we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithiumion cells These risks include an increase in the cost or decrease in the available supply of materials used in the cells disruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by battery cell manufacturers or any issues that may arise with respect to cells manufactured at our own facilities and fluctuations in the value of the Japanese yen against the US dollar as our batterycell purchases for Model S and Model X and some raw materials for cells used in Model 3 and energy storage products are currently denominated in Japanese yen Our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for the battery packs used in our vehicles and energy storage products While we believe several sources of the battery cells are available for such battery packs and expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cells manufactured at our own facilities we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of suppliers for the cells used in such battery packs and have very limited flexibility in changing cell suppliers Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such suppliers could disrupt production of our vehicles and of the battery packs we produce for energy products until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified Furthermore fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and material costs Substantial increases in the prices for our materials or prices charged to us such as those charged by battery cell suppliers would increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices Any attempts to increase vehicle prices in response to increased material costs could result in cancellations of vehicle orders and reservations and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospects and operating results We may become subject to product liability claims which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims Although we design our vehicles to be the safest vehicles on the road product liability claims even those without merit could harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition The automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected As is true for other automakers our cars have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in crashes resulting in death or personal injury and such crashes where Autopilot is engaged are the subject of significant public attention We have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of new technologies that we are pioneering including Autopilot in our vehicles Moreover as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity they have the potential to cause injury to people or property A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of vehicles and energy storage products delivered to date and limited field experience of our products Moreover a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have a material adverse effect on our brand business prospects and operating results In most jurisdictions we generally selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds not by insurance 22 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in these industries We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future including competition from companies with new technology The worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicles is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future There is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which they compete A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers as well as other companies have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plugin hybrid and fully electric vehicles as well as the market for selfdriving technology and applications In some cases such competitors have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing vehicle sales resources and networks than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products In particular some competitors have also announced plans to compete with us in important and large markets for electric vehicles such as China Increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales price reductions revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which could harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results In addition our Model 3 vehicle faces competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan market including Audi BMW Lexus and Mercedes The solar and energy storage industries are highly competitive We face competition from other manufacturers developers and installers of solar and energy storage systems as well as from large utilities Decreases in the retail prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults under our existing longterm leases and PPAs Moreover solar panel and lithiumion battery prices have declined and are continuing to decline As we increase our battery and solar manufacturing capabilities including at Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory 2 future price declines may harm our ability to produce energy storage systems and solar systems at competitive prices If we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our longterm business prospects among consumers analysts and within our industries then our financial condition operating results business prospects and stock price may suffer materially Consumers may be less likely to purchase our products if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and other operations will continue in the long term Similarly suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed Accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customers suppliers analysts ratings agencies and other parties in our longterm financial viability and business prospects Maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors such as our limited operating history negative press customer unfamiliarity with our products any delays in scaling manufacturing delivery and service operations to meet demand competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations and any other negative publicity related to us Many of these factors are largely outside our control and any negative perceptions about our longterm business prospects even if exaggerated or unfounded such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team could harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed 23 Our plan to generate ongoing growth and demand including by expanding and optimizing our retail service and vehicle charging operations will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet expectations with respect to additional sales installations or servicing of our products or availability of public charging solutions We plan to generate ongoing growth and demand including by globally expanding and optimizing our retail service and vehicle charging operations These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales or installations of our products This ongoing global expansion which includes planned entry into markets in which we have limited or no experience selling delivering installing andor servicing our products at scale and which may pose legal regulatory labor cultural and political challenges that we have not previously encountered may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and installations and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating Furthermore the increasing number of Tesla vehicles will require us to continue to increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors significantly in locations throughout the world If we fail to do so in a timely manner our customers could become dissatisfied which could adversely affect sales of our vehicles We will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale installation and service of our products the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy systems and operation of Superchargers in those jurisdictions which could take considerable time and expense If we experience any delays or cannot meet customer expectations in expanding our customer infrastructure network or our expansion plans are not successful in continuing to grow demand this could lead to a decrease or stagnation in sales or installations of our products and could negatively impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results We face risks associated with our global operations and expansion including unfavorable regulatory political economic tax and labor conditions and with establishing ourselves in new markets all of which could harm our business We currently have a global footprint with domestic and international operations and subsidiaries in various countries and jurisdictions and we continue to expand and optimize our retail service and Supercharger capabilities internationally Accordingly we are subject to a variety of legal political and regulatory requirements and social and economic conditions over which we have little control For example we may be impacted by trade policies political uncertainty and economic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies We are subject to a number of risks associated in particular with international business activities that may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention These risks include conforming our products to various international regulatory and safety requirements as well as charging and other electric infrastructures organizing local operating entities difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations challenges in attracting customers foreign government taxes regulations and permit requirements our ability to enforce our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange controls and preferences of foreign nations for domestically manufactured products For example in China which is a key market for us certain products such as automobiles manufactured in the US have become subject to a recently increased tariff imposed by the government While such increase has been temporarily suspended the tariff could remain in place for an undetermined length of time be further increased in the future andor lead consumers to postpone or choose another vehicle brand subject to lower tariffs or no tariffs Moreover recently increased import duties on certain components used in our products that are sourced from China may increase our costs and negatively impact our operating results 24 Our vehicles and energy storage products make use of lithiumion battery cells which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such events have raised concerns and future events may lead to additional concerns about the batteries used in automotive applications The battery packs that we produce make use of lithiumion cells On rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells While we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cells release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur which could subject us to lawsuits product recalls or redesign efforts all of which would be time consuming and expensive Also negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithiumion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithiumion cells such as a vehicle or other fire even if such incident does not involve our vehicles or energy storage products could seriously harm our business In addition we store a significant number of lithiumion cells at our facilities and are producing high volumes of cells and battery modules and packs at Gigafactory 1 Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations Such damage or injury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall Moreover any failure of a competitors electric vehicle or energy storage product may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products Such adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results If we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual financing and credit risks related to our vehicle financing programs our business may suffer We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions We also currently offer Model S and Model X leasing directly through our local subsidiaries in the US and Canada Under a lease held directly by us we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease The profitability of any vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles residual values at the outset of the leases and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles The leasing program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing andor business partners to fund and grow this program and screen for and manage customer credit risk We expect the availability of leasing and other financing options will be important for our vehicle customers If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal funds or partners or other external financing sources and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers we may be unable to grow our sales Furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the greater levels of residual and credit risks resulting from growth Finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state andor local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing lease transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties either of which may harm our business Moreover we have provided resale value guarantees to customers and partners for certain financing programs under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at predetermined amounts However actual resale values as with residual values for leased vehicles are subject to similar fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the predetermined amounts we have offered our operating results profitability andor liquidity could be negatively impacted 25 The unavailability reduction or elimination of or unfavorable determinations with respect to government and economic incentives in the US and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles energy storage products or solar energy could have some impact on demand for our products and services We and our customers currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles In the US and abroad such incentives include among other things tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles In Norway for example the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes the 25 value added tax or the carbon dioxide and weightbased purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gaspowered vehicles Notably the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided to gaspowered vehicles through the oil and gas industries Nevertheless even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced eliminated or exhausted For example under current regulations a 7500 federal tax credit that was available in the US for the purchase of our vehicles is being reduced in phases during and will sunset at the end of 2019 We believe the first reduction in this tax credit may have pulled forward some nearterm demand in the US into 2018 and could create similar pullforwards in 2019 before each further step reduction in the federal tax credit Moreover in July 2018 a previously available incentive for purchases of Model 3 in Ontario Canada was cancelled and Tesla buyers in Germany lost access to electric vehicle incentives for a short period of time beginning late 2017 In April 2017 and January 2016 respectively previously available incentives in Hong Kong and Denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired negatively impacting sales Effective March 2016 California implemented regulations phasing out a 2500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for highincome consumers Such developments could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles and we and our customers may have to adjust to them In addition certain governmental rebates tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our installation costs and cost of capital and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds However these incentives may expire on a particular date when the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase often without warning For example the US federal government currently offers a 30 ITC for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a cosited solar power facility The ITC is currently scheduled to decline in phases ultimately to 10 for commercial and utility systems and to 0 for customerowned residential systems by January 2022 Likewise in jurisdictions where net energy metering is currently available our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use Several jurisdictions have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed to do so Such reductions in or termination of governmental incentives could adversely impact our results by making our products less competitive for potential customers increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets Additionally the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US could potentially increase the cost and decrease the availability of renewable energy financing by reducing the value of depreciation benefits associated with and the overall investor tax capacity needed to monetize renewable energy projects Such changes could lower the overall investment willingness and capacity for such projects available in the market Moreover we and our fund investors claim the ITC and certain state incentives in amounts based on the fair market value of our solar and energy storage systems Although we obtain independent appraisals to support the claimed fair market values the relevant governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that they should be lower and they may do so again in the future Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences andor our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors 26 Any failure by us to realize the expected benefits of our substantial investments and commitments with respect to the manufacture of PV cells and modules including if we are unable to comply with the terms of our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York relating to our Gigafactory 2 could result in negative consequences for our business We own certain PV cell and module manufacturing and technology assets and a buildtosuit lease arrangement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York the SUNY Foundation This agreement with the SUNY Foundation provides for the construction of Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo New York with the intended capacity to produce at least 10 GW of solar products annually Under this agreement we are obligated to among other things employ specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10year period following the completion of all construction and related infrastructure the arrival of manufacturing equipment and the receipt of certain permits and other specified items at Gigafactory 2 If we fail in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligations we would be obligated to pay a program payment of 412 million to the SUNY Foundation in such year Any inability on our part to comply with the requirements of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation the termination of our lease at Gigafactory 2 andor the need to secure an alternative supply of PV cells and modules for our solar products Moreover if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and technology assets in accordance with our expectations we may have to recognize accounting charges pertaining to the writeoff of such assets Any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results If we are unable to attract andor retain key employees and hire qualified personnel our ability to compete could be harmed The loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services and negatively impact our business prospects and operating results In particular we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer and Jeffrey B Straubel our Chief Technology Officer None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key technology sales marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel especially to support our highvolume manufacture of vehicles and expansion plans and any failure or delay in doing so could adversely impact our business prospects financial condition and operating results Key talent may leave Tesla due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience or any negative publicity related to us In California Nevada and other regions where we have operations there is increasing competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles software engineering manufacturing engineering and other skills such as electrical and building construction expertise This competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones Moreover we have in the past conducted reductions in force in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and certain senior personnel have also departed for various reasons Our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employees in a timely manner especially to support our expansion plans and to retain current employees or replace departed senior employees with qualified and experienced individuals which is typically a timeconsuming process Additionally we compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and startups and emerging companies that promise shortterm growth opportunities Difficulties in retaining current employees or recruiting new ones could have an adverse effect on our performance and results 27 Finally our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins with an emphasis on equitybased awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the longterm interests of our stockholders Each of our current equity incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan provides for an evergreen provision that permits our board of directors to increase on an annual basis subject to specified limits the number of equitybased awards that may be granted to and shares of our common stock that may be purchased by our personnel thereunder These plans are currently scheduled to expire in December 2019 and we will need to extend them or establish new plans in order to continue to compensate our employees following their expiration which will require the approval of our stockholders Moreover there is no assurance that these plans as extended or any future plans will contain evergreen provisions which would mean that we would have to periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards that may be granted and shares that may be purchased under such plans If we are unable to obtain such stockholder approvals and compensate our personnel in accordance with our compensation philosophy our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel would be negatively impacted We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer and largest stockholder Although Mr Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla Mr Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and is involved in other emerging technology ventures We are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems and use security measures designed to protect our systems against breaches and cyberattacks If these efforts are not successful our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results and reputation could be harmed We are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems including implementing new internally developed systems to assist us in the management of our business In particular our volume production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the US and abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance systems We also maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft data breaches and other cyberattacks The implementation maintenance and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost Moreover there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sales and service processes These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicles or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations We cannot be sure that these systems or their required functionality will be effectively implemented maintained or expanded as planned If we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these systems as planned our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results Moreover our proprietary information could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions 28 Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products and harm our business Our products contain complex information technology systems For example our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality We have designed implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks our products and their systems However hackers have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such networks products and systems to gain control of or to change our products functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products via our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability Accordingly we have received reports of potential vulnerabilities in the past and have attempted to remedy them However there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be exploited in the future before they can be identified or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings In addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our products their systems or data as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products their systems or data are capable of being hacked could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results We have been the subject of such reports in the past We are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities As a manufacturing company including with respect to facilities such as the Tesla Factory Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory 2 we are subject to complex environmental health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the US and abroad including laws relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials The costs of compliance including remediating contamination if any is found on our properties and any changes to our operations mandated by new or amended laws may be significant We may also face unexpected delays in obtaining permits and approvals required by such laws in connection with our manufacturing facilities which would hinder our operation of these facilities Such costs and delays may adversely impact our business prospects and operating results Furthermore any violations of these laws may result in substantial fines and penalties remediation costs third party damages or a suspension or cessation of our operations Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities It is common for employees at companies with significant manufacturing operations such as us to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages Moreover regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the US mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies operations Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory The United Automobile Workers UAW has been engaged in a campaign to organize manufacturing operations at Tesla As part of that campaign the UAW has filed with the National Labor Relations Board NLRB a series of unfair labor practice charges against Tesla on which a hearing recently concluded We cannot predict the timing of the NLRBs decision and an unfavorable outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Teslas treatment of our employees Furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results If a work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business prospects operating results or financial condition 29 Our products and services are subject to substantial regulations which are evolving and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results Motor vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local laws We incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and may be required to incur additional costs to comply with any changes to such regulations and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses delays or fines We are subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply manufacture import sale and service of automobiles internationally For example in countries outside of the US we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and emissions among other things that are often materially different from requirements in the US thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements Additionally our vehicles are equipped with a suite of driverassistance features called Autopilot which help assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel but require drivers to remain engaged There is a variety of international federal and state regulations that may apply to selfdriving vehicles which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a driver Such regulations continue to rapidly change which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations or may delay products or restrict selfdriving features and availability any of which could adversely affect our business Moreover as a manufacturer and installer of solar generation and energy storage systems and a supplier of electricity generated and stored by the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers we are impacted by federal state and local regulations and policies concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by thirdparty owned systems For example existing or proposed regulations and policies would permit utilities to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customers with their solar energy systems charge fees and penalties to our customers relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid adjust electricity rate designs such that the price of our solar products may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid restrict us and our customers from transacting under our PPAs or qualifying for government incentives and benefits that apply to solar power and limit or eliminate net energy metering If such regulations and policies remain in effect or are adopted in other jurisdictions or if other regulations and policies that adversely impact the interconnection or use of our solar and energy storage systems are introduced they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions which could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations Failure to comply with various privacy and consumer protection laws to which we are subject could harm the Company Our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages and other costs Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws and in particular certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation and application For example in May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation the GDPR began to fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union The GDPR has created new compliance obligations and has significantly increased fines for noncompliance Although we take steps to protect the security of our customers personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers personal information A major breach of our network security and systems could have negative consequences for our business and future prospects including possible fines penalties and damages reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand 30 We may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance Any product recall with respect to our products may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition For example certain vehicle recalls that we initiated have resulted from various causes including a component that could prevent the parking brake from releasing once engaged a concern with the firmware in the restraints control module in certain righthanddrive vehicles industrywide issues with airbags from a particular supplier Model X seat components that could cause unintended seat movement during a collision and concerns of corrosion in Model S power steering assist motor bolts Furthermore testing of our products by government regulators or industry groups may require us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products In the future we may at various times voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our products or our electric vehicle powertrain components that we have provided to other vehicle OEMs including any systems or parts sourced from our suppliers prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as federal motor vehicle safety standards Such recalls whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target markets as well as our business prospects financial condition and results of operations Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance Subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system battery and drive unit we provide fouryear or 50000mile limited warranties for the purchasers of new Model 3 Model S and Model X vehicles and either a fouryear or 50000mile limited warranty or a twoyear or 100000mile maximum odometer limited warranty for the purchasers of used Model S or Model X vehicles certified and sold by us The limited warranty for the battery and drive unit for new Model S and Model X vehicles covers the drive unit for eight years as well as the battery for a period of eight years or for certain older vehicles 125000 miles if reached sooner than eight years although the batterys charging capacity is not covered under any of our warranties or Extended Service plans the limited warranty for used Model S and Model X vehicles does not extend or otherwise alter the terms of the original battery and drive unit limited warranty for such used vehicles specified in their original New Vehicle Limited Warranty For the battery and drive unit on our current new Model 3 vehicles we offer an eightyear or 100000mile limited warranty for our standard or midrange battery and an eightyear or 120000mile limited warranty for our longrange battery with minimum 70 retention of battery capacity over the warranty period In addition customers of new Model S and Model X vehicles have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of the limited warranty for their new vehicles to cover additional services for up to an additional four years or 50000 miles For energy storage products we provide limited warranties against defects and to guarantee minimum energy retention levels For example we currently guarantee that each Powerwall 2 product will maintain at least 70 or 80 depending on the region of installation of its stated energy capacity after 10 years and that each Powerpack 2 product will retain specified minimum energy capacities in each of its first 15 years of use For our Solar Roof we currently offer a warranty on the glass tiles for the lifetime of a customers home and a separate warranty for the energy generation capability of the solar tiles We also offer extended warranties availability guarantees and capacity guarantees for periods of up to 20 years at an additional cost at the time of purchase as well as workmanship warranties to customers who elect to have us install their systems Finally customers who lease solar energy system leases or buy energy from us under PPAs are covered by warranties equal to the length of the agreement term which is typically 20 years Systems purchased for cash are covered by a workmanship warranty of up to 20 years In addition we pass through to our customers the inverter and panel manufacturers warranties which generally range from 10 to 25 years Finally we provide a performance guarantee with our leased solar energy systems that compensates a customer on an annual basis if their system does not meet the electricity production guarantees set forth in their lease Under these performance guarantees we bear the risk of production shortfalls resulting from an inverter or panel failure These risks are exacerbated in the event the panel or inverter manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties 31 If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our business prospects financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected Warranty reserves include our managements best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty These estimates are based on actual claims incurred todate and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such as Model 3 and Solar Roof that we have recently introduced andor that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future Our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks We may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of God and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage As a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all Additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or selfinsured retentions and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results Our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors We expect our periodtoperiod financial results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities such as Gigafactory Shanghai may not be consistent or linear between periods Additionally our revenues from periodtoperiod may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products As a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance Moreover our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts ratings agencies or investors who may be focused only on quarterly financial results If any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time Servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness As of December 31 2018 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 1100 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see Note 13 LongTerm Debt Obligations to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions We and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt Pursuant to their terms holders of our 025 Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 125 Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 and 2375 Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 collectively the Tesla Convertible Notes may convert their respective Tesla Convertible Notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the respective Tesla Convertible Notes under certain circumstances Upon conversion of the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes we will be obligated to deliver cash andor shares in respect of the principal amounts thereof and the conversion value in excess of such principal amounts on such Tesla Convertible Notes Moreover our subsidiarys 1625 Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 and ZeroCoupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 together the Subsidiary Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at conversion prices ranging from 30000 to 75936 per share Finally holders of the Tesla Convertible Notes and the Subsidiary Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date 32 Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures If we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time In addition our ability to make payments may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all which could result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business The terms of certain of our credit facilities including our senior secured asset based revolving credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or make other restricted payments and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt In addition under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio As a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions including to obtain additional financing as needed may be restricted Furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt If any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it We may need or want to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected The design manufacture sale installation andor servicing of automobiles energy storage products and solar products is a capital intensive business and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period Until we are consistently generating positive free cash flows we may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund together with our principal sources of liquidity the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicles energy storage products andor solar products to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness We need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations ramp vehicle production continue research and development projects establish sales delivery and service centers build and deploy Superchargers expand Gigafactory 1 ramp production at Gigafactory 2 build and commence Model 3 production at Gigafactory Shanghai and to make the investments in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicles energy storage products and solar products We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 33 Additionally we use capital from thirdparty investors to enable our customers access to our solar energy systems with little or no upfront cost The availability of this financing depends upon many factors including the confidence of the investors in the solar energy industry the quality and mix of our customer contracts any regulatory changes impacting the economics of our existing customer contracts changes in law including tax law risks or government incentives associated with these financings and our ability to compete with other renewable energy companies for the limited number of potential investors Moreover while interest rates remain at low levels they have risen in recent periods If the rate of return required by investors rises as a result of a rise in interest rates it will reduce the present value of the customer payment streams underlying and therefore the total value of our financing structures increasing our cost of capital If we are unable to establish new financing funds on favorable terms for thirdparty ownership arrangements we may be unable to finance the installation of our solar energy systems for our lease or PPA customers systems or our cost of capital could increase and our liquidity may be negatively impacted which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations We could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Aside from the settlement with the SEC discussed below relating to Elon Musks statement that he was considering taking Tesla private to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred However we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC the DOJ or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future Moreover we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas and if instituted in defending against any governmental proceedings For example on October 16 2018 the US District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29 2018 in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Mr Musks statement on August 7 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private Pursuant to the settlement we among other things paid a civil penalty of 20 million appointed an independent director as the Chair of the Board appointed two additional independent directors to the Board and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governancerelated matters Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement if there is a lack of compliance additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us If we update or discontinue the use of our manufacturing equipment more quickly than expected we may have to shorten the useful lives of any equipment to be retired as a result of any such update and the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect our financial results We have invested and expect to continue to invest significantly in what we believe is state of the art tooling machinery and other manufacturing equipment for our various product lines and we depreciate the cost of such equipment over their expected useful lives However manufacturing technology may evolve rapidly and we may decide to update our manufacturing process with cuttingedge equipment more quickly than expected Moreover we are continually implementing learnings as our engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency increase which may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment Alternatively as we ramp production of Model 3 to higher levels our learnings may cause us to discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 34 We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results Our revenues and costs denominated in foreign currencies are not completely matched As we have increased vehicle deliveries in markets outside of the US we have much higher revenues than costs denominated in other currencies such as the euro Canadian dollar Chinese yuan and Norwegian krone Any strengthening of the US dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in US dollars as we have historically experienced In addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the Japanese yen If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the US dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured in US dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer Moreover while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact As a result our operating results could be adversely affected We may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles We sell our vehicles directly to consumers using means that we believe will maximize our reach currently including through our website and our own stores While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in each state in the US as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this directtoconsumer sales model In certain states in which we are not able to obtain dealer licenses we have opened galleries which are not full sales locations The application of these state laws to our operations continues to be difficult to predict Laws in some states have limited our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so In addition decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model In some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate We have also filed a lawsuit in federal court in Michigan challenging the constitutionality of the states prohibition on direct sales as applied to our business Internationally there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers could have a negative and material impact our business prospects financial condition and results of operations We may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and could cause us to incur substantial costs Others including our competitors may hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our products and services which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business From time to time the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses andor may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights We may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur and such licenses could significantly increase our operating expenses In addition if we are determined to have infringed upon a third partys intellectual property rights we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to redesign our products and services andor to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services In the event that we were required to take one or more such actions our business prospects operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected In addition any litigation or claims whether or not valid could result in substantial costs negative publicity and diversion of resources and management attention 35 Tesla is a highlyvisible public company whose products business results of operations statements and actions are often scrutinized by critics whose influence could negatively impact the perception of our brand and the market value of our common stock Tesla is a highlyvisible public company whose products business results of operations statements and actions are wellpublicized Such attention includes frequent criticism of us by a range of thirdparties Our continued success depends on our ability to focus on executing on our mission and business plan while maintaining the trust of our current and potential customers employees stockholders and business partners Any negative perceived actions of ours could influence the perception of our brand or our leadership by our customers suppliers or investors which could adversely impact our business prospects operating results and the market value of our common stock Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters Our corporate headquarters the Tesla Factory and Gigafactory 1 are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada If major disasters such as earthquakes or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products We may incur expenses relating to such damages which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control Our common stock has experienced an intraday trading high of 38746 per share and a low of 24459 per share over the last 52 weeks The stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies In particular a large proportion of our common stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in its market price Public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance In addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies Moreover stockholder litigation like this has been filed against us in the past While we are continuing to defend such actions vigorously any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which could cause our stock price to decline We provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such as projections regarding sales and production as well as anticipated future revenues gross margins profitability and cash flows Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes which generally are not linear throughout a given period average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions If our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual results due to our inability to meet our assumptions or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties the market value of our common stock could decline significantly 36 Transactions relating to our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock The conversion of some or all of the Tesla Convertible Notes or the Subsidiary Convertible Notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes Our Subsidiary Convertible Notes have been historically and the other Tesla Convertible Notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances If holders elect to convert their convertible notes we could be required to deliver to them a significant number of shares of our common stock Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock In addition the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock Moreover in connection with each issuance of the Tesla Convertible Notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable Tesla Convertible Notes We also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates In addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions which could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible notes Elon Musk has pledged shares of our common stock to secure certain bank borrowings If Mr Musk were forced to sell these shares pursuant to a margin call that he could not avoid or satisfy such sales could cause our stock price to decline Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third party participants in such offerings and placements We are not a party to these loans which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr Musk If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially and Mr Musk were unable to avoid or satisfy a margin call with respect to his pledged shares Mr Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of his loans Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further Antitakeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws and our convertible notes could impair a takeover attempt Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that could contribute to the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations In addition the terms of our convertible notes require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change including a takeover of our company Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None 37 ITEM 2 PR OPERTIES The following table sets forth the location approximate current occupancy size and primary use of our

conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Overview and 2018 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy We design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems and energy storage products We also offer maintenance installation operation and other services related to our products Automotive Our production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan and our Model X SUV which are our highestperformance vehicles and our Model 3 a lowerpriced sedan designed for the mass market We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced Autopilot options internet connectivity and free overtheair software updates to provide additional safety convenience and performance features In addition we have several future electric vehicles in our product pipeline including Model Y Tesla Semi a pickup truck and a new version of the Tesla Roadster In 2018 we continued to scale our automotive operations particularly our ramp of Model 3 and achieved total production of 254530 vehicles and delivered 245506 vehicles representing yearoveryear increases of approximately 152 and 138 respectively Energy Generation and Storage We lease and sell retrofit solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products to our customers and are ramping our Solar Roof product that combines solar energy generation with attractive integrated styling Our energy storage products which we manufacture at Gigafactory 1 consist of Powerwall mostly for residential applications and Powerpack for commercial industrial and utilityscale applications During 2018 we deployed 104 GWh of energy storage products nearly tripling our 358 MWh of energy storage deployments during 2017 We also deployed 326 megawatts MW of solar energy generation during 2018 Management Opportunities Challenges and Risks and 2019 Outlook Automotive Demand Production and Deliveries Our goal is to produce the worlds highest quality vehicles as quickly and as costeffectively as possible with a priority on workplace health and safety The worldwide automotive markets for alternative fuel vehicles and selfdriving technology are highly competitive and we expect them to become even more so A growing number of companies including established automakers have announced plans to expand and in some cases fully transition to production of electric or environmentally friendly vehicles andor to develop selfdriving technologies However we believe that the unique features of our vehicles the safety aspects of each of our vehicles our constant innovation our growing brand the increased affordability introduced with Model 3 the innovation and expansion of our global retail service and charging operations and infrastructure and our future vehicles will continue to generate incremental demand for our vehicles by making our vehicles accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial markets 42 Model 3 was the bestselling premium vehicle in the United States in 2018 Vehicles traded in to us by Model 3 customers continue to suggest the existence of a wider addressable market for this vehicle than existing owners of midsized premium sedans Moreover as we have offered only the longrange midrange and performance variants of Model 3 thus far we believe that we will see increased demand with the introduction of less expensive variants such as a version with a base price of 35000 that we intend to offer in the future and additional financing options We commenced in January 2019 production of Model 3 for Europe and China each of which we believe has a much larger midsized premium sedan market than North America where we have exclusively delivered Model 3 to date We also believe that we have an advantage over our competitors with respect to our battery and powertrain technology as our vehicles EPArated range per kWh is expected to be superior to that of other electric vehicles to be introduced in the near term and we have the ability to improve our vehicles through overtheair software updates We are producing variants including regional versions of Model 3 in accordance with the demand that we expect for them however and we have finite production capabilities with long lead times associated with procuring certain parts If our Model 3 demand expectations prove inaccurate or we experience delays in introducing planned additional variants including as we begin offering Model 3 in new markets we may not be able to timely generate sales matched to the specific vehicles that we have the capacity to produce We may also be impacted by trade policies political uncertainty and economic cycles involving geographic regions where we have significant operations Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies In addition the federal tax credit for the purchase of a qualified electric vehicle in the US was reduced to 3750 for any Tesla vehicle delivered during the first or second quarter of 2019 and will be further reduced to 1875 for each Tesla vehicle delivered in the third or fourth quarter of 2019 and to 0 for each Tesla vehicle delivered thereafter We believe that this phaseout likely pulled forward some vehicle demand into 2018 and could create similar pullforwards in 2019 before each further step reduction in the federal tax credit In the long run we do not expect a meaningful impact to our sales in the US as we believe that each of our vehicle models offers a compelling proposition even without incentives Globally we are also working to and in some cases have already begun to increase the value proposition and affordability of our offerings to customers and offer other financing arrangements over time For example we intend to introduce leasing options for Model 3 Our Model 3 production ramped dramatically during 2018 and we expect to continue to grow Model 3 production to a sustained rate of 7000 vehicles per week at our Tesla Factory by the end of 2019 as we ramp international deliveries We remain focused on further cost improvements and on increasing the affordability of Model 3 Furthermore in January 2019 we commenced construction of our Gigafactory Shanghai in China We expect to build a production process that is optimized and simplified for Model 3 production comprised of stamping body joining and paint shops and general assembly at Gigafactory Shanghai to begin production of certain trims of Model 3 for China by the end of 2019 We believe that the efficiencies of local production as well as avoiding certain tariffs on USmanufactured vehicles will allow us to offer Model 3 at a lower average selling price in the largest market for electric vehicles in the world Inclusive of Gigafactory Shanghai our goal is to be able to produce 10000 Model 3 vehicles per week on a sustained basis and an annualized output rate in excess of 500000 Model 3 vehicles sometime between the fourth quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020 However the timeframe for Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online Ultimately achieving increased Model 3 production costeffectively will require that we timely address any additional bottlenecks that may arise as we continue to ramp and establish sustained supplier capacity including locally at Gigafactory Shanghai We also recently discontinued new custom orders for the 75 kWh versions of Model S and Model X to focus on longer range versions of our highestperformance flagship vehicles and further differentiate them from Model 3 We have gradually increased the level of option standardization across these models and this latest step and our increasing production efficiency have allowed us to reduce the production hours for them while preserving the flexibility to increase output as necessary As Model S and Model X are produced in the US for the foreseeable future we could be impacted by increased import duties on components sourced from China as well as by tariffs on vehicles exported to China although we intend to partially divert such deliveries to North America and Europe if necessary 43 Advancing our customerfacing infrastructure remains a top priority Delivering vehicles to our customers and the related logistics were challenging during 2018 but we continue to improve these processes to maximize customer satisfaction including by purchasing our own carhauling trucks We are also expanding our servicing capabilities for our rapidly growing customer vehicle fleet including by growing our service locations and Mobile Service fleet moving to twoshift operations at service centers where needed and optimizing our parts distribution network We are also updating the Tesla mobile app for scheduling service appointments in order to increase customer convenience As sales of Tesla vehicles ramp further we plan to continue to open new Tesla retail locations service centers and body shops around the world and we plan to continue to expand our Mobile Service fleet We also plan to continue to significantly increase the number of Superchargers and Destination Charging connectors globally as well as evolve our Supercharger technology to enable faster charging times while reducing our related costs However we will have to stabilize and sustain our delivery and logistics model to deliver an increasing number of vehicles and we have only limited experience with this at scale particularly in markets outside of North America Moreover if our growing fleet of customer vehicles particularly Model 3 experiences unexpected reliability issues it could overburden our servicing capabilities Finally we are making progress with our selfdriving technology as well as the Autopilot features in our vehicles Our neural net and functionality continue to improve and we frequently release minor software updates and from time to time release key version updates Recently we launched a Navigate on Autopilot feature that allows enabled Tesla vehicles under appropriate circumstances and driver input to change lanes transition between freeways and exit freeways While we are subject to regulatory constraints over which we have no control our ultimate goal is to achieve full autonomy Additionally there is growing competition from other automobile and technology companies in the area of selfdriving Energy Generation and Storage Demand Production and Deployment We are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products transitioning away from former channel partners and shifting our sales strategy significantly to sell these products in Tesla stores and on our website and through crossselling opportunities to our expanding base of vehicle owners As we continue to implement this strategy we expect that our retrofit solar system deployments will decrease slightly before stabilizing and growing in the second half of the year including through crossselling opportunities to our expanding base of vehicle owners Our emphasis for retrofit solar products remains on executing projects for upfront cash generation and profitability rather than absolute volume growth such as by reducing the mix of leased systems and prioritizing residential installations that are combined with our energy storage products We are continuing with the design iterations and testing on our Solar Roof product and we are continuing installations at a slow pace with the expectation that we will ramp production with significantly improved manufacturing capabilities during 2019 We expect our energy storage products to continue to experience significant growth and we are targeting to more than double our deployments to over 2 GWh in 2019 We see opportunities in North America as well as in Australia and Europe where energy storage coupled with solar generation may mitigate typically higher electricity rates as well as for projects to increase energy grid reliability We are continuing to ramp production for these products at Gigafactory 1 including through a new production line and we have seen further manufacturing efficiencies and improvements in our installation processes as we ramp Trends in Cash Flow Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses Capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be approximately 25 billion mostly to support increases in Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory 1 and the Tesla Factory the establishment of Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai and the addition of manufacturing capacity for Model Y which we intend to produce in volume by the end of 2020 as well as the ongoing expansion of our retail locations service centers body shops Mobile Service fleet and Supercharger stations Generally we expect operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future due to increases in expected revenues and as we focus on increasing operational efficiency In addition due to our cost management efforts to maximize operational efficiency we expect operating expenses in 2019 to grow by less than 10 from 2018 44 In March 2018 our stockholders approved a new 10year CEO performance award for Elon Musk with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestones the 2018 CEO Performance Award Consequently we may incur significant additional noncash stockbased compensation expense over the term of the award as each operational milestone becomes probable of vesting Automotive Financing Options We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain markets in North America Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions We offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners Currently both programs are available only in certain international markets Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months following December 31 2018 totaled 1497 million in value We have adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 effective January 1 2018 This impacts the way we account for vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners which now generally qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return In addition for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through leasing partners prior to 2018 we have ceased recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach Vehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our nearterm cash flows and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if a customer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under these programs may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we may be unable to resell the used vehicles in a timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flows To date we have only had an insignificant number of customers who exercised their resale value guarantees and returned their vehicles to us Based on current market demand for our vehicles we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amounts but resale prices may inherently fluctuate depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles Should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease these estimates may be impacted materially We currently offer Model S and Model X leasing directly through our local subsidiaries in the US and Canada We also offer leasing through leasing partners in certain jurisdictions Leasing through our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk In addition for leases offered directly from our captive financing entities we assume customer credit risk We plan to continue expanding our financing offerings including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them and to support the overall financing needs of our customers To the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are attractive our sales financial results and cash flows could be negatively impacted Energy Generation and Storage Financing Options We offer our customers the choice to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar energy systems produce through various contractual arrangements These contractual arrangements include longterm leases and PPAs In both structures we install our solar energy systems at our customers premises and charge the customer a monthly fee In the lease structure this monthly payment is fixed with a minimum production guarantee In the PPA structure we charge customers a fee per kilowatthour or kWh based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produces The leases and PPAs are typically for 20 years with a renewal option and the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations For customers who want to purchase and own solar energy systems we also offer solar loans whereby a thirdparty lender provides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system designed installed and serviced by us We enter into a standard solar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer Separately the customer enters into a loan agreement with a thirdparty lender who finances the full purchase price We are not a party to the loan agreement between the customer and the thirdparty lender and the thirdparty lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan 45 Gigafactory 1 We continue to develop Gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of battery material cells modules battery packs and drive units in one location for vehicles and energy storage products We also continue to invest in the future expansion of Gigafactory 1 and in additional production capacity there For example we have announced that we will likely manufacture Model Y at Gigafactory 1 Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery cells Under our arrangement with Panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices As these terms convey to us the right to use as defined in ASC 840 Leases their production equipment we consider them to be leased assets when production commences This results in us recording the value of their production equipment within property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to financing obligations For all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at Gigafactory 1 we will apply similar accounting During the year ended December 31 2018 we recorded 7666 million on the consolidated balance sheet While we currently believe that our progress at Gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets our ultimate ability to do so will require us to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp For example we have in the past experienced bottlenecks in the assembly of battery modules at Gigafactory 1 which negatively affected our production of Model 3 While we continue to resolve such issues at Gigafactory 1 as they arise given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future events could result in the cost of building and operating Gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and Gigafactory 1 taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate Gigafactory 2 We have an agreement with the SUNY Foundation for the construction of a factory with the intended capacity to produce at least 10 GW of solar products annually in Buffalo New York referred to as Gigafactory 2 In December 2016 we entered into an agreement with Panasonic under which it manufactures custom PV cells and modules for us primarily at Gigafactory 2 and we purchase certain quantities of PV cells and modules from Panasonic during the 10year term The terms of our agreement with the SUNY Foundation require us to comply with a number of covenants and any failure to comply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation and result in termination of the agreement Although we remain on track with our progress at Gigafactory 2 our expectations as to the cost of building the facility acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect which could subject us to significant expenses to achieve the desired benefits Gigafactory Shanghai We are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai in order to significantly increase the affordability of Model 3 for customers in China by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating certain tariffs on vehicles imported from the US We broke ground in January 2019 and subject to a number of uncertainties including regulatory approval supply chain constraints and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online we expect to begin production of certain trims of Model 3 at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2019 We expect much of the investment in Gigafactory Shanghai to be provided through local debt financing supported by limited direct capital expenditures by us Moreover we are targeting the capital expenditures per unit of production capacity at this factory to be less than that of our Model 3 production at the Tesla Factory from which we have drawn learnings that should allow us to simplify our manufacturing layout and processes at Gigafactory Shanghai Other Manufacturing We continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities and construct our planned facilities and continually explore additional production capacity internationally 46 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US GAAP The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures We base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period Accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows will be affected We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies Accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and results of operations Revenue Recognition Adoption of new revenue standard On January 1 2018 we adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers new revenue standard using the modified retrospective method The new revenue standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements For further discussion refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard including access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity Autopilot full selfdriving and overtheair software updates We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eightyear life of the vehicle Revenue related to Autopilot and full selfdriving features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer For our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available At the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns Such estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented In addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customers lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity Autopilot full selfdriving and overtheair software updates As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts 47 Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee We offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners Under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value With the exception of two programs which are discussed within the Automotive Leasing section we now recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicles estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customers economic incentive to exercise The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values The two programs that are still being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option and Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised For certain transactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840 Leases we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate The remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue The guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciated their value less estimated residual value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period In cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue If our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory Automotive Regulatory Credits California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zeroemission vehicles These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zeroemission vehicles may earn regulatory credits ZEV credits and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to greenhouse gas GHG emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers As a manufacturer solely of zeroemission vehicles we have earned emission credits such as ZEV and GHG credits on our vehicles and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future We enter into contractual agreements with thirdparties to purchase our regulatory credits Payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business We recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 48 Automotive Leasing Revenue Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the two programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases Direct Vehicle Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in certain locations in the US Canada and Europe Currently the direct vehicle leasing program is only offered for new leases to qualified customers in the US and Canada Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months At the end of the lease term customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue We capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions from the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease agreement Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option We offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees to certain leasing partner sales in the United States These transactions entail a transfer of leases which we have originated with an endcustomer to our leasing partner As control of the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard these transactions continue to be accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840 Leases Under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within deferred revenue We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheet and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement Cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease repayments borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows At the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue On a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values although we have not experienced any material losses during any period to date 49 Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable For certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicles estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customers economic incentive to exercise We have not sold any vehicles under this program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue If a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory Services and Other Revenue Services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers retail merchandise and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers There were no significant changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a standready obligation to the customer We sell used vehicles services service plans vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations Payment for used vehicles services and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales Energy generation and storage revenues consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customers Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering design and installation of the system Postinstallation residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a standready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and accepted by the customer Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business 50 For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contractspecific phases of a project Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs Certain largescale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where percentage of completion method does not apply revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered to the customer for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets However any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the contract In certain instances we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level Conversely if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements we may be required to pay liquidated damages Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur We record as deferred revenue any nonrefundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term Energy Generation and Storage Leasing For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840 Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which is recognized as revenue over the lease term 51 We capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or PPAs which include the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems leased and to be leased net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or PPA Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis In addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost We record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts If our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product Once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results Warranties We provide a manufacturers warranty on all new and used vehicles production powertrain components and systems and energy storage products we sell In addition we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet Due to the adoption of the new revenue standard automotive sales with resale value guarantees that were previously recorded within operating lease assets require a corresponding warranty accrual Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations StockBased Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units RSUs granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan the ESPP to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards The fair value of stock option awards with only service conditions and ESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using the BlackScholes optionpricing model The BlackScholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP Stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period prior to 2017 net of estimated projected forfeitures 52 For performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable For performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations As we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods Stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations Income Taxes We are subject to federal and state taxes in the US and in many foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans Tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals The US many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard As of December 31 2018 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net US deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our US deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted Furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions In the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain As a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes based on our estimates of the eventual outcome These effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities We are required to file income tax returns in the US and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made On December 22 2017 the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act was enacted into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code Changes include but are not limited to a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after December 31 2017 the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings We were required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as remeasuring our US deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net US deferred tax assets 53 In December 2017 the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act SAB 118 which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date As such in accordance with SAB 118 we completed our analysis during the fourth quarter of 2018 considering current legislation and guidance resulting in no material adjustments from the provisional amounts recorded during the prior year Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810 Consolidation we consolidate any variable interest entity VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary We form VIEs with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as VIEs through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of VIEs We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements We have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value HLBV method We therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries Under the HLBV method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the thirdparties The thirdparties interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties However the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets 54 Business Combinations We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805 Business Combinations The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred Identifiable assets including intangible assets liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date When determining such fair values we make significant estimates and assumptions Critical estimates include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from the underlying assets and discount rates Our estimate of fair values is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable As a result actual results may differ from our estimates Furthermore our estimates might change as additional information becomes available as more fully discussed in Note 3 Business Combinations included elsewhere in this Annual

Total revenues 21461268 11758751 7000132 9702517 83 4758619 68 Automotive Services and Other Segment Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to sale of new Model S Model X and Model 3 vehicles including access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity Autopilot full selfdriving and overtheair software updates as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers Our revenue from nonZEV regulatory credits generally follows our production and delivery trends as we have longterm contracts with existing customers for the sale of these credits However as we do not have longterm contracts for ZEV credit sales revenue from sale of ZEV credits fluctuate by quarter depending on when a contract is executed with a buyer For example our revenue from ZEV credit sales in the three months ended December 31 2017 was 1791 million while it was 0 in the three months ended June 30 2018 Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for Model S and Model X vehicles under direct lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting We do not yet offer leasing for Model 3 vehicles Services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers retail merchandise and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers 55 2018 Compared to 2017 Automotive sales revenue increased 910 billion or 107 in the year ended December 31 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31 2017 primarily due to an increase of approximately 144330 Model 3 deliveries from our significant production ramp in the year ended December 31 2018 delivered at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent yearoveryear Additionally we recognized 140 billion of additional automotive sales revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard and an increase of 583 million in sales of regulatory credits to 4186 million in the year ended December 31 2018 ZEV credits sales were 1034 million and nonZEV regulatory credits sales were 3152 million in the year ended December 31 2018 compared to 2797 million ZEV credit sales and 806 million in nonZEV regulatory credit sales in the year ended December 31 2017 The growth in nonZEV regulatory credits yearoveryear was generally consistent with the delivery volume growth The above increases in revenue were offset by a decrease of approximately 3240 Model S and Model X deliveries during the year ended December 31 2018 excluding the impact of adoption of the new revenue standard at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the year ended December 31 2017 Automotive leasing revenue decreased 2231 million or 20 in the year ended December 31 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31 2017 The decrease was primarily due to a downward adjustment of 8327 million from the adoption of the new revenue standard partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs where our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period when compared to the year ended December 31 2017 When our counterparty retains ownership any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee are settled to automotive leasing revenue Services and other revenue increased 3899 million or 39 in the year ended December 31 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31 2017 The increase was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales from an increased volume of tradein vehicles partially offset by lower average selling prices for used vehicles sales due to an increase in tradeins of relatively lower priced nonTesla vehicles in the year ended December 31 2018 Additionally there was an increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow These increases were partially offset by a decrease in powertrain sales to another automobile manufacturer as we wound down the program in 2017 2017 Compared to 2016 Automotive sales revenue increased 295 billion or 53 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 primarily related to a 58 increase in deliveries to 80060 vehicles resulting from increased sales of Model S and Model X at average selling prices that remained relatively consistent as compared to the prior period as well as sales of 1764 Model 3 vehicles since its launch in the third quarter of 2017 Additionally sales of regulatory credits increased by 580 million to 3603 million in the year ended December 31 2017 ZEV credits sales were 2797 million and nonZEV regulatory credits sales were 806 million in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to 2154 million ZEV credit sales and 869 million in nonZEV regulatory credit sales in the year ended December 31 2016 The increases were partially offset by additional deferrals of Autopilot 20 revenue in the year ended December 31 2017 Automotive leasing revenue increased 3448 million or 45 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 The increase was primarily due to an approximately 30 increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended December 31 2016 In addition during the year ended December 31 2017 we recognized an increase of 234 million of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and expiration of resale value guarantees as compared to the year ended December 31 2016 Service and other revenue increased 5332 million or 114 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This was primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sales as a result of increased automotive sales as well as from the expansion of our tradein program Additionally there was a 411 million increase from the inclusion of engineering service revenue from Grohmann Engineering GmbH now Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH which we acquired on January 3 2017 and a 684 million increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continued to grow during the year ended December 31 2017 56 Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sale of solar energy systems and energy storage products leasing revenue from solar energy systems under operating leases and PPAs and the sale of solar energy systems incentives 2018 Compared to 2017 Energy generation and storage revenue increased by 4390 million or 39 in the year ended December 31 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31 2017 The increase was primarily due to increases in deployments of Powerpack Powerwall and cash and loan solar energy systems projects The increase in Powerpack revenue was significant yearoveryear due to increases in revenue recognized for commercial projects most predominantly 812 million for the South Australia battery project Additionally we increased Powerwall production in the year ended December 31 2018 which helped us to continue to work through our energy storage order backlog 2017 Compared to 2016 Energy generation and storage revenue increased by 9349 million or 515 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 predominantly due to the inclusion of the fullyear of revenue from our solar business

Services and Other Segment Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services costs to acquire and certify used vehicles and costs for retail merchandise Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers 2018 Compared to 2017 Cost of automotive sales revenue increased 696 billion or 104 in the year ended December 31 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31 2017 The increase was primarily due to a significantly higher volume of Model 3 vehicles deliveries in 2018 and the recognition of 9698 million of additional cost of automotive sales revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard These increases were partially offset by significant reductions in Model 3 average costs per unit compared to the year ended December 31 2017 primarily due to temporary underutilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in 2017 and other cost efficiencies Additionally there were lower overall costs for Model S and Model X cash deliveries from approximately 3240 fewer units delivered yearoveryear and reductions in combined Model S and Model X average costs per unit as a result of increased manufacturing efficiencies Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased 2198 million or 31 in the year ended December 31 2018 compared to the year ended December 31 2017 The decrease was primarily due to a downward adjustment of 6244 million from the adoption of the new revenue standard partially offset by increased cost of automotive leasing revenue from an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs where our counterparty has retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period when compared to the year ended December 31 2017 When our counterparty retains ownership the net book value of the leased vehicle of the lease vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue Cost of services and other revenue increased 6513 million or 53 in the year ended December 31 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31 2017 The increase was primarily due to the increase in the cost of our new service centers additional service personnel in existing and new service centers Mobile Service capabilities parts distribution centers and investment in new body shops to provide maintenance services to our rapidly growing fleet of vehicles Additionally there was an overall increase in the cost of used vehicle sales from the increased volume of relatively lower priced nonTesla tradein vehicles These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of powertrain sales to another automobile manufacturer as we wound down the program in 2017 58 Gross margin for total automotive remained relatively consistent at 23 in the years ended December 31 2018 and 2017 There were increases from improved Model S and Model X combined margins as costs per unit decreased yearoveryear from continuing manufacturing efficiencies and an increase in regulatory credits sales which have no associated costs The increases were partially offset by margin dilution from Model 3 despite Model 3 margins improving yearoveryear The higher proportion of Model 3 as a percentage of our total automotive sales in the year ended December 31 2018 lowered our overall gross margin for total automotive as Model 3 had a lower annualized margin than Model S and Model X due to temporary underutilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes in the first half of 2018 and as we have yet to achieve significant manufacturing efficiencies in the production of Model 3 Gross margin for total automotive services and other segment remained relatively consistent at 19 in the years ended December 31 2018 and 2017 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above Services and other has historically operated at lower margins than our automotive sales and leasing business but has a small impact on the overall segment margin because of its relatively small revenue base 2017 Compared to 2016 Cost of automotive sales revenues increased 246 billion or 58 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This was primarily due to a 58 increase in vehicle deliveries resulting from increased sales of Model S and Model X as well as the commencement of deliveries of Model 3 in the third quarter of 2017 Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 2262 million or 47 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This was primarily due to an approximately 30 increase in the number of vehicles under leasing programs or programs with a resale value guarantee compared to the year ended December 31 2016 In addition during the year ended December 31 2017 we recognized an increase of 234 million in cost of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and the expiration of resale value guarantees Cost of services and other revenue increased 7566 million or 160 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 primarily due to the increase in cost of used vehicle sales due to increased volume and the increase in cost to provide maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 25 to 23 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 The commencement of deliveries of Model 3 in the third quarter of 2017 whereby the full operating costs and depreciation were recorded at much lower production volumes as production ramps and increases in early payoffs and expirations of resale value guarantees yearoveryear contributed to the lower gross margin Lower material and manufacturing costs for Model S and Model X as we further improved our vehicle production processes and the partial recognition of autopilot 20 revenue in the year ended December 31 2017 partially offset the overall decrease Gross margin for total automotive services and other segment decreased from 23 to 19 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 These decreases are driven by the factors impacting gross margin for total automotive as explained above as well as higher costs of maintenance service Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets In addition where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs 59 2018 Compared to 2017 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 4904 million or 56 in the year ended December 31 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31 2017 primarily due to increases in deployments of Powerpack Powerwall and cash and loan solar energy system projects The increase in Powerpack cost of revenue was significant yearoveryear due to increases in cost of revenue recognized for commercial projects most predominantly 725 million for the South Australia battery project Additionally costs for cash and loan solar energy system projects have increased from higher installation costs higher allocation of overhead costs from lower deployment of solar projects overall and certain warranty related onetime charges There were also higher costs for our solar energy system leasing arrangements due to impairment charges and higher costs from temporary manufacturing underutilization of our Solar Roof ramp Gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 22 to 12 in the year ended December 31 2018 compared to the year ended December 31 2017 The decrease was primarily due to the higher proportion of energy storage of our overall energy generation and storage portfolio due to a threefold growth of MWh of energy storage deployments in the year ended December 31 2018 Although energy storage margins have improved significantly as compared to the year ended December 31 2017 it continues to operate at a lower margin than our solar business thereby having a greater dilutive impact on our gross margin in the year ended December 31 2018 Additionally increases in costs for our cash and loan solar energy system projects impairment charges on solar energy system leasing arrangements and temporary manufacturing underutilization of our Solar Roof ramp have further contributed to the decrease in gross margin 2017 Compared to 2016 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 6962 million or 390 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This was primarily due to the inclusion of the fullyear of costs from our solar business which we gained by acquiring SolarCity on November 21 2016 Gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 2 to 22 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This was predominantly due to the inclusion of the fullyear of revenue and costs from our solar business which we gained by acquiring SolarCity Research and Development Expense Year Ended December 31 2018 vs 2017 Change 2017 vs 2016 Change Dollars in thousands 2018 2017 2016 Research and development 1460370

engineering and manufacturing test organizations prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense RD expenses increased 823 million or 6 in the year ended December 31 2018 compared to the year ended December 31 2017 This increase was primarily due to an 842 million increase in employee and labor related expenses from headcount growth to support our business expansion and 452 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants Additionally there was an increase of 160 million in facilities freight and depreciation expenses due to business expansion offset by a 697 million decrease in expensed materials as there were higher costs in the year ended December 31 2017 primarily related to Model 3 development 60 RD expenses increased 5437 million or 65 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended

million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated expenses and sales and marketing activities to support our business expansion SGA expenses increased 104 billion or 73 in the year ended December 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This increase was primarily due to a 5240 million increase in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount as a result of our acquisitions as well as headcount growth from the expansion of our automotive and energy generation and storage businesses and a 649 million increase in stockbased compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants Additionally the increase was due to a 3106 million increase in office information technology and facilitiesrelated expenses to support the growth of our business as well as sales and marketing activities to handle our expanding market presence and a 1406 million increase in professional and outside service expenses to support the growth of our business Restructuring and other Year Ended December 31 2018 vs 2017 Change 2017 vs 2016 Change Dollars in thousands

and recognized 366 million of employee termination expenses and estimated losses from subleasing a certain facility The employee termination cash expenses of 273 million were substantially paid by the end of 2018 while the remaining amounts were noncash Also included within restructuring and other activities was 552 million of expenses materially all of which were noncash from restructuring the energy generation and storage segment which comprised of disposals of certain tangible assets the shortening of the useful life of a trade name intangible asset and a contract termination penalty In addition we concluded that a small portion of the inprocess research and development asset is not commercially feasible Consequently we recognized an impairment loss of 133 million 61 In October 2018 a final court order was entered approving the terms of a settlement in connection with the SECs legal actions relating to Elon Musks prior consideration during the third quarter of 2018 of a takeprivate proposal for Tesla Consequently we recognized settlement and legal expenses of 301 million in the year ended December 31 2018 These expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018

December 31 2017 Additionally there was a decrease of 700 million in the amount of interest we capitalized from the consolidated statement of operations to property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets Lower capitalization results in higher interest expense The amount of interest we capitalize is driven by our construction in progress balance which decreased yearoveryear due to significant Model 3 capital expenditure ramp in the year ended December 31 2017 Interest expense increased by 2724 million or 137 in the year ended December 31 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31 2016 The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the fullyear of interest expense from SolarCity of 1855 million for the year ended December 31 2017 In addition our average outstanding indebtedness has increased in the year ended December 31 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31 2016 mainly due to the Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 and the Senior Notes due in 2025 both of which we issued during 2017 Other Income Expense Net Year Ended December 31 2018 vs 2017 Change 2017 vs 2016 Change Dollars in thousands 2018 2017 2016 Other income expense net 21866

currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates Other income expense net changed favorably by 1472 million to a gain of 219 million in the year ended December 31 2018 from a loss of 1254 million in the year ended December 31 2017 The change was primarily due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and gains from interest rate swaps related to our debt facilities yearoveryear Additionally we had 577 million of losses in the year ended December 31 2017 for measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair values of certain SolarCity liabilities as previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31 2016 with no corresponding expense in the year ended December 31 2018 Other income expense net changed unfavorably by 2367 million to a loss of 1254 million in the year ended December 31 2017 from a gain of 1113 million in the year ended December 31 2016 The decrease was primarily due to 577 million of losses in the year ended December 31 2017 for measurement period adjustments to the acquisition date fair value of SolarCity and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 62 Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended

taxes increased by 263 million or 83 in the year ended December 31 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31 2017 The increase was primarily due to the increase in taxable profits in certain foreign jurisdictions yearoveryear Our provision for income taxes increased by 49 million or 18 in the year ended December 31 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31 2016 This increase was primarily due to the increase in vehicle deliveries in foreign tax jurisdictions partially offset by 105 million of future US alternative minimum tax refunds as a result of the Tax Act which previously had an associated valuation allowance Net Income Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Year Ended December 31 2018 vs 2017 Change 2017 vs

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was related to financing fund arrangements Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31 2018 we had 369 billion of cash and cash equivalents Balances held in foreign currencies had a US dollar equivalent of 7490 million and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan euros and Japanese yen Our sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research and development projects for new products increases in Model 3 production capacity at the Tesla Factory the establishment of Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai the continued expansion of Gigafactory 1 the addition of manufacturing capacity for Model Y with the expectation to achieve volume production by the end of 2020 and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops Mobile Service fleet and Supercharger network We currently expect total 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately 25 billion 63 In 2019 we will continue to utilize our increasing experience and learnings from past and current product ramps to do so at a level of capital efficiency per dollar of spend that we expect to be significantly greater than historical levels For example based on our experience with ramping Model 3 at the Tesla Factory we expect that the capital spend per unit of Model 3 manufacturing capacity at Gigafactory Shanghai will be less than that of our line in Fremont Likewise based on such experience and the substantial commonality of components we expect between Model Y and Model 3 we believe that the production ramp of Model Y will be significantly faster than that of Model 3 and cost less per unit of manufacturing capacity than that of Model 3 at Fremont Considering the pipeline of new products planned at this point and consistent with our current strategy of using a partner to manufacture cells as well as considering all other infrastructure growth and expansion of Gigafactory 1 Gigafactory 2 and Gigafactory Shanghai we currently estimate that capital expenditures will be between 25 to 30 billion annually for the next two fiscal years Moreover we expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our nearterm debt obligations including the repayment of 9200 million for our 025 Convertible Senior Notes due on March 1 2019 although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources For example we expect that much of our investment in Gigafactory Shanghai will be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institutions in China As always we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business We have an agreement to spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10year period following full production at Gigafactory 2 We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at this facility and other operations within the State of New York and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months A large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings retail and service locations body shops Mobile Service fleet and Supercharger network We may need or want to raise additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them or at all If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected In addition we had 150 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of December 31 2018 some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables inventories leased vehicles and our interests in those leases solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts our interests in financing funds or various other assets and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds Upon the drawdown of any unused committed amounts there are no restrictions on the use of such funds for general corporate purposes For details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds refer to Note 13 LongTerm Debt Obligations and Note 18 Variable Interest Entity Arrangements

Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative and working capital especially inventory which includes vehicles in transit Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales lease payments directly from customers customer deposits sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process employee compensation operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings Net cash from operating activities changed favorably by 216 billion to net cash provided by operating activities of 210 billion during the year ended December 31 2018 from net cash used in operating activities of 607 million during the year ended December 31 2017 This favorable change was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and gains of 160 billion and the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 5546 million The decrease in net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of increased expenditures to support our ramp of Model 3 deliveries and a net decrease in operating lease vehicles and resale value guarantee liability primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue standard wherein certain vehicle sales to customer or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee were previously accounted for as an insubstance operating leases are now accounted for as sales with a right of return upon control transfer The increase in cash from certain operating activities was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and inventory as a result of increased Model 3 and energy products deliveries and production Additionally there was a decrease in customer deposits primarily due to Model 3 fulfillments and an increase in other assets as we paid 1413 million for the land use rights for Gigafactory Shanghai Net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31 2017 decreased by 632 million as compared to the year ended December 31 2016 due to the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 1973 million partially offset by the decrease in net loss excluding noncash expenses and gains of 1341 million The decrease in working capital was mainly driven by faster processing of payments for our vehicles and our focus on reducing inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017 During the year ended December 31 2016 cash used in operating activities was primarily a result of our net loss of 7730 million the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 7506 million as our business expanded the increase in resale value guarantees of 3269 million and deferred revenue of 3830 million as the number of vehicles with a resale value guarantee increased and the increase in customer deposits of 3884 million primarily due to Model 3 reservations These increases were partially offset by the increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of 247 billion as we expanded our program for direct leases and vehicles with a resale value guarantee Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures which were 232 billion during 2018 408 billion during 2017 and 144 billion during 2016 Capital expenditures during 2018 were 210 billion from purchases of property and equipment mainly for Model 3 production and the expansion of our customer support infrastructure and 2188 million for the design acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers 65 Capital expenditures during 2017 were 341 billion from purchases of property and equipment mainly for Model 3 production and 6665 million for the design acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers We also paid 1145 million net of the cash acquired for acquisitions in 2017 Capital expenditures during 2016 were 128 billion from purchases of property and equipment and 1597 million for the design acquisition and installation of solar energy systems under operating leases with customers These expenditures were partially offset by the assumed cash of 3427 million as a result of the SolarCity acquisition in 2016 In 2014 we began construction of Gigafactory 1 We used 6870 million 145 billion and 4553 million of cash towards Gigafactory 1 construction during the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31 2018 consisted primarily of 118 billion of net borrowings under automobile assetbacked notes 4310 million of net borrowings under the senior secured assetbased revolving credit agreement the Credit Agreement 3341 million from the issuance of solar assetbacked notes and 2957 million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and other stock issuances These cash inflows were partially offset by net repayments of 5819 million under our vehicle leasebacked loan and security agreements the Warehouse Agreements collateralized lease repayments of 5592 million repayments of 2300 million of the 275 Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1 2018 and repayments of 2102 million under the revolving aggregation

facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K 67 ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the US dollar primarily the euro Japanese yen Canadian dollar Chinese yuan and Norwegian krone In general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the US dollar for our foreign subsidiaries Accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the US dollar have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in US dollars We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income loss as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances For the year ended December 31 2018 we recognized a net foreign currency gain of 15 million in other income expense net with our largest remeasurement exposures from the euro New Taiwan dollar and Canadian dollar For the year ended December 31 2017 we recognized a net foreign currency loss of 523 million in other income expense net with our largest remeasurement exposures from the euro Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the nearterm These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income loss before income taxes These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact of 1757 million at December 31 2018 and 1160 million at December 31 2017 Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates Pursuant to our risk management policies in certain cases we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes A hypothetical 10 change in our interest rates would have increased our interest expense for the years ended December 31 2018 and 2017 by 85 million and 76 million respectively 68 I TEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Page Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 70

July 1 2003 We design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and design manufacture install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage products Our Chief Executive Officer as the chief operating decision maker CODM organizes the Company manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments i automotive and ii energy generation and storage Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 810 Consolidation we consolidate any variable interest entity VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary We form VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as VIEs through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of a number of VIEs see Note 18 Variable Interest Entity Arrangements We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation Reclassifications Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes as a result of the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update ASU 201618 Statement of Cash Flows Restricted Cash Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities and disclosures in the accompanying notes Estimates are used for but not limited to determining the transaction price of products and services in arrangements with multiple performance obligations and determining the amortization period of these obligations significant economic incentive for residual value guarantee arrangements sales return reserves the collectability of accounts receivable inventory valuation fair value of longlived assets goodwill fair value of financial instruments residual value of operating lease vehicles depreciable lives of property and equipment and solar energy systems fair value and residual value of solar energy systems subject to leases warranty liabilities income taxes contingencies the accrued liability for solar energy system performance guarantees determining lease passthrough financing obligations the discount rates used to determine the fair value of investment tax credits the valuation of buildtosuit lease assets fair value of interest rate swaps and inputs used to value stockbased compensation In addition estimates and assumptions are used for the accounting for business combinations including the fair values and useful lives of acquired assets assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities Actual results could differ from those estimates 77 Revenue Recognition Adoption of new accounting standards ASU 201409 Revenue Revenue from Contracts with Custome rs On January 1 2018 we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments new revenue standard using the modified retrospective method As a policy election the new revenue standard was applied only to contracts that were not substantially completed as of the date of adoption We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the January 1 2018 opening balance of accumulated deficit The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods A majority of our automotive sales revenue is recognized when control transfers upon delivery to customers For certain vehicle sales where revenue was previously deferred as an insubstance operating lease such as certain vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee we now recognize revenue when the vehicles are shipped as a sale with a right of return As a result the corresponding operating lease asset deferred revenue and resale value guarantee balances as of December 31 2017 were reclassified to accumulated deficit as part of our adoption entry Furthermore the warranty liability related to such vehicles has been accrued as a result of the change from insubstance operating leases to vehicle sales Prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties such as vehicle maintenance plans have been reclassified from deferred revenue to customer deposits Refer to the Automotive Revenue and Automotive Leasing Revenue sections below for further discussion of the impact on various categories of vehicle sales Following the adoption of the new revenue standard the revenue recognition for our other sales arrangements including sales of solar energy systems energy storage products services and sales of used vehicles remained consistent with our historical revenue recognition policy Under our lease passthrough fund arrangements we do not have any further performance obligations and therefore reclassified all investment tax credit ITC deferred revenue as of December 31 2017 to accumulated deficit as part of our adoption entry The corresponding effects of the changes to lease passthrough fund arrangements are also reflected in our noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries Additionally we have considered the impact from any new revenue arrangements in the current year that would have been accounted for differently under ASC 605 Revenue Recognition as an adjustment from adoption of the new revenue standard 78 Accordingly t he cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated January 1 2018 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the new revenue standard was as follows in thousands Balances at December 31 2017 Adjustments from

December 31 2018 was an increase in collateralized lease repayments of 4742 million from a net financing cash outflow of 849 million to a net financing cash outflow of 5592 million as presented with an offsetting increase to cash outflows from operations Additionally the adjustments to the consolidated balance sheet consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss identified above would have corresponding impacts within the operating section of the consolidated statement of cash flows Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard including access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity Autopilot full selfdriving and overtheair software updates We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eightyear life of the vehicle Revenue related to Autopilot and full selfdriving features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer For our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available 81 At the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns Such estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented In addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customers lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity Autopilot full selfdriving and overtheair software updates As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of revenues Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee We offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners Under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value With the exception of two programs which are discussed within the Automotive Leasing section we now recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicles estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customers economic incentive to exercise The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values The two programs that are still being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail below in Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option and Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all transactions with resale value guarantees were recorded as operating leases The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or was exercised For certain transactions that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840 Leases we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate The remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue The guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciated their value less estimated residual value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period In cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue If our counterparty returned the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory 82 Deferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity Autopilot full selfdriving and overtheair software updates on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the following in thousands Year Ended December 31 2018 Deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee beginning of period post adoption of new revenue standard 475919 Additions 532294 Net changes in liability for preexisting contracts 13248 Revenue recognized 112214 Deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee end of period 882751 Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of December 31 2018 From the deferred revenue balance as of January 1 2018 revenue recognized during the year ended December 31 2018 was 810 million Of the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees we expect to recognize 3267 million of revenue in the next 12 months The remaining balance will be recognized over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive Regulatory Credits California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zeroemission vehicles These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of zeroemission vehicles may earn regulatory credits ZEV credits and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require compliance related to greenhouse gas GHG emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers As a manufacturer solely of zeroemission vehicles we have earned emission credits such as ZEV and GHG credits on our vehicles and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future We enter into contractual agreements with thirdparties to purchase our regulatory credits Payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business We recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operations Revenue from the sale of regulatory credits totaled 4186 million 3603 million and 3023 million for the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively We had no deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits as of December 31 2018 and 2017 Automotive Leasing Revenue Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the two programs with resale value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all programs with resale value guarantees were accounted for as operating leases 83 Direct Vehicle Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in certain locations in the US Canada and Europe Currently the direct vehicle leasing program is only offered for new leases to qualified customers in the US and Canada Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months At the end of the lease term customers have the option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a predetermined residual value We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue For the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we recognized 3932 million 2206 million and 1127 million respectively As of December 31 2018 and 2017 we had deferred 1098 million and 966 million respectively of leaserelated upfront payments which will be recognized on a straightline basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases We capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions from the origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease agreement Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option We offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the United States These transactions entail a transfer of leases which we have originated with an endcustomer to our leasing partner As control of the vehicles has not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard these transactions continue to be accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840 Leases Under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within deferred revenue We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate We capitalize vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheet and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement Cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease repayments borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows At the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program should we decide to repurchase all vehicles was 4798 million as of December 31 2018 including 3098 million within a 12month period As of December 31 2018 we had 5583 million of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantees and 925 million recorded in deferred revenue liability For the year ended December 31 2018 we recognized 3324 million of leasing revenue related to this program On a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of these contracts As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values although we have not experienced any material losses during any period to date 84 Vehicle S ales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable For certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicles estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customers economic incentive to exercise We have not sold any vehicles under this program since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transactions The amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the payoff of the initial loan We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles net and depreciate their value less salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue If a customer returns the vehicle to us during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory As of December 31 2018 1497 million of the guarantees were exercisable by customers within the next 12 months For the year ended December 31 2018 we recognized 1579 million of leasing revenue related to this program Services and Other Revenue Services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles sales of electric vehicle components to other manufacturers retail merchandise and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers There were no significant changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a standready obligation to the customer We sell used vehicles services service plans vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations Payment for used vehicles services and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet Deferred revenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31 2018 and 2017 Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales Energy generation and storage revenues consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customers Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering design and installation of the system Post installation residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a standready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and accepted by the customer Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business 85 For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contractspecific phases of a project Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs Certain largescale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered to the customer for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets However any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirements specified in the contract In certain instances we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level Conversely if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements we may be required to pay liquidated damages Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur We record as deferred revenue any nonrefundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term As of December 31 2018 and 2017 deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to 1487 million and 1240 million respectively Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of January 1 2018 was 414 million for the year ended December 31 2018 We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less As of December 31 2018 total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was 1179 million Of this amount we expect to recognize 70 million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up to 30 years Energy Generation and Storage Leasing For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 86 For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under power purchase agreements PPAs we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840 Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term As of December 31 2018 and 2017 deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to 2254 million and 2068 million respectively Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which is recognized as revenue over the lease term As of December 31 2018 and December 31 2017 deferred revenue from rebates and incentives amounted to 368 million and 272 million respectively We capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system leases or PPAs which include the incremental cost of contract administration referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems leased and to be leased net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease or PPA Revenue by source The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source in thousands Year Ended December 31 2018 Automotive sales without resale value guarantee 15809890 Automotive sales with resale value guarantee 1403014 Automotive regulatory credits 418618 Energy generation and storage sales 1056543 Services and other 1391041 Total revenues from sales and services 20079106 Automotive leasing 883461 Energy generation and storage leasing 498701 Total revenues 21461268 Cost of Revenues Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand Automotive Leasing Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term as well as warranty expenses recognized as incurred Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs Services and Other Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services costs to acquire and certify used vehicles and costs for retail merchandise Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other manufacturers and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers 87 Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Energy generation and storage cost of revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets In addition where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred Marketing Promotional and Advertising Costs Marketing promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations We incurred marketing promotional and advertising costs of 700 million 665 million and 480 million in the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively Income Taxes Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense Comprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss Other comprehensive income loss consists of unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges and availableforsale marketable securities and foreign currency translation adjustments that have been excluded from the determination of net income loss StockBased Compensation We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all sharebased payments including stock options restricted stock units RSUs and our employee stock purchase plan the ESPP The fair value of stock option awards with only service conditions and the ESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using the BlackScholes optionpricing model The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock Stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period net of actual forfeitures in the period prior to 2017 net of estimated projected forfeitures Stockbased compensation associated with awards assumed from the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation SolarCity is measured as of the acquisition date using the relevant assumptions and recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining requisite service period net of actual forfeitures in the period prior to 2017 net of estimated projected forfeitures 88 For performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable For performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations see Note 15 Equity Incentive Plans As we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods Stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements We have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value HLBV method We therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries Under the HLBV method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the thirdparties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the thirdparties The thirdparties interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the thirdparties However the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these thirdparties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets Net Income Loss per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders Basic net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income loss attributable to common stockholders by the weightedaverage shares of common stock outstanding for the period Potentially dilutive shares which are based on the weightedaverage shares of common stock underlying outstanding stockbased awards warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the ifconverted method as applicable are included when calculating diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive Since we intend to settle in cash the principal outstanding under the 025 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 the 125 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021 and the 2375 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 we use the treasury stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect if any Furthermore in connection with the offerings of our bond hedges we entered into convertible note hedges see Note 13 LongTerm Debt Obligations However our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always antidilutive 89 The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders because their effect was antidilutive Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Stockbased awards 9928789 10456363 12091473 Convertible senior notes 1432656 2315463 841191 Warrants 214213 579137 262702 Business Combinations We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805 Business Combinations The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred Identifiable assets including intangible assets liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents Our cash equivalents are primarily comprised of money market funds Restricted Cash We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash as collateral for our sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee letters of credit real estate leases insurance policies credit card borrowing facilities and certain operating leases In addition restricted cash includes cash received from certain fund investors that have not been released for use by us and cash held to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities The following table totals cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported on the consolidated balance sheets the sums are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 2018 2017 2016 2015 Cash and cash equivalents 3685618 3367914 3393216 1196908 Restricted cash 1 192551 155323 105519 5961 Restricted cash net of current portion 398219 441722 268165 31522 Total as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 4276388 3964959 3766900 1234391 1 In the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 2015 the restricted cash and marketable securities balance of 226 million included 167 million of marketable securities This balance of marketable securities has been excluded in the table above 90 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to sales of powertrain systems sales of energy generation and storage products receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies We provide an allowance against accounts receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected We writeoff accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible We typically do not carry significant accounts receivable related to our vehicle and related sales as customer payments are due prior to vehicle delivery except for amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved financing arrangements between our customers and the financial institutions MyPower Customer Notes Receivable We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program MyPower was offered by SolarCity to provide residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30year loan The outstanding balances net of any allowance for potentially uncollectible amounts are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as MyPower customer notes receivable net of current portion for the longterm portion In determining the allowance and credit quality for customer notes receivable we identify significant customers with known disputes or collection issues and also consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses Customer notes receivable that are individually impaired are chargedoff as a writeoff of the allowance for losses Since acquisition there have been no new significant customers with known disputes or collection issues and the amount of potentially uncollectible amounts has been insignificant In addition there were no material nonaccrual or past due customer notes receivable as of December 31 2018 Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash cash equivalents restricted cash accounts receivable convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the US These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits As of December 31 2018 and 2017 no entity represented 10 or more of our total accounts receivable balance The risk of concentration for our interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highlyrated multinational banks Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are single source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis In addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost We record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and future demand forecasts If our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product Once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 91 Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results Operating Lease Vehicles Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program vehicles delivered to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option as well as vehicles delivered to customers with resale value guarantee where exercise is probable are classified as operating lease vehicles as the related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases refer to the Automotive Leasing Revenue section above for details Operating lease vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the expected operating lease term The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31 2018 and 2017 was 255 billion and 485 billion respectively Accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicles as of December 31 2018 and 2017 was 4576 million and 7333 million respectively Solar Energy Systems Leased and To Be Leased We are the lessor of solar energy systems under leases that qualify as operating leases Our leases are accounted for in accordance with ASC 840 To determine lease classification we evaluate the lease terms to determine whether there is a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease whether the lease term is greater than 75 of the useful life or whether the present value of the minimum lease payments exceed 90 of the fair value at lease inception We utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful lives and fair values at lease inception and residual values at lease termination Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows Solar energy systems leased to customers 30 to 35 years Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs Lease term up to 25 years Solar energy systems held for lease to customers are installed systems pending interconnection with the respective utility companies and will be depreciated as solar energy systems leased to customers when they have been interconnected and placed inservice Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation which will be depreciated as solar energy systems leased to customers when they are completed interconnected and leased to customers Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer lease agreements Property Plant and Equipment Property plant and equipment including leasehold improvements are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation is generally computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows Machinery equipment vehicles and office furniture 2 to 12 years Building and building improvements 15 to 30 years Computer equipment and software 3 to 10 years Depreciation for tooling is computed using the unitsofproduction method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life of the respective assets As of December 31 2018 the estimated productive life for Model S and Model X tooling was 325000 vehicles based on our current estimates of production As of December 31 2018 the estimated productive life for Model 3 tooling was 1000000 vehicles based on our current estimates of production 92 Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straightline basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases Upon the retirement or sale of our property plant and equipment the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction Capitalized interest on constructioninprogress is included within property plant and equipment and is amortized over the life of the related assets Furthermore we are deemed to be the owner for accounting purposes during the construction phase of certain longlived assets under buildtosuit lease arrangements because of our involvement with the construction our exposure to any potential cost overruns or our other commitments under the arrangements In these cases we recognize buildtosuit lease assets under construction and corresponding buildtosuit lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 840 Once construction is completed if a lease meets certain saleleaseback criteria we remove the asset and liability and account for the lease as an operating lease Otherwise the lease is accounted for as a capital lease LongLived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets We review our property plant and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate If the asset is not recoverable its carrying amount would be adjusteddown to its fair value For the year ended December 31 2018 we have recognized certain material impairments of our longlived assets refer to Note 4 Intangible Assets for further details For the years ended December 31 2017 and 2016 we have recognized no material impairments of our longlived assets Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives which range from two to thirty years Capitalization of Software Costs For costs incurred in development of internal use software we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage Costs related to preliminary project activities and postimplementation activities are expensed as incurred Internal use software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life of three to ten years We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets Foreign Currency We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in which they operate In cases where the functional currency is not the US dollar we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to accumulated deficits including current period income or loss and the balance sheet For each subsidiary we apply the monthly average functional currency rate to its income or loss and the monthend functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations For the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we recorded foreign currency transaction gains of 15 million losses of 523 million and gains of 261 million respectively 93 Warranties We provide a manufacturers warranty on all new and used vehicles production powertrain components and systems and energy storage products we sell In addition we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet Due to the adoption of the new revenue standard automotive sales with resale value guarantees that were previously recorded within operating lease assets require a corresponding warranty accrual which is included in the table below Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following in thousands Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Accrued warrantybeginning of period 401790 266655 180754 Assumed warranty liability from acquisition 4737 31366 Warranty costs incurred 209124 122510 79147 Net changes in liability for preexisting warranties including expirations and foreign exchange impact 26294 4342 20084 Additional warranty accrued from adoption of the new revenue standard 37139 Provision for warranty 544315 248566 153766 Accrued warrantyend of period 747826 401790 266655 For the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 warranty costs incurred for vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements were 219 million 355 million and 190 million respectively Solar Energy System Performance Guarantees We guarantee a specified minimum solar energy production output for certain solar energy systems leased or sold to customers generally for a term of up to 30 years We monitor the solar energy systems to ensure that these outputs are being achieved We evaluate if any amounts are due to our customers and make any payments periodically as specified in the customer agreements As of December 31 2018 and 2017 we had recognized a liability of 75 million and 63 million respectively within accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets related to these guarantees based on our assessment of the exposures Solar Renewable Energy Credits We account for solar renewable energy credits SRECs when they are purchased by us or sold to thirdparties For SRECs generated by solar energy systems owned by us and minted by government agencies we do not recognize any specifically identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental costs incurred to generate the SRECs For SRECs purchased by us we record these SRECs at their cost subject to impairment testing We recognize revenue from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer and the cost of the SREC if any is then recorded to cost of revenue 94 Deferred Investment Tax Credit Revenue We have solar energy systems that are eligible for ITCs that accrue to eligible property under the Internal Revenue Code IRC Under Section 50d5 of the IRC and the related regulations a lessor of qualifying property may elect to treat the lessee as the owner of such property for the purposes of claiming the ITCs associated with such property These regulations enable the ITCs to be separated from the ownership of the property and allow the transfer of the ITCs Under our lease passthrough fund arrangements we can make a tax election to passthrough the ITCs to the investors who are the legal lessee of the property Therefore we are able to monetize these ITCs to the investors who can utilize them in return for cash payments We consider the monetization of ITCs to constitute one of the key elements of realizing the value associated with solar energy systems Consequently we consider the proceeds from the monetization of ITCs to be a component of revenue generated from solar energy systems In accordance with the relevant FASB guidance we recognize revenue from the monetization of ITCs when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 3 the sales price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured An ITC is subject to recapture under the IRC if the underlying solar energy system either ceases to be a qualifying property or undergoes a change in ownership within five years of its placedinservice date the recapture amount decreases on each anniversary of the placedinservice date Since we have an obligation to ensure that the solar energy system is inservice and operational for a term of five years in order to avoid any recapture of the ITC we recognize revenue as the recapture amount decreases assuming the other revenue recognition criteria above have been met As a result the monetized ITC is initially recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets and subsequently onefifth of the monetized ITC is recognized as energy generation and storage revenue on the consolidated statement of operations on each anniversary of the solar energy systems placedinservice date over five years As discussed in the Revenue Recognition section above following the adoption of the new revenue standard on January 1 2018 we no longer defer the monetized ITC as deferred revenue outstanding and have reclassified all ITC deferred revenue as of December 31 2017 to our opening accumulated deficit We indemnify the investors for any recapture of ITCs due to our noncompliance We have concluded that the likelihood of a recapture event is remote and consequently we have not recognized a liability for this indemnification on the consolidated balance sheets Nevada Tax Incentives We have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for sales use real property personal property and employer excise taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits These incentives are available for the applicable periods beginning on October 17 2014 and ending on either June 30 2024 or June 30 2034 depending on the incentive Under these agreements we were eligible for a maximum of 1950 million of transferable tax credits subject to capital investments by us and our partners for Gigafactory 1 of at least 350 billion which we exceeded during 2017 and specified hiring targets for Gigafactory 1 which we exceeded during 2018 We record these credits as earned when we have evidence there is a market for their sale Credits are applied as a cost offset to either employee expense or to capital assets depending on the source of the credits Credits earned from employee hires or capital spending by our partners at Gigafactory 1 are recorded as a reduction to operating expenses As of December 31 2018 and 2017 we had earned 1950 million and 1630 million of transferable tax credits under these agreements respectively 95 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU No 201409 Revenue from Contracts with Customers to replace the existing revenue recognition criteria for contracts with customers In August 2015 the FASB issued ASU No 201514 Deferral of the Effective Date to defer the effective date of ASU No 201409 to interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 Subsequently the FASB issued ASU No 201608 Principal versus Agent Considerations ASU No 201610 Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing ASU No 201611 Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 201409 and 201416 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3 2016 EITF Meeting ASU No 201612 NarrowScope Improvements and Practical Expedients and ASU No 201620 Technical Corrections and Improvements to clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No 201409 We adopted the ASUs on January 1 2018 on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit The adoption of the ASUs changed the timing of revenue recognition to be at delivery for certain vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee which now qualify to be accounted for as sales with a right of return as opposed to the prior accounting as operating leases or collateralized lease borrowings Upon adoption of the ASUs we recorded a decrease to our beginning accumulated deficit of 6232 million including income tax effects which were immaterial Refer to the Revenue Recognition section above for details In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201602 Leases to require lessees to recognize all leases with limited exceptions on the balance sheet while recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to current lease accounting The ASU also eliminates real estatespecific provisions and modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting Subsequently the FASB issued ASU No 201810 Codification Improvements to Topic 842 ASU No 201811 Targeted Improvements and ASU No 201820 NarrowScope Improvements for Lessors to clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No 201602 The ASUs are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2018 with early adoption permitted We will adopt the ASUs on January 1 2019 on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative adjustment to our beginning accumulated deficit balance Prior comparative periods will not be restated under this method and we will adopt all available practical expedients as applicable Further solar leases that commence on or after January 1 2019 where we are the lessor and which are currently accounted for as leases will no longer meet the definition of a lease Instead solar leases commencing on or after January 1 2019 will be accounted for under ASC 606 In addition to recognizing operating leases that were previously not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet we also expect most of our buildtosuit leases to be derecognized with a net decrease of approximately of 1000 million to our beginning accumulated deficit before income tax effects as our buildtosuit leases will no longer qualify for buildtosuit accounting and will instead be recognized as operating leases or finance leases Upon adoption our consolidated balance sheet will include an overall reduction in assets in the range of approximately 4000 million to 5000 million and a reduction in liabilities in the range of approximately 5000 million to 6000 million The ASUs are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated statement of operations or the consolidated statement of cash flows In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201613 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments to require financial assets carried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical experience current conditions and forecasts Subsequently the FASB issued ASU No 201819 Codification Improvements to Topic 326 to clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting standards The ASUs are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2019 with early adoption permitted Adoption of the ASUs is modified retrospective We are currently obtaining an understanding of the ASUs and plan to adopt them on January 1 2020 In August 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201615 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments to reduce the diversity in practice with respect to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 Adoption of the ASU is retrospective We adopted the ASU on January 1 2018 which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements In November 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201618 Statement of Cash Flows Restricted Cash which requires entities to present the aggregate changes in cash cash equivalents restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows As a result the statement of cash flows now presents restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as a part of the beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 Adoption of the ASU is retrospective We adopted the ASU on January 1 2018 which resulted in restricted cash being combined with unrestricted cash reconciling beginning and ending balances Refer to the Restricted Cash section for the reconciliation 96 In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 201701 Clarifying the Definition of a Business to clarify which transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 Adoption of the ASU is prospective We adopted the ASU on January 1 2018 which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 201704 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 An entity will therefore perform the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2019 with early adoption permitted Adoption of the ASU is prospective We have not yet selected an adoption date though the ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements In February 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 201705 Gains and Losses from the Recognition of Nonfinancial Assets to clarify the scope of asset derecognition guidance and accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 We adopted the ASU on January 1 2018 on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit Upon adoption of the ASU we recorded a 94 million decrease to our beginning accumulated deficit balance In May 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 201709 Scope of Modification Accounting to provide guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a sharebased payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2017 Adoption of the ASU is prospective We adopted the ASU on January 1 2018 which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements In August 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 201712 Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities to simplify the application of current hedge accounting guidance The ASU expands and refines hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components and aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2018 with early adoption permitted Adoption of the ASU will be prospective for us We plan to adopt the ASU on January 1 2019 and the ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements In January 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 201801 Land Easement Practical Expedient Transition to Topic 842 to permit an entity to elect a practical expedient to not reevaluate land easements that existed or expired before the entitys adoption of ASU No 201602 Leases and that are not currently accounted for as leases The ASU is effective for the same periods as ASU No 201602 and the ASU will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements In August 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 201815 Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that Is a Service Contract The ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internaluse software and hosting arrangements that include an internaluse software license The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2019 with early adoption permitted Adoption of the ASU is either retrospective or prospective We are currently obtaining an understanding of the ASU and plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on January 1 2020 Note 3 Business Combinations Grohmann Acquisition On January 3 2017 we completed our acquisition of Grohmann Engineering GmbH now Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH or Grohmann which specializes in the design development and sale of automated manufacturing systems for 1095 million in cash We acquired Grohmann to improve the speed and efficiency of our manufacturing processes 97 At the time of acquisition we entered into an incentive compensation arrangement for up to a maximum of 258 million of payments contingent upon continued service with us for 36 months after the acquisition date Such payments would have been accounted for as compensation expense in the periods earned However during the three months ended March 31 2017 we terminated the incentive compensation arrangement and accelerated the payments thereunder As a result we recorded the entire 258 million as compensation expense in the three months ended March 31 2017 which was included within selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives and the expected future cash flows and related discount rates can materiality impact our results of operations Significant inputs used included the amount of cash flows the expected period of the cash flows and the discount rates During the fourth quarter of 2017 we finalized our estimate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed Prior to finalization there were no changes to the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed The allocation of the purchase consideration was based on managements estimate of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as follows in thousands Assets acquired Cash and cash equivalents 334 Accounts receivable 42947 Inventory 10031 Property plant and equipment 44030 Intangible assets 21723 Prepaid expenses and other assets current and noncurrent

liabilities assumed 51647 Net assets acquired 69416 Goodwill 40065 Total purchase price 109481 Goodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and was primarily attributable to the expected synergies from potential monetization opportunities and from integrating Grohmanns technology into our automotive business as well as the acquired talent Goodwill is not deductible for US income tax purposes and is not amortized Rather we assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired by comparing its carrying value to the reporting units fair value 98 Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired The determination of the fair values of

outstanding share of SolarCity common stock was converted into 0110 the Exchange Ratio shares of our common stock In addition SolarCitys stock option awards and restricted stock unit awards were assumed by us and converted into corresponding equity awards in respect of our common stock based on the Exchange Ratio with the awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the acquisition Fair Value of Purchase Consideration The Acquisition Date fair value of the purchase consideration was as follows in thousands except for share and per

SolarCity awards 87500 Total purchase price 2145977 Furthermore the assumed unvested SolarCity awards of 959 million are recognized as stockbased compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period Per ASC 805 the replacement of stock options or other sharebased payment awards in conjunction with a business combination represents a modification of sharebased payment awards that must be accounted for in accordance with ASC 718 Stock Compensation As a result of our issuance of replacement awards a portion of the fairvaluebased measure of the replacement awards is included in the purchase consideration To determine the portion of the replacement awards that is part of the purchase consideration we measured the fair value of both the replacement awards and the historical awards as of the Acquisition Date The fair value of the replacement awards whether vested or unvested was included in the purchase consideration to the extent that preacquisition services were rendered Transaction costs of 217 million were expensed as incurred to selling general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations 99 Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives and the expected future cash flows and related discount rates can materiality impact our results of operations Specifically we utilized a discounted cash flow model to value the acquired solar energy systems leased and to be leased as well as the noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries Significant inputs used included the amount of cash flows the expected period of the cash flows and the discount rates The allocation of the purchase consideration was based on managements estimate of the Acquisition Date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as follows in thousands Assets acquired Cash and cash equivalents 213523 Accounts receivable

purchase price 2145977 Gain on Acquisition Since the fair value of the net assets acquired was greater than the purchase price we recognized a gain on acquisition of 887 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 which was recorded within other income expense net on the consolidated statements of operations During the fourth quarter of 2017 we finalized our estimate of the Acquisition Date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed Prior to finalization during the year ended December 31 2017 we recorded an 116 million measurement period adjustment to MyPower customer notes receivable net of current portion and a 462 million measurement period adjustment to accrued liabilities The measurement period adjustments were recorded as losses to other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations and reduced the gain on acquisition initially recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 100 Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired The determination of the fair

associated research and development efforts If the research and development efforts are successfully completed and commercial feasibility is reached the IPRD would be amortized over its then estimated useful life If the research and development efforts are not completed or are abandoned the IPRD might be impaired The fair value of the IPRD was estimated using the replacement cost method under the cost approach based on the historical acquisition costs and expenses of the technology adjusted for estimated developers profit opportunity cost and obsolescence factor During the year ended December 31 2018 we concluded that a portion of the IPRD was not commercially feasible and consequently recognized an abandonment loss of 133 million in restructuring and other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations Additionally 265 million of IPRD was put into production during the year ended December 31 2018 and we expect to complete the remaining research and development efforts in the first half of 2019 The nature of the research and development efforts consists principally of planning designing and testing the technology for viability in manufacturing solar cells and modules If commercial feasibility is not achieved for the remaining IPRD we would likely look to other alternative technologies The costs associated with one of the trade names acquired by us has been fully amortized as of December 31 2018 as we phased out the use of such trade name in our sales and marketing efforts Total future amortization expense for intangible assets was estimated as follows in thousands December 31 2018 2019 34637 2020 32729 2021 32729 2022 32729 2023 26537 Thereafter 76105 Total 235466 102 Note 5 Fair Value of Financial Instruments ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements states that fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants As such fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability The threetiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value is comprised of Level I observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets Level II inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and Level III unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows in thousands December 31 2018 December 31 2017 Fair Value

Total 1823898 1812828 11070 2163518 2163459 59 All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets Our interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using alternative pricing sources or models that utilized market observable inputs including current and forward interest rates During the year ended December 31 2018 there were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy Interest Rate Swaps We enter into fixedforfloating interest rate swap agreements to swap variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments as required by certain of our lenders We do not designate our interest rate swaps as hedging instruments Accordingly our interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets within other assets or other longterm liabilities with any changes in their fair values recognized as other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations and with any cash flows recognized as investing activities in the consolidated statements of

we commence transferring component parts from inventory to construction in progress a component of solar energy systems leased and to be leased once a lease contract with a customer has been executed and installation has been initiated Additional costs incurred on the leased systems including labor and overhead are recorded within construction in progress We writedown inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying value During the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we recorded writedowns of 783

revenue standard automotive sales with resale value guarantees that are now accounted for as sales with a right of return require a corresponding sales return reserve which is included in accrued liabilities and other when the reserve is current and other longterm liabilities when the reserve is noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets For automotive sales without a resale value guarantee

of the 2018 Notes is initially convertible into 80306 shares of our common stock which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of 12452 per share subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events Holders of the 2018 Notes may convert at their option on or after March 1 2018 Further holders of the 2018 Notes may convert at their option prior to March 1 2018 only under the

date holders of the 2018 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2018 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest In addition if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2018 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2018 Notes We recorded to stockholders equity 828 million for the conversion feature The resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 429 In connection with the offering of

pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options by the underwriters The total net proceeds from the issuances after deducting transaction costs were 9058 million for the 2019 Notes and

conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances As of December 31 2018 none of the conditions permitting the holders of 2021 Notes to early convert had been met Therefore 2021 Notes were classified as longterm In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features we initially valued and bifurcated the conversion features associated with these notes We recorded to stockholders equity 1881 million for the 2019 Notes conversion feature and 3694 million for the 2021 Notes conversion feature The resulting debt

275 Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1 2018 in a public offering Each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 17838 shares of our common stock which is equivalent to a conversion price of 56064 per share subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to dividends tender offers or exchange offers Holders of the convertible senior notes may convert at their option at any time up to and including the second trading day prior to the maturity date If certain events that would constitute a makewhole fundamental change such as significant changes in ownership corporate structure or tradability of our common stock occur prior to the maturity date we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its convertible senior notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances The maximum conversion rate is capped at 23635 shares for each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of 42310 per share The convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option The convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes In November 2018 the 275 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018 matured and aggregate outstanding principal of 2300 million was fully paid off 1625 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 In September 2014 SolarCity issued 5000 million and in October 2014 SolarCity issued an additional 660 million in aggregate principal amount of 1625 Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1 2019 in a private placement Each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 13169 shares of our common stock which is equivalent to a conversion price of 75936 per share subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to dividends tender offers or exchange offers The maximum conversion rate is capped at 17449 shares for each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of 57310 per share The convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option The convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes In connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in September and October 2014 SolarCity entered into capped call option agreements to reduce the potential dilution upon the conversion of the convertible senior notes Specifically upon the exercise of the capped call options we would now receive shares of our common stock equal to 745377 shares multiplied by a i the lower of 114618 or the then market price of our common stock less ii 75936 and divided by b the then market price of our common stock The results of this formula are that we would receive more shares as the market price of our common stock exceeds 75936 and approaches 114618 but we would receive less shares as the market price of our common stock exceeds 114618 Consequently if the convertible senior notes are converted then the number of shares to be issued by us would be effectively partially offset by the shares received by us under the capped call options We can also elect to receive the equivalent value of cash in lieu of shares The capped call options expire on various dates ranging from September 4 2019 to October 29 2019 and the formula above would be adjusted in the event of a merger a tender offer nationalization insolvency delisting of our common stock changes in law failure to deliver insolvency filing stock splits combinations dividends repurchases or similar events or an announcement of certain of the preceding actions Although intended to reduce the net number of shares issued after a conversion of the convertible senior notes the capped call options were separately negotiated transactions are not a part of the terms of the convertible senior notes do not affect the rights of the convertible senior note holders and take effect regardless of whether the convertible senior notes are actually converted The capped call options meet the criteria for equity classification because they are indexed to our common stock and we always control whether settlement will be in shares or cash 113 ZeroCoupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020 In December 2015 SolarCity issued 1130 million in aggregate principal amount of ZeroCoupon Convertible Senior Notes due on December 1 2020 in a private placement 130 million of the convertible senior notes were issued to related parties see Note 21 Related Party Transactions Each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 33333 shares of our common stock which is equivalent to a conversion price of 30000 per share subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events related to dividends tender offers or exchange offers The maximum conversion rate is capped at 42308 shares for each 1000 of principal of the convertible senior notes which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of 23636 per share The convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option The convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes On or after June 30 2017 the convertible senior notes are redeemable by us in the event that the closing price of our common stock exceeds 200 of the conversion price for 45 consecutive trading days ending within three trading days of such redemption notice at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus any accrued and

fair value method in recognizing stockbased compensation expense Under the fair value method we estimate the fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the BlackScholes option pricing model and the weightedaverage assumptions in the following table Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Riskfree interest rate Stock options 25 18 15 ESPP 20 11 06 Expected term in years Stock options 47 51 62 ESPP 05 05 05 Expected volatility Stock options 42 42 47 ESPP 43 35 41 Dividend yield Stock options 00 00 00 ESPP 00 00 00 Grant date fair value per share Stock options 12192 12225 9870 ESPP 8437 7505 5131 The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock The riskfree interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield for zerocoupon US Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grants expected life Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017 given our then limited history with employee grants we used the simplified method in estimating the expected term of our employee grants the simplified method utilizes the average of the timetovesting and the contractual life of the employee grant Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017 we use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock 122 2018 CEO Performance Award In March 2018 our stockholders approved the Board of Directors grant of 20264042 stock option awards to our CEO the 2018 CEO Performance Award The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both i the market capitalization milestone for such tranche which begins at 100 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of 50 billion thereafter and ii any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on revenue or eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been met for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income loss attributable to common stockholders before interest expense provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation Total Annualized Revenue in billions Annualized Adjusted EBITDA in billions 200 15 350 30 550 45 750 60 1000 80 1250 100 1500 120 1750 140 As of December 31 2018 the following operational milestones were considered probable of achievement Total revenue of 200 billion Adjusted EBITDA of 15 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of 30 billion Stockbased compensation expense associated with the 2018 CEO Performance Award is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for each pair of market capitalization or operational milestones beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being met If additional operational milestones become probable stockbased compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catchup expense for the service provided since the grant date The market capitalization milestone period and the valuation of each tranche are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and is used as the basis for determining the expected achievement period The probability of meeting an operational milestone is based on a subjective assessment of our future financial projections Even though no tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vest unless a market capitalization and a matching operational milestone are both achieved stockbased compensation expense is recognized only when an operational milestone is considered probable of achievement regardless of how much additional market capitalization must be achieved in order for a tranche to vest At our current market capitalization even the first tranche of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will not vest unless our market capitalization were to approximately double from the current level and stay at that increased level for a sustained period of time Additionally stockbased compensation represents a noncash expense and is recorded as a selling general and administrative operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations As of December 31 2018 we had 5980 million of total unrecognized stockbased compensation expense for the operational milestones that were considered probable of achievement which will be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 31 years As of December 31 2018 we had unrecognized stockbased compensation expense of 151 billion for the operational milestones that were considered not probable of achievement From March 21 2018 when the grant was approved by our stockholders through December 31 2018 we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 1749 million related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award 123 2014 PerformanceBased Stock Option Awards In 2014 to create incentives for continued longterm success beyond the Model S program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders interests in the achievement of significant milestones by us the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted stock option awards to certain employees excluding our CEO to purchase an aggregate of 1073000 shares of our common stock Each award consisted of the following four vesting tranches with the vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the future performance milestones assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date 14th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model X production vehicle 14th of each award vests upon achieving aggregate production of 100000 vehicles in a trailing 12month period 14th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle and 14th of each award vests upon achieving an annualized gross margin of greater than 30 for any threeyear period As of December 31 2018 the following performance milestones had been achieved Completion of the first Model X production vehicle Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle and Aggregate production of 100000 vehicles in a trailing 12month period We begin recognizing stockbased compensation expense as each performance milestone becomes probable of achievement As of December 31 2018 we had unrecognized stockbased compensation expense of 109 million for the performance milestone that was considered not probable of achievement For the year ended December 31 2018 we did not record any additional stockbased compensation related to these awards For the years ended December 2017 and 2016 we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 68 million and 253 million respectively related to these awards 2012 CEO Performance Award In August 2012 our Board of Directors granted 5274901 stock option awards to our CEO the 2012 CEO Performance Award The 2012 CEO Performance Award consists of 10 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date Each vesting tranche requires a combination of a predetermined performance milestone and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of 400 billion as compared to our initial market capitalization of 320 billion at the time of grant As of December 31 2018 the market capitalization conditions for all of the vesting tranches and the following performance milestones had been achieved Successful completion of the Model X alpha prototype

recognizing stockbased compensation expense as each milestone becomes probable of achievement As of December 31 2018 we had unrecognized stockbased compensation expense of 57 million for the performance milestone that was considered not probable of achievement For the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 01 million 51 million and 158 million respectively related to the 2012 CEO Grant Our CEO earns a base salary that reflects the currently applicable minimum wage requirements under California law and he is subject to income taxes based on such base salary However he has never accepted and currently does not accept his salary Summary StockBased Compensation Information The following table summarizes our stockbased compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations in thousands Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Cost of revenues 85742 43845 30400 Research and development 261079 217616 154632

any plan limitations The purchase price would be 85 of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of each sixmonth offering period During the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 we issued 399936 370173 and 321788 shares under the ESPP for 1088 million 710 million and 517 million respectively There were 2023954 shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31 2018 Note 16 Income Taxes A provision for income taxes of 578 million 315 million and 267 million has been recognized for the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively related primarily to our subsidiaries located outside of the US Our loss before provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 was as follows in thousands Year Ended

for income taxes 57837 31546 26698 On December 22 2017 the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act was enacted into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code Changes include but are not limited to a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after December 31 2017 the transition of US international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings We were required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as remeasuring our US deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net US deferred tax assets In December 2017 the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act SAB 118 which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date As such in accordance with SAB 118 we completed our analysis during the fourth quarter of 2018 considering current legislation and guidance resulting in no material adjustments from the provisional amounts recorded during the prior year 126 Deferred tax assets liabilities as of December 31 2018 and 2017 consisted of the following in thousands December 31 December 31 2018 2017 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryforwards 1759716 1575952 Research and development credits 376556 306808 Other tax

tax assets 7947 23609 As of December 31 2018 we recorded a valuation allowance of 181 billion for the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes decreased by 381 million increased by 8210 million and increased by 3543 million during the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to additional US deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year The 2017 additional US deferred tax assets are net of remeasurement from 35 to 21 as a result of the Tax Act There have been no material releases of the valuation allowance Management believes that based on the available information it is more likely than not that the US deferred tax assets will not be realized such that a full valuation allowance is required against all US deferred tax assets We have net 302 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions which management believes are morelikelythannot to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions 127 The reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 2018 2017 and 2016 was as follows in thousands Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Tax at statutory federal rate 210996 773162 261222 State tax net of federal benefit 2792 2029 568 Nondeductible expenses 65375 30138 26547 Excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation 1 43977 1013196 Foreign income rate differential 160370 364699 206470 US

Other reconciling items 960 3178 785 Change in valuation allowance 131020 718584 225506 Provision for income taxes 57837 31546 26698 1 As of January 1 2017 upon the adoption of ASU No 201609 Improvements to Employee Sharebased Payment Accounting excess tax benefits from sharebased award activity incurred from the prior and current years are reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes The excess tax benefits result in an increase to our gross US deferred tax assets that is offset by a corresponding increase to our valuation allowance 2 Due to the Tax Act our US deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 2017 were remeasured from 35 to 21 The change in tax rate resulted in a decrease to our gross US deferred tax assets which is offset by a corresponding decrease to our valuation allowance As of December 31 2018 we had 730 billion of federal and 537 billion of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 2028 for state purposes A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity prior to our acquisition in 2016 and therefore are subject to change of control provisions which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year We do not expect these change of control limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes As of December 31 2018 we had research and development tax credits of 2561 million and 2762 million for federal and state income tax purposes respectively If not utilized the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024 However the state research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely In addition we have other general business tax credits of 1268 million for federal income tax purposes which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033 Collectively we had no foreign earnings as of December 31 2018 and therefore was not subject to the mandatory repatriation tax provisions of the Tax Act However some of our foreign subsidiaries do have accumulated earnings No deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been recorded relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to prior ownership changes 128 Uncertain Tax Positions The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows in thousands December 31 2015 99127 Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions 28677 Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 62805 Assumed uncertain tax positions through acquisition 13327 December 31 2016 203936 Decrease in balances related to prior year tax positions 31493 Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 84352 Change in balances related to effect of US tax law change 58050 December 31 2017 198745 Decrease in balances related to prior year tax positions 6347 Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 60960 December 31 2018 253357 As of December 31 2018 accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and were immaterial Unrecognized tax benefits of 2438 million if recognized would not affect our effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance We file income tax returns in the US California and various state and foreign jurisdictions We are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2015 and 2016 Additional tax years within the period 2004 to 2017 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes and tax years 2004 to 2017 remain subject to examination for California income tax purposes All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for US federal and California income tax purposes Tax years 2008 to 2017 remain subject to examination in other US state and foreign jurisdictions The potential outcome of the current examination could result in a change to unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months However we cannot reasonably estimate possible adjustments at this time The US Tax Court issued a decision in Altera Corp v Commissioner related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in a costsharing arrangement As this decision can be overturned upon appeal we have not recorded any impact as of December 31 2018 In addition any potential tax benefits would increase our US deferred tax asset which is currently offset with a full valuation allowance

manufacturing facility if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements then we would be obligated to pay a 412 million program payment to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements Furthermore if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us then additional amounts might become payable by us The noncash investing and financing activities related to the arrangement during the years ended December 31 2018 and 2017 amounted to 80 million and 861 million The noncash investing and financing activities related to the arrangement from the Acquisition Date through December 31 2016 amounted to 56 million Environmental Liabilities In connection with our factory located in Fremont California we are obligated to pay for

purported stockholder class action was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity and two of its officers The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCitys securities from March 6 2013 to March 18 2014 After a series of amendments to the original complaint the District Court dismissed the amended complaint and entered a judgment in our favor on August 9 2016 The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal and on December 4 2017 the Court heard oral argument on the appeal On March 8 2018 the Court upheld the District Court ruling of dismissal and judgment in our favor The case is concluded Securities Litigation Relating

acquisition of SolarCity Following consolidation the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Teslas board of directors as then constituted and alleges among other things that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks among other relief unspecified monetary damages attorneys fees and costs On January 27 2017 defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint Rather than respond to the defendants motion the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint On March 17 2017 defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint On December 13 2017 the Court heard oral argument on the motion On March 28 2018 the Court denied defendants motion to dismiss Defendants filed a request for interlocutory appeal but the Delaware Supreme Court denied that request electing not to hear an appeal at this early stage of the case Defendants filed their answer on May 18 2018 The parties are proceeding with discovery The case is set for trial in March 2020 These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the US District Court for the District of Delaware on April 21 2017 Those actions have been consolidated and are stayed pending the Chancery Court litigation They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Teslas board of directors That action is stayed pending the Chancery Court litigation We believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with these claims Securities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles On October 10 2017 a purported stockholder class action was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla two of its current officers and a former officer The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May 4 2016 to October 6 2017 The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Companys preparedness to produce Model 3 vehicles Plaintiffs filed

complaint on September 28 2018 We will file a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on February 15 2019 The hearing on the motion to dismiss is set for March 1 2019 We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with this lawsuit 131 On October 26 2018 in a similar action a purported stockholder class action was filed in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Tesla Elon Musk and seven initial purchasers in an offering of debt securities by Tesla in August 2017 The complaint alleges misrepresentations made by Tesla regarding the number of Model 3 vehicles Tesla expected to produce by the end of 2017 in connection with such offering and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities in such offering Tesla thereafter removed the case to federal court On January 22 2019 plaintiff abandoned its effort to proceed in state court instead filing an amended complaint against Tesla Elon Musk and seven initial purchasers in the debt offering before the same judge in the US District Court for the Northern District of California who is hearing the abovereferenced earlier filed federal court case On February 5 2019 the Court stayed this new case pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss the complaint in the above earlier filed case We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with this lawsuit Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award On June 4 2018 a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr Musk and the members of Teslas board of directors as then constituted alleging that such board members breached their fiduciary

Between August 10 2018 and September 6 2018 nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Elon Musks August 7 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private All of the suits are now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California Although the complaints vary in certain respects they each purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to Mr Musks statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Teslas securities Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint on January 16 2019 and added as defendants the members of Teslas board of directors Defendants plan to file a motion to dismiss the complaint on or before March 7 2019 The hearing on the motion to dismiss is tentatively set for June 20 2019 We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously We are unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss associated with these claims Between October 17 2018 and November 9 2018 five derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr Musk and the members of Teslas board of directors as then constituted in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction These cases have been stayed pending resolution of the stockholder class action In addition to these cases on October 25 2018 another derivative lawsuit was filed in federal court in Delaware against Mr Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted and the parties have agreed to also stay this case pending resolution of the stockholder class action the parties proposed stipulation regarding the stay is pending with the Court We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously The Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss associated with these claims Settlement with SEC related to Potential Going Private Transaction On October 16 2018 the US District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29 2018 in connection with the actions taken by the US Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC relating to Elon Musks prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private Without admitting or denying any of the SECs allegations and with no restriction on Mr Musks ability to serve as an officer or director on the Board other than as its Chair among other things we and Mr Musk paid civil penalties of 20 million each and agreed that an independent director will serve as Chair of the Board for at least three years and we appointed such an independent Chair of the Board and two additional independent directors to the Board and further enhanced our disclosure controls and other corporate governancerelated matters 132 Certain Investigations and Other Matters We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the National Transportation Safety Board the SEC the Department of Justice DOJ and various state federal and international agencies We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests In particular the SEC has issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with a Mr Musks prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private and b certain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and other public statements relating to Model 3 production The DOJ has also asked us to voluntarily provide it with information about each of these matters and is investigating Aside from the settlement with the SEC relating to Mr Musks statement that he was considering taking Tesla private there have not been any developments in these matters that we deem to be material and to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred As is our normal practice we have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with government authorities We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business results of operation prospects cash flows and financial position We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business results of operations prospects cash flows financial position and brand Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from reductions in US Treasury grants or ITCs Generally such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy systems as assessed by the US Treasury Department for purposes of claiming US Treasury grants or as assessed by the IRS for purposes of claiming ITCs or US Treasury grants For each balance sheet date we assess and recognize when applicable a distribution payable for the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information available at that time including any guidelines issued by the US Treasury Department on solar energy system valuations for purposes of claiming US Treasury grants and any audits undertaken by the IRS We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us which were immaterial for this obligation are not probable based on the facts known at the filing date The maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the solar energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the values that the US Treasury Department would determine as fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming US Treasury grants or the values the IRS would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs or US Treasury grants We claim US Treasury grants based on guidelines provided by the US Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the IRS We use fair values determined with the assistance of independent thirdparty appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs that are passedthrough to and claimed by the fund investors Since we cannot determine future revisions to US Treasury Department guidelines governing solar energy system values or how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs or US Treasury grants we are unable to reliably estimate the maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this obligation as of each balance sheet date We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation The amount of incentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size andor the amount of solar energy produced We also currently participate in one states incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service State and local incentives received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund We are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received Our lease passthrough financing funds have a onetime lease payment reset mechanism that occurs after the installation of all solar energy systems in a fund As a result of this mechanism we may be required to refund master lease prepayments previously received from investors Any refunds of master lease prepayments would reduce the lease passthrough financing obligation 133 Letters of Credit As of December 31 2018 we had 2196 million of unused letters of credit outstanding Note 18 Variable Interest Entity Arrangements We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles In particular our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810 Consolidation We have considered the provisions within the agreements which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs including determining the solar energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs redeploying solar energy systems or vehicles and managing customer receivables We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund net of agreed upon expenses estimated expenses tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements Generally our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investors interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements Pursuant to management services maintenance and warranty arrangements we have been contracted to provide services to the funds such as operations and maintenance support accounting lease servicing and performance reporting In some instances we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements A funds creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds None of the assets of the funds had been pledged as collateral for their obligations 134 The aggregate carrying

referred to as lease passthrough fund arrangements Under these arrangements our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors through arrangements contractually structured as master leases for an initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years These solar energy systems are subject to lease or PPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25 years These solar energy systems are included within solar energy systems leased and to be leased net on the consolidated balance sheet The cost of the solar energy systems under lease passthrough fund arrangements as of December 31 2018 and 2017 was 105 billion and 109 billion respectively The accumulated depreciation on these assets as of December 31 2018 and 2017 was 661 million and 309 million

obligation as of December 31 2017 was 1348 million of which 673 million was classified as a current liability Lease passthrough financing obligation is included in accrued liabilities and other for the current portion and other longterm liabilities for the longterm portion on the consolidated balance sheet Under a lease passthrough fund arrangement the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor which is one of our subsidiaries and in some cases subsequent periodic payments We allocate a portion of the aggregate investor payments to the fair value of the assigned ITCs which is estimated by discounting the projected cash flow impact of the ITCs using a market interest rate and is accounted for separately see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies We account for the remainder of the investor payments as a borrowing by recording the proceeds received as a lease passthrough financing obligation which is repaid from the future customer lease payments and any incentive rebates A portion of the amounts received by the investor is allocated to interest expense using the effective interest rate method 135 The lease passthrough financing obligation is nonrecourse once the associated solar energy systems have been placed inservice and the associated customer arrangements have been assigned to the investors However we are required to comply with certain financial covenants specified in the contractual agreements which we had met as of December 31 2018 In addition we are responsible for any warranties performance guarantees accounting and performance reporting Furthermore we continue to account for the customer arrangements and any incentive rebates in the consolidated financial statements regardless of whether the cash is received by

investors as security for its obligations under the contractual agreements Each lease passthrough fund arrangement has a onetime master lease prepayment adjustment mechanism that occurs when the capacity and the placedinservice dates of the associated solar energy systems are finalized or on an agreedupon date As part of this mechanism the master lease prepayment amount is updated and we may be obligated to refund a portion of a master lease prepayment or entitled to receive an additional master lease prepayment Any additional master lease prepayments are recorded as an additional lease passthrough financing obligation while any master lease prepayment refunds would reduce the lease passthrough financing obligation Note 20 Defined Contribution Plan We have a 401k savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code Under the 401k savings plan participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100 of their eligible
