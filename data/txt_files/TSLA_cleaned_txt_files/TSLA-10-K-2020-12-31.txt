performance in an allwheel drive configuration and are introducing vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance Among other things we maintain extensive testing and RD capabilities for battery cells packs and systems and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithiumion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower costs we are currently using our expertise to develop a new proprietary lithiumion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes Vehicle Control and Infotainment Software The performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs require sophisticated control software Control systems in our vehicles optimize performance customize vehicle behavior manage charging and control all infotainment functions We develop almost all of this software including most of the user interfaces internally and update our vehicles software regularly through overtheair updates SelfDriving Development We have expertise in developing technologies systems and software to enable selfdriving vehicles using primarily vision and radarbased sensors Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for realworld performance Currently we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD options Although at present the driver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use when conditions permit As with other vehicle systems we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through overtheair updates We intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ridehailing network which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve Energy Generation and Storage Energy Storage Products We leverage many of the componentlevel technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products By taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems we can optimize manufacturing capacity among our energy storage products Additionally our expertise in power electronics enables us to interconnect our battery systems seamlessly with global electricity grids while providing fastacting systems for power injection and absorption We have also developed the software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems using our realtime energy trading platform 5 Solar Energy Systems We have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation The efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter which also incorporates our power electronics technologies We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall Design and Engineering Automotive We have established significant inhouse capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems Our team has core competencies in computer aided design as well as durability strength and crash test simulations which reduces the product development time of new models Additionally our team has expertise in selecting and working with a range of materials for our vehicles to balance performance cost and durability in ways that are best suited for our vehicles target demographics and utility We have also used our capabilities to achieve complex engineering feats in stamping casting and thermal systems and are currently developing designs that integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability weight range and cost characteristics We are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while exploring ways to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular markets including countryspecific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces As we increase our capabilities particularly in the areas of automation diemaking and linebuilding we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction Energy Generation and Storage Our expertise in electrical mechanical civil and software engineering allows us to design and manufacture our energy generation and storage products and components We also employ our design and engineering expertise to customize solutions including our energy storage products solar energy systems andor Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs We have developed software that simplifies and expedites the design process and maximizes the energy production of each solar energy system as well as mounting hardware that facilitates solar panel installation Sales and Marketing Historically we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products and we believe we will continue to do so Such media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs Automotive Direct Sales Our vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of companyowned stores In some jurisdictions we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory manage warranty service and pricing educate consumers about electric vehicles maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback We reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a locationbylocation level from time to time to optimize our current sales channels Sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to volatility from time to time Used Vehicle Sales Our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the tradein of a customers existing Tesla or nonTesla vehicle with the sale of a new or used Tesla vehicle The Tesla and nonTesla vehicles we acquire as tradeins are subsequently remarketed either directly by us or through third parties We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns Public Charging We have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers which are our industrial grade highspeed vehicle chargers Where possible we colocate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power Supercharger stations are typically placed along welltraveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick reliable and ubiquitous charging with convenient minimal stops Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs 6 We also work with a wide variety of hospitality retail and public destinations as well as businesses with commuting employees to offer additional charging options for our customers These Destination Charging and workplace locations deploy Tesla Wall Connectors to provide charging to Tesla vehicle owners who patronize or are employed at their businesses We also work with singlefamily homeowners and multifamily residential entities to deploy home charging solutions InApp Upgrades As our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely overtheair our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the Tesla app We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a subscription basis in the future Energy Generation and Storage We market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of channels We emphasize simplicity standardization and accessibility to make it easy and costeffective for customers to adopt clean energy while reducing our customer acquisition costs In the US we offer residential solar and energy storage products directly through our website stores and galleries as well as through our network of channel partners Outside of the US we use our international sales organization and a network of channel partners to market and sell these products for the residential market We also sell Powerwall directly to utilities In the case of products sold to utilities or channel partners such partners typically sell the product and manage the installation in customer homes We sell our commercial and utilityscale energy storage systems to customers through our US and international sales organization and our channel partner network In certain jurisdictions we also sell installed solar energy systems with or without energy storage to commercial customers through cash lease and PPA transactions Service and Warranty Automotive Service We provide service for our electric vehicles at our companyowned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work remotely at customers homes or other locations Performing vehicle service ourselves provides us with the capability to identify problems and implement solutions and improvements faster and optimize logistics and inventory better than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and remedy many problems remotely and proactively Vehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans We provide a manufacturers limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell which may include separate limited warranties on certain components specific types of damage or battery capacity retention We also currently offer extended service plans that provide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions Energy Generation and Storage We provide service and repairs to our energy product customers including under warranty where applicable Energy Storage Systems We generally provide manufacturers limited warranties with every new energy storage product and offer certain extended limited warranties that are available at the time of purchase of the system If we install a system we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation workmanship As part of our energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract Solar Energy Systems For retrofit solar energy systems we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks and for Solar Roof we provide limited

provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation requirements specified in the contract 7 Financial Services Automotive Purchase Financing and Leases We offer leasing andor loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America Europe and Asia through various financial institutions Under certain of such programs we have provided resale value guarantees or buyback guarantees that may obligate us to repurchase the subject vehicles at predetermined values We also offer vehicle financing arrangements in certain markets for specified vehicle models directly through our local subsidiaries Insurance In August 2019 we launched an insurance product designed for our customers which offers rates that are often better than other alternatives This product is currently available in California and we plan to expand both the markets in which we offer insurance products and our ability to offer such products as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers Energy Generation and Storage Energy Storage Systems We currently offer certain loan lease andor PPA options to residential or commercial customers who pair energy storage systems with solar energy systems We intend to introduce financial services offerings for customers who purchase standalone energy storage products in the future Solar Energy Systems We offer various financing options to our solar customers Our solar loan offers thirdparty financing to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system We are not a party to the loan agreement and the thirdparty lender has no recourse against us with respect to the loan Our solar lease offers customers a fixed monthly fee at rates that typically translate into lower monthly utility bills and an electricity production guarantee Our solar PPA charges customers a fee per kilowatthour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems We monetize the customer payments we receive from our leases and PPAs through funds we have formed with investors We also intend to introduce financial services offerings for our Solar Roof customers in the future Manufacturing Manufacturing Facilities in the Bay Area California We manufacture and test our vehicles at our manufacturing facilities in the Bay Area in California including the Fremont Factory and other local manufacturing facilities We also manufacture and develop certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards such as Model S and Model X battery packs and our proprietary lithiumion battery cells at these locations Gigafactory Nevada near Reno Nevada We have integrated battery material cell module and battery pack production for Model 3 Model Y and our energy products in one location at Gigafactory Nevada In addition we manufacture vehicle drive units and our energy storage products there Gigafactory Nevada allows us to access high volumes of lithiumion battery cells manufactured by our partner Panasonic there while achieving a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs We continue to invest in Gigafactory Nevada to achieve additional output there including through our agreement with Panasonic Gigafactory New York in Buffalo New York We use Gigafactory New York for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components energy storage components and Supercharger components and for other lessorapproved functions Gigafactory Shanghai in China We established Gigafactory Shanghai to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs We continue to increase the degree of localized procurement and manufacturing there Gigafactory Shanghai is representative of our plan to iteratively improve our manufacturing operations as we establish new factories as we implemented the learnings from our Model 3 ramp at the Fremont Factory to commence and ramp our production there quickly and costeffectively 8 Other Manufacturing Generally we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities We also intend to further increase costcompetitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing including at Gigafactory Berlin in Germany and Gigafactory Texas in Austin Texas which are under construction Supply Chain Our products use thousands of purchased parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world We have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells electronics and complex vehicle assemblies Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale As is the case for most automotive companies most of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers Where multiple sources are available for certain key components we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize production risks owing to disruptions in their supply We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times Our products use various raw materials including aluminum steel cobalt lithium nickel and copper Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control such as supply and demand and market speculation We strive to execute longterm supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies in order to meet the needs of our operations Governmental Programs Incentives and Regulations Globally both the operation of our business by us and the ownership of our products by our customers are impacted by various government programs incentives and other arrangements Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions Programs and Incentives California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives We have agreements with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority that provide multiyear sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes including the expansion and ongoing development of electric vehicles and powertrain production in California Gigafactory NevadaNevada Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada These incentives are available until June 2024 or June 2034 depending on the incentive Gigafactory New YorkNew York State Investment and Lease We have a lease through the Research Foundation for the State University of New York the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York Under the lease and a related research and development agreement we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility We are required to comply with certain covenants including hiring and cumulative investment targets As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID19 pandemic we were granted a oneyear deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets under such agreement on April 30 2020 which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in July 2020 Gigafactory ShanghaiLand Use Rights and Economic Benefits We have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai Under the terms of the arrangement we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023 In addition the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary in 2019 and 2020 certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai Finally the Shanghai government granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15 to certain eligible enterprises which is lower than the 25 statutory corporate income tax rate in China Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this lower rate for 2019 through 2023 9 Gigafactory Berlin Pending Grant We have applied for a grant with the German government to improve the design chemistry manufacturing technology and recycling of lithiumion battery cells for Gigafactory Berlin The grant was approved by the European Commission in January 2021 and its implementation will be subject to a grant agreement with the German government Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas we entered into a 20year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 7080 of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zeroemission vehicles ZEVs greenhouse gas fuel economy renewable energy and clean fuel We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards renewable energy procurement standards and other regulatory requirements Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies While the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development there are various policies incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage For example energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energyrelated US federal tax credits described below The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets In addition California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage and behindthemeter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program Solar Energy System Incentives and Policies US federal state and local governments have established various policies incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy These incentives include tax credits cash grants tax abatements and rebates In particular Sections 48 and 25D of the US Internal Revenue Code currently provide a tax credit of 26 of qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems These tax credits are currently scheduled to decline andor expire in 2023 and beyond Regulations Vehicle Safety and Testing In the US our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness requirements crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements While our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions FMVSS are subject to change from time to time As a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the US We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA including the CAFE standards Theft Prevention Act requirements consumer information labeling requirements Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls owners manual requirements and additional requirements for cooperating with safety investigations and defect and recall reporting The US Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturers suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing In addition federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings as determined by the US Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency the EPA and 5star safety ratings as determined by NHTSA if available 10 Our vehicles sold outside of the US are subject to similar foreign safety environmental and other regulations Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the US and may require redesign andor retesting Some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features Additionally t he European Union has established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commence d in 2020 and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union SelfDriving Vehicles Generally laws pertaining to selfdriving vehicles are evolving globally and in some cases may create restrictions on selfdriving features that we develop While there are currently no federal US regulations specifically pertaining to selfdriving vehicles or selfdriving equipment NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on selfdriving vehicles and retains the authority to investigate andor take action on the safety of any vehicle equipment or features operating on public roads Certain US states have legal restrictions on the operation registration or licensure of selfdriving vehicles and many other states are considering them This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to selfdriving vehicles in the US In markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe some requirements restrict the design of advanced driverassistance or selfdriving features which can compromise or prevent their use entirely Other applicable laws both current and proposed may hinder the path and timeline to introducing selfdriving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply Other key markets including China continue to consider selfdriving regulation Any implemented regulations may differ materially from those in the US and Europe which may further increase the legal complexity of selfdriving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation In the US state laws regulate the manufacture distribution sale and service of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturers ability to deliver or service vehicles To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we generally conduct the transfer of title out of the state In certain such states we have opened galleries that serve an educational purpose and where the title transfer may not occur Some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations Certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations We expect such challenges to continue and we intend to actively fight any such efforts Battery Safety and Testing Our battery packs are subject to various US and international regulations that govern transport of dangerous goods defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations We use lithiumion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products The use storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs and we are also piloting our own recycling technology Solar EnergyGeneral We are not a regulated utility in the US although we are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers To operate our systems we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities Sales of electricity and nonsale equipment leases by third parties such as our leases PPAs and subscription agreements have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions Solar EnergyNet Metering Most states in the US make net energy metering or net metering available to solar customers Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid In certain jurisdictions regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so 11 Competition Automotive The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader crosssection of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicles capabilities We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology For example Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to mediumsized sedans and compact SUVs which are extremely competitive markets Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers however many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles Overall we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the US China and Europe and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles In addition several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles including plugin versions We also believe that there is increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering selfdriving technologies charging solutions and other features and services and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot FSD and neural network capabilities Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings Energy Generation and Storage Energy Storage Systems The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems We compete with these companies based on price energy density and efficiency We believe that the specifications and features of our products our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets Solar Energy Systems The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems while others only provide financing for these installations We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems Intellectual Property We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio As part of our business we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other measures including through employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements For example we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world Human Capital Resources As of December 31 2020 our fulltime count for our and our subsidiaries employees worldwide was 70757 To date we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values 12 We want to attract a pool of diverse and exceptional candidates and support their career growth once they become employees Our efforts begin at the entry level with development apprenticeship and internship programs in local high schools community colleges and fouryear colleges In addition we seek to hire based on talent rather than solely on educational pedigree and have provided thousands of job openings including in our local communities for capable workers from various backgrounds to learn valuable skills in critical operations such as in manufacturing vehicle service and energy product installation We also emphasize in our evaluation and career development efforts internal mobility opportunities for employees to drive professional development Our goal is a longterm upwardbound career at Tesla for every employee which we believe also drives our retention efforts We also believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe respectful fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business From our outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions to sponsoring employee resource groups across numerous locations including Asian Pacific Islanders at Tesla Black at Tesla Intersectionality Latinos at Tesla LGBTQ at Tesla Veterans at Tesla and Women in Tesla we engage these networks as key business resources and sources of actionable feedback We are also working on diversity efforts in our supply chain to expand our outreach and support to small and largescale suppliers from underrepresented communities to emphasize this culture with our own employees Available Information We file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto including our Annual Reports on Form 10K

the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business We may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global COVID19 pandemic Since the first quarter of 2020 there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID19 pandemic Government regulations and shifting social behaviors have limited or closed nonessential transportation government functions business activities and persontoperson interactions In some cases the relaxation of such trends has recently been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce including in parts of the US and a number of areas in Europe We temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of 2020 Some of our suppliers and partners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming including Panasonic which manufactures battery cells for our products at our Gigafactory Nevada We also instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our US operations were scaled back Reduced operations or closures at motor vehicle departments vehicle auction houses and municipal and utility company inspectors have resulted in challenges in or postponements for our new vehicle deliveries used vehicle sales and energy product deployments Global trade conditions and consumer trends may further adversely impact us and our industries For example pandemicrelated issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts Similarly increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of microchip supply and it is yet unknown how we may be impacted Sustaining our production trajectory will require the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors a stable and motivated production workforce and ongoing government cooperation including for travel and visa allowances The contingencies inherent in the construction of and ramp at new facilities such as Gigafactory Shanghai Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges We cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends the sustained impact of which is largely unknown is rapidly evolving and has varied across geographic regions Ultimately we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production workforce and other resources accordingly If current global market conditions continue or worsen or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again our business prospects financial condition and operating results may be harmed We may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs We have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features For example we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the ramp of Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes In addition we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features In particular our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of massmarket vehicles including Model 3 and Model Y which we are planning to achieve through multiple factories worldwide We have relatively limited experience to date in manufacturing Model 3 and Model Y at high volumes and even less experience building and ramping vehicle production lines across multiple factories in different geographies In order to be successful we will need to implement maintain and ramp efficient and costeffective manufacturing capabilities processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California Nevada Texas China and Germany We will also need to hire train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs If we are not successful in achieving these goals we could face delays in establishing andor sustaining our Model 3 and Model Y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets We may also experience similar future delays in launching andor ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof new product versions or variants new vehicles such as Tesla Semi Cybertruck and the new Tesla Roadster and future features and services such as new Autopilot or FSD features and the autonomous Tesla ridehailing network Likewise we may encounter delays with the design construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products 14 Any delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future products features and services or in doing so costeffectively and with high quality may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results We may be unable to grow our global product sales delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging networks or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth Our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities We also frequently adjust our retail operations and product offerings in order to optimize our reach costs product lineup and model differentiation and customer experience However there is no guarantee that such steps will be accepted by consumers accustomed to traditional sales strategies For example marketing methods such as touchless test drives that we have pioneered in certain markets have not been proven at scale We are targeting with Model 3 and Model Y a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products We currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region Likewise as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets Because we do not have independent dealer networks we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers While we have improved our delivery logistics we may face difficulties with deliveries at increasing volumes particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times For example we saw challenges in ramping our logistics channels in China and Europe to initially deliver Model 3 there in the first quarter of 2019 We have deployed a number of delivery models such as deliveries to customers homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally Likewise as we ramp Solar Roof we are working to substantially increase installation personnel and decrease installation times If we are not successful in matching such capabilities with actual production or if we experience unforeseen production delays or inaccurately forecast demand for the Solar Roof our business financial condition and operating results may be harmed Moreover because of our unique expertise with our vehicles we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized professionals If we experience delays in adding such servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles particularly highervolume and newer additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory Similarly the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world There is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales delivery installation servicing and vehicle charging targets globally that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them As we expand w e will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale installation and servicing of our products the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers If we fail to manage our growth effectively it may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results Our future growth and success are dependent upon consumers demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an automotive industry that is generally competitive cyclical and volatile If the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other our business prospects financial condition and operating results may be harmed We are still at an earlier stage and have limited resources and production relative to established competitors that offer internal combustion engine vehicles In addition electric vehicles still comprise a small percentage of overall vehicle sales As a result the market for our vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors such as perceptions about electric vehicle features quality safety performance and cost perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge and access to charging facilities competition including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles plugin hybrid electric vehicles and high fueleconomy internal combustion engine vehicles volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline such as wide fluctuations in crude oil prices during 2020 15 government regulations and economic incentives and concerns about our future viability Finally the target demographics for our vehicles particularly Model 3 and Model Y are highly competitive Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to further volatility as we expand and adjust our operations and retail strategies Moreover the COVID19 pandemic may negatively impact the transportation and automotive industries longterm It is uncertain as to how such macroeconomic factors will impact us as a company that has been experiencing growth and increasing market share in an industry that has globally been experiencing a recent decline in sales Our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules prices quality and volumes that are acceptable to us or we may be unable to manage these components effectively Our products contain thousands of parts that we purchase globally from hundreds of mostly singlesource direct suppliers generally without longterm supply agreements This exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages such as those that we experienced in 2012 and 2016 with our Model S and Model X ramps Unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing labor issues wars governmental changes tariffs natural disasters such as the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan health epidemics such as the global COVID19 pandemic trade and shipping disruptions and other factors beyond our or our suppliers control could also affect these suppliers ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational For example a global shortage of microchips has been reported since early 2021 and the impact to us is yet unknown The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays idle manufacturing facilities product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products Moreover significant increases in our production such as for Model 3 and Model Y or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time Our suppliers may not be willing or able to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost quality and volume needs or to do so may cost us more which may require us to replace them with other sources Finally we have limited vehicle manufacturing experience outside of the Fremont Factory and we may experience issues increasing the level of localized procurement at our Gigafactory Shanghai and at future factories such as Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all Additionally we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce Any of these occurrences may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results As the scale of our vehicle production increases we will also need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and writeoff costs which may harm our business and operating results We may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines costs and production ramps at new factories or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there Our ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of Gigafactory Shanghai Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas The construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements procurement and maintenance of construction environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion potential supply chain constraints hiring training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture highquality units at scale For example we are currently constructing Gigafactory Berlin under conditional permits Moreover we intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory We have limited experience to date with developing and implementing vehicle manufacturing innovations outside of the Fremont Factory as we only recently began production at Gigafactory Shanghai In particular the majority of our design and engineering resources are currently located in California In order to meet our expectations for our new factories we must expand and manage localized design and engineering talent and resources If we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines costs capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories expanding and managing teams to implement iterative design and production changes there maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there our business prospects operating results and financial condition may be harmed 16 We will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells including through the development and manufacture of our own cells and control our related costs We are dependent on the continued supply of lithiumion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products and we will require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans Currently we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic for these cells However we have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products In the long term we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us which we believe will be more efficient manufacturable at greater volumes and costeffective than currently available cells However our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required and may require significant investments and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all If we are unable to do so we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs either of which may harm our business and operating results In addition the cost of battery cells whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium nickel cobalt andor other metals The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices Moreover any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand prospects and operating results We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future For example Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan and compact SUV markets A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers as well as other companies have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles including hybrid plugin hybrid and fully electric vehicles as well as the market for selfdriving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms In some cases our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe andor have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future Many of our competitors have significantly greater or betterestablished resources than we do to devote to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales price reductions revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which may harm our business financial condition and operating results We also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers developers installers and service providers of competing energy systems as well as from large utilities Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of residential customer defaults under our existing longterm leases and PPAs Risks Related to Our Operations We may experience issues with lithiumion cells or other components manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products Our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithiumion battery cell production by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada Although Panasonic has a long track record of producing highquality cells at significant volume at its factories in Japan it has relatively limited experience with cell production at Gigafactory Nevada which began in 2017 Moreover although Panasonic is colocated with us at Gigafactory Nevada it is free to make its own operational decisions such as its determination to temporarily suspend its manufacturing there in response to the COVID19 pandemic In addition we produce several vehicle components such as battery modules and packs incorporating the cells produced by Panasonic for Model 3 and Model Y and drive units including to support Gigafactory Shanghai production at Gigafactory Nevada and we also manufacture energy storage products there In the past some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines If we or Panasonic are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations at Gigafactory Nevada production or if we are unable to do so costeffectively or hire and retain highlyskilled personnel there our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited which may harm our business and operating results Finally the high volumes of lithiumion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada are stored and recycled at our various facilities Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities While 17 we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory political economic tax and labor conditions We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements political uncertainty and social environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable Our operations in such jurisdictions particularly as a company based in the US create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures organizing local operating entities establishing staffing and managing foreign business locations attracting local customers navigating foreign government taxes regulations and permit requirements enforceability of our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange controls and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products Such conditions may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention and may harm our business if we unable to manage them effectively Our business may suffer if our products or features contain defects fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional If our products contain design or manufacturing defects that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD features take longer than expected to become enabled are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation our ability to develop market and sell our products and services may be harmed and we may experience delivery delays product recalls product liability breach of warranty and consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses In particular our products are highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects or errors or be subject to external attacks Issues experienced by our customers have included those related to the Model S and Model X 17inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12volt battery in the Model S the seats and doors in the Model X and the operation of solar panels installed by us Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible such efforts may not be timely may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers While we have performed extensive internal testing on our products and features we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate their longterm quality reliability durability and performance characteristics There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers We may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims The automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected As is true for other automakers our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury and such accidents where Autopilot or FSD features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention We have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of such new technologies that we are pioneering In addition the battery packs that we produce make use of lithiumion cells On rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cells release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur in particular due to a highspeed crash Likewise as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages product recalls or redesign efforts and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and timeconsuming In most jurisdictions we generally selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance We will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our longterm business prospects in order to succeed In order to maintain and grow our business we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers suppliers analysts investors ratings agencies and other parties in our longterm financial viability and business prospects Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors customer unfamiliarity with our products any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing delivery and service operations to meet demand competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations and other factors including those over which we have no control In particular Teslas products business results of operations statements and actions are wellpublicized by a range of third parties Such attention includes frequent criticism which is often exaggerated or unfounded such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team Any such negative perceptions whether caused by us or not may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed 18 We may be unable to effectively grow or manage the compliance residual value financing and credit risks related to our various financing programs We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America Europe and Asia primarily through various financial institutions We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets Depending on the country such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state andor local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing these transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties The profitability of any directlyleased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles residual values at the outset of the leases and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program The funding and growth of this program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing andor business partners If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds partners or other financing sources and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries Furthermore if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk Similarly we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at predetermined amounts However actual resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the predetermined amounts we have offered our financial condition and operating results may be harmed Finally our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all If a significant number of our customers default we may incur substantial credit losses andor impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets We must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York relating to our Gigafactory New York We are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the SUNY Foundation These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York which we have primarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components energy storage components and Supercharger components and for other lessorapproved functions Under this agreement we are obligated to among other things meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo New York and spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10year period beginning April 30 2018 As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID19 pandemic we were granted a oneyear deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets under such agreement on April 30 2020 which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in July 2020 While we expect to have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a program payment of 41 million to the SUNY Foundation for such year the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York which may require us to pay additional penalties andor the need to adjust certain of our operations in particular our production ramp of the Solar Roof or other components Any of the foregoing events may harm our business financial condition and operating results If we are unable to attract hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel our ability to compete may be harmed The loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the development introduction and ramp of our products and services In particular we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract hire and retain a large number of engineering manufacturing marketing sales and delivery service installation technology and support personnel especially to support our planned highvolume product sales market and geographical 19 expansion and technological innovation s Recruiting efforts particularly for senior employees may be timeconsuming which may delay the execution of our plans If we are not successful in managing these risks our business financial condition and operating results may be harmed Employees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience or any negative publicity related to us In California Nevada and other regions where we have operations there is increasing competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles software engineering manufacturing engineering and electrical and building construction expertise Moreover we may be impacted by perceptions relating to reductions in force that we have conducted in the past in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and the departure of certain senior personnel for various reasons Likewise as a result of our temporary suspension of various US manufacturing operations in the first half of 2020 in April 2020 we temporarily furloughed certain hourly employees and reduced most salaried employees base salaries We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and startups and emerging companies that promise shortterm growth opportunities Finally our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins with an emphasis on equitybased awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the longterm interests of our stockholders We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans If we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer and largest stockholder Although Mr Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla Mr Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and is involved in other emerging technology ventures We must manage risks relating to our information technology systems and the threat of intellectual property theft data breaches and cyberattacks We must continue to expand and improve our information technology systems as our operations grow such as product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance systems This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the US and abroad We must also continue to maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft data breaches sabotage and other external or internal cyberattacks or misappropriation However the implementation maintenance segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost and there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems including disruptions to the related areas of business operation These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service products adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations Moreover if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these systems as planned our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results Moreover our proprietary information or intellectual property could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products Our products contain complex information technology systems For example our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks our products and their systems malicious entities have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such networks products and systems to gain control of or to change our products functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability However there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful 20 Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations In addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our products their systems or data as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products their systems or data are capable of being hacked may harm our brand prospects and operating results We have been the subject of such reports in the past Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities It is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as us to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages Moreover regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the US mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies operations Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory From time to time labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board and they may do so in the future In September 2019 an administrative law judge issued a recommended decision for Tesla on certain issues and against us on certain others The National Labor Relations Board has not yet adopted the recommendation and we have appealed certain aspects of the recommended decision Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Teslas treatment of our employees Furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results We may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions As a manufacturing company we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from for example industrywide issues with airbags from a particular supplier concerns of corrosion in Model S and Model X power steering assist motor bolts certain suspension failures in Model S and Model X and issues with Model S and Model X media control units In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that shows the actual safety risk to be nonexistent In the future we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as US federal motor vehicle safety standards Such recalls whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers could result in significant expense supply chain complications and service burdens and may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims We provide a manufacturers warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell We also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell including on their installation and maintenance and for components not manufactured by us we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers warranties As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract Under these performance guarantees we bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls even if they result from failures in components from third party manufacturers These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our financial condition and operating results may be harmed Warranty reserves include our managements best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such as Model 3 Model Y and Solar Roof that we have recently introduced andor that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future Our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks We may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of God and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage As a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all Additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or selfinsured retentions policy limitations and exclusions and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which may harm our financial condition and operating results 21 There is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness or that we will not incur additional indebtedness As of December 31 2020 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 1057 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see Note 12 Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions We and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt Holders of convertible senior notes issued by us or our subsidiary may convert such notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the respective convertible senior notes under certain circumstances pursuant to the terms of such notes Upon conversion of the applicable convertible senior notes we will be obligated to deliver cash andor shares pursuant to the terms of such notes For example as our stock price has significantly increased recently we have seen higher levels of early conversions of such inthemoney convertible senior notes Moreover holders of such convertible senior notes may have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change pursuant to the terms of such notes Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures If we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time In addition our ability to make payments may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business The terms of certain of our credit facilities including our senior assetbased revolving credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or make other restricted payments and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt In addition under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio As a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions including to obtain additional financing as needed may be restricted Furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt If any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it Additional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them Our business and our future plans for expansion are capitalintensive and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund together with our principal sources of liquidity the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected We may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment We depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives However product cycles or manufacturing technology may change periodically and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected Moreover improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment Alternatively as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our results of operations may be harmed 22 We hold and may acquire digital assets that may be subject to volatile market prices impairmen t and unique risks of loss In January 2021 we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity As part of the policy which was duly approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors we may invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets gold bullion gold exchangetraded funds and other assets as specified in the future Thereafter we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or longterm Moreover we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt The prices of digital assets have been in the past and may continue to be highly volatile including as a result of various associated risks and uncertainties For example the prevalence of such assets is a relatively recent trend and their longterm adoption by investors consumers and businesses is unpredictable Moreover their lack of a physical form their reliance on technology for their creation existence and transactional validation and their decentralization may subject their integrity to the threat of malicious attacks and technological obsolescence Finally the extent to which securities laws or other regulations apply or may apply in the future to such assets is unclear and may change in the future If we hold digital assets and their values decrease relative to our purchase prices our financial condition may be harmed Moreover digital assets are currently considered indefinitelived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules meaning that any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale which may adversely affect our operating results in any period in which such impairment occurs Moreover there is no guarantee that future changes in GAAP will not require us to change the way we account for digital assets held by us Finally as intangible assets without centralized issuers or governing bodies digital assets have been and may in the future be subject to security breaches cyberattacks or other malicious activities as well as human errors or computer malfunctions that may result in the loss or destruction of private keys needed to access such assets While we intend to take all reasonable measures to secure any digital assets if such threats are realized or the measures or controls we create or implement to secure our digital assets fail it could result in a partial or total misappropriation or loss of our digital assets and our financial condition and operating results may be harmed We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates We transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the US dollar currently primarily the Chinese yuan euro Canadian dollar and British pound To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies any strengthening of the US dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in US dollars as we have historically experienced In addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the US dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured in US dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer Moreover while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact As a result our operating results may be harmed We may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and expensive Our competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our products and services which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business From time to time the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses andor may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights which could result in substantial costs negative publicity and management attention regardless of merit While we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by our competitors Accordingly we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses In addition if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third partys intellectual property rights we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to redesign our products and services andor to establish and maintain alternative 23 branding for our products and services In the event that we are required to take one or more such actions our brand business financial condition and operating results may be harmed Our operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control such as natural disasters wars or health epidemics We may be impacted by natural disasters wars health epidemics or other events outside of our control For example our corporate headquarters the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a floodprone area If major disasters such as earthquakes floods or other events occur or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products In addition the global COVID19 pandemic has impacted economic markets manufacturing operations supply chains employment and consumer behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world and we have been and may in the future be adversely affected as a result We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition Risks Related to Government Laws and Regulations Demand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of such products Government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the US and abroad including certain tax exemptions tax credits and rebates may be reduced eliminated or exhausted from time to time For example a 7500 federal tax credit that was available in the US for the purchase of our vehicles was reduced in phases during and ultimately ended in 2019 We believe that this sequential phaseout likely pulled forward some vehicle demand into the periods preceding each reduction Moreover previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in areas including Ontario Canada Germany Hong Kong Denmark and California have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted which may have negatively impacted sales Any similar developments could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles and we and our customers may have to adjust to them In addition certain governmental rebates tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds However these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase sometimes without warning For example the US federal government currently offers certain tax credits for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a cosited solar power facility however these tax credits are currently scheduled to decline andor expire in 2023 and beyond Likewise in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use The benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the FERC Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for potential customers increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets Finally we and our fund investors claim these US federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems Nevertheless the relevant governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that these values should be lower and they may do so again in the future Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences andor our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors We are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes upon our operations or products As we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions we are or will be subject to complex environmental manufacturing health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the US China Germany and other locations abroad including laws relating to the use handling storage recycling disposal andor human exposure to hazardous materials product material inputs and postconsumer products and with respect to constructing expanding and maintaining our facilities The costs of compliance including remediations of any discovered issues and any changes to our operations mandated by new or amended laws may be significant and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses delays or fines We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply manufacture import sale and service of automobiles both domestically and abroad For example in countries outside of the US we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and 24 emissions that are often materially different from requirements in the US thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements In particular we offer in our vehicles Autopilot and FSD features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation We are continuing to develop our FSD technology with the goal of achieving full selfdriving capability in the future There are a variety of international federal and state regulations that may apply to selfdriving vehicles which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a driver Such regulations continue to rapidly change which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations or may delay products or restrict selfdriving features and availability which could adversely affect our business Finally as a manufacturer installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems and a supplier of electricity generated and stored by the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers we are impacted by federal state and local regulations and policies concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by third partyowned systems If regulations and policies that adversely impact the interconnection or use of our solar and energy storage systems are introduced they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and operations in the relevant jurisdictions which may harm our business financial condition and operating results Any failure by us to comply with a variety of US and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us Any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws and in particular certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation and application For example in May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation began to fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union and has created new compliance obligations and significantly increased fines for noncompliance Similarly as of January 2020 the California Consumer Privacy Act imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents Finally new privacy and cybersecurity laws are coming into effect in China Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if for example third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers personal information A major breach of our network security and systems may result in fines penalties and damages and harm our brand prospects and operating results We could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K To our knowledge no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred However we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC the US Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future Moreover we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas and if instituted in defending against any governmental proceedings For example on October 16 2018 the US District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29 2018 in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Mr Musks statement on August 7 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private Pursuant to the settlement we among other things paid a civil penalty of 20 million appointed an independent director as the chair of our board of directors appointed two additional independent directors to our board of directors and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governancerelated matters On April 26 2019 this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previouslyagreed disclosure procedures which was subsequently approved by the Court All other terms of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement if there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us 25 We may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies including sales through our website we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the US with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this directtoconsumer sales model It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and such assertions persist In certain locations decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been and may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers In some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict Internationally there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intraday trading high of 90040 per share and a low of 7010 per share as adjusted to give effect to the reflect the fiveforone stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020 the Stock Split The stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies In particular a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in its market price Public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance In addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares securities class action litigation has been filed against us While we defend such actions vigorously any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors We expect our periodtoperiod financial results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities may not be consistent or linear between periods Additionally our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products As a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance Moreover our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts ratings agencies or investors who may be focused only on shortterm quarterly financial results If any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which could cause our stock price to decline We may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes which generally are not linear throughout a given period average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions If our guidance varies from actual results due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties the market value of our common stock could decline significantly 26 Transactions relating to our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock The conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes issued by us or our subsidiaries would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes by their holders and we may be required to deliver a significant number of shares Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect their prevailing market prices In addition the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions or the anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock Moreover in connection with certain of the convertible senior notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution andor offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable notes We also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates In addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions which could also affect the market price of our common stock or the convertible senior notes If Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations such sales could cause our stock price to decline Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to thirdparty participants in such offerings and placements We are not a party to these loans which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr Musk If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially Mr Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further Antitakeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could impair a takeover attempt Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations In addition the terms of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change including a takeover of our company Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES We are headquartered in Palo Alto California Our principal facilities include a large number of properties in North America Europe and Asia utilized for manufacturing and assembly warehousing engineering retail and service locations Supercharger sites and administrative and sales offices Our facilities are

material pending legal proceedings please see Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K In addition each of the matters below is being disclosed pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation SK because it relates to environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties that could potentially exceed 1 million We believe that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalties far in excess of such amount The Bay Area Air Quality Management District BAAQMD has issued notices of violation to us relating to air permitting and related compliance for the Fremont Factory but has not initiated formal proceedings We have disputed certain of these allegations and have asserted that there has been no related adverse community or environmental impact While we have not yet resolved this matter we remain in close communication with BAAQMD with respect to it We do not currently expect any material adverse impact on our business The German Umweltbundesamt has issued our subsidiary in Germany a notice and fine in the amount of 12 million euro alleging its noncompliance under applicable laws relating to market participation notifications and takeback obligations with respect to endoflife battery products required thereunder This is primarily relating to administrative requirements but Tesla has continued to take back battery packs and although we cannot predict the outcome of this matter including the final amount of any penalties we have filed our objection and it is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business We have also received a followup information request from the EPA under Section 114a of the Clean Air Act of 1963 as amended the Clean Air Act The EPA is reviewing the compliance of our Fremont Factory operations with applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act and we are working with the EPA in responding its requests for information While the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business I TEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable 28 PART II ITEM 5 MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2018related items refer to Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10K for fiscal year 2019 which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 13 2020 Overview and 2020 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy We design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems and energy storage products We also offer maintenance installation operation financial and other services related to our products In 2020 we produced 509737 vehicles and delivered 499647 vehicles We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production and capacity developing and ramping our battery cell technology increasing the affordability of our vehicles expanding our global infrastructure and introducing our next vehicles In 2020 we deployed 302 GWh of energy storage products and 205 megawatts of solar energy systems We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy systems In 2020 we recognized total revenues of 3154 billion representing an increase of 696 billion compared to the prior year We continue to ramp production build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth In 2020 our net income attributable to common stockholders was 721 million representing a favorable change of 158 billion compared to the prior year In 2020 our operating margin was 63 representing a favorable change of 66 compared to the prior year We continue to focus on operational efficiencies while we have seen an acceleration of noncash stockbased compensation expense due to a rapid increase in our market capitalization and updates to our business outlook We ended 2020 with 1938 billion in cash and cash equivalents representing an increase of 1312 billion from the end of 2019 Our cash flows from operating activities during 2020 was 594 billion compared to 241 billion during 2019 and capital expenditures amounted to 316 billion during 2020 compared to 133 billion during 2019 Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself but we will continue a number of capitalintensive projects in upcoming periods Management Opportunities Challenges and Risks and 2021 Outlook Impact of COVID19 Pandemic There continues to be worldwide impact from the COVID19 pandemic While we have been relatively successful in navigating such impact to date we have previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments There are also ongoing related risks to our business depending on the progression of the pandemic and recent trends in certain regions have indicated potential returns to limited or closed government functions business activities and persontoperson interactions Global trade conditions and consumer trends may further adversely impact us and our industries For example pandemicrelated issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts Similarly increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of microchip supply and it is yet unknown how we may be impacted Please see the Results of Operations section of this Item below and certain risk factors described in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10K particularly the first risk factor included there for more detailed descriptions of the impact and risks to our business We cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends from this pandemic the sustained impact of which is largely unknown is rapidly evolving and has varied across geographic regions Ultimately we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production workforce and other resources accordingly 31 AutomotiveProduction The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10K Production Location Vehicle Models Production Status Fremont Factory Model S and Model X Active Model 3 and Model Y Active Gigafactory Shanghai Model 3 and Model Y Active Gigafactory Berlin Model Y Constructing manufacturing facilities Gigafactory Texas Model Y Constructing manufacturing facilities Cybertruck In development TBD Tesla Semi In development Tesla Roadster In development We recently announced updated versions of Model S and Model X featuring a redesigned powertrain and other improvements In 2021 we are focused on ramping these models on new manufacturing equipment as well as production rates of Model 3 and Model Y to at least the capacity that we have installed The next phase of production growth will depend on the construction of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas each of which is progressing as planned for deliveries beginning in 2021 Our goal is to continuously decrease production costs and increase the affordability of our vehicles We are continuing to develop and manufacture our own battery cells with which we are targeting highvolume output lower capital and production costs and longer range As cell supply is critical to our business coupling this strategy with cells from our suppliers will help us stay ahead of any potential constraints However these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations which may be exacerbated by the number of concurrent international projects and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID19 pandemic and any industrywide component constraints Moreover we must meet ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory AutomotiveDemand and Sales Our cost reduction efforts and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles affordability and for example have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China In addition to opening new factories in 2021 we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles functionality including Autopilot FSD and software features and introducing anticipated future vehicles Moreover we expect to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness However we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to trade environmental and political uncertainty all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the COVID19 pandemic On the other hand there have been recent signs of recovery from competitors that experienced downturns in 2020 meaning that we will have to continue to execute well to maintain the momentum that we have gained relative to an evergrowing competitive landscape AutomotiveDeliveries and Customer Infrastructure As our deliveries increase we must work constantly to prevent our vehicle delivery capability from becoming a bottleneck on our total deliveries Situating our factories closer to local markets should mitigate the strain on our deliveries In any case as we expand we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery servicing and charging infrastructure maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure costeffectiveness and customer satisfaction In particular we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations Energy Generation and Storage Demand Production and Deployment The longterm success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand For Powerwall better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher interest and crossselling with our residential solar energy products will continue to benefit both product lines We remain committed to increasing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a lowcost and simplified online ordering experience In addition we are working to improve our installation capabilities for Solar Roof by onboarding and training a large number of installers and reducing the installation time dramatically As these product lines grow we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel particularly skilled electricians to support the ramp of Solar Roof 32 Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time and uncertainties in future global market conditions resulting from the COVID19 pandemic currently makes projections more challenging We are simultaneously ramping new products in the new Model S and Model X Model Y and Solar Roof constructing or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects the pace at which we meet milestones production adjustments to and among our various products increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth we currently expect our capital expenditures to be 450 to 600 billion in 2021 and each of the next two fiscal years Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation On the other hand we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capitalintensive projects Moreover as our stock price has significantly increased recently we have seen higher levels of early conversions of inthemoney convertible senior notes which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes Overall we expect our ability to be selffunding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales We also opportunistically strengthened our liquidity further through an atthemarket offering of common stock in December 2020 with net proceeds to us of approximately 499 billion Operating Expense Trends As long as we see expanding sales and excluding the potential impact of noncash stock compensation expense attributable to the 2018 CEO Performance Award and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we additionally increase operational efficiency and process automation In March 2018 our stockholders approved a performancebased stock option award to our CEO the 2018 CEO Performance Award consisting of 12 vesting tranches contingent on the achievement of specified market capitalization and operational milestones We incur noncash stockbased compensation expense for each tranche only after the related operational milestone initially becomes probable of being met based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance and if this happens following the grant date we record at such time a cumulative catchup expense that may be significant based on the length of time elapsed from the grant date Moreover the remaining expense for that tranche is ratably recorded over the period remaining until the later of i the expected achievement of the relevant operational milestone if it has not yet been achieved and ii the expected achievement of the related market capitalization milestone if it has not yet been achieved Upon vesting of a tranche all remaining associated expense is recognized immediately Because the expected market capitalization achievements are generally later than the related expected operational milestone achievements the achievement of the former earlier than expected may increase the magnitude of any catchup expense andor accelerate the rate at which the remaining expense is recognized During 2020 several operational milestones became probable and several tranches vested including as a result of our market capitalization increasing rapidly resulting in the recognition or acceleration of related expense earlier than anticipated and within a relatively short period of time See Note 14 Equity Incentive Plans 2018 CEO Performance Award to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K for further details regarding the stockbased compensation relating to the 2018 CEO Performance Award As our market capitalization is unpredictable and our financial performance improves it is possible that the earlierthanplanned recognition of such expenses will continue in the near term In January 2021 we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity As part of the policy we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets Thereafter we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin under this policy Moreover we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt Digital assets are considered indefinitelived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules Accordingly any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale As we currently intend to hold these assets longterm these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase 33 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US GAAP The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures We base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period Accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be affected Due to the COVID19 pandemic there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets The estimates used for but not limited to determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements sales return reserves the collectability of accounts receivable inventory valuation fair value of longlived assets goodwill fair value of financial instruments fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10K T hese estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions Revenue Recognition Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and payperuse charges and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606 including access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity FSD features and overtheair software updates We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eightyear life of the vehicle Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer For our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available At the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns based on historical experience In addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customers lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity FSD features and overtheair software updates As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option We offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners Under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value 34 With the exception of the Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option program discussed within the Automotive Leasing section below we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicles estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customers economic incentive to exercise The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values On a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values Automotive Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuel We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive sales revenue in the consolidated statements of operations Automotive Leasing Revenue Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the US Canada and in certain countries in Europe Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months At the end of the lease term customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for Model S and Model X leases in certain regions may opt to purchase the vehicles for a predetermined residual value We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option We offered buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the US and where we expected the customer had a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception we continued to recognize these transactions as operating leases These transactions entailed a transfer of leases which we had originated with an endcustomer to our leasing partner As control of the vehicles had not been transferred in accordance with ASC 606 these transactions were accounted for as interestbearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840 Leases prior to January 1 2019 Under this program cash was received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value was generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment was recorded within deferred revenue We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate We capitalized vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheets and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement Cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease repayments borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows With the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1 2019 all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842 and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term Consequently any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows At the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue The end customer can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue 35 Direct Sales T ype Leasing Program We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as salestype leases under ASC 842 in certain countries in Asia and Europe which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020 Depending on the specific program customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term If the customer does not have a right to return the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments Under the programs for which there is a right to return the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly under these programs for up to 48 months Our loan arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the salestype lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue respectively upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customers including solar subscriptionbased arrangements Energy generation and storage sales revenue also includes revenue from agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs that commence after January 1 2019 which is recognized as earned based on the amount of capacity provided for solar energy systems or electricity delivered for PPAs at the contractual billing rates assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met Under the practical expedient available under ASC 606105518 we recognize revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering design and installation of the system Postinstallation residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a standready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and commissioned Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contractspecific phases of a project Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales Certain largescale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sales Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred 36 As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performance requirements specified in the contract In certain instances we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level Conversely if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements we may be required to pay liquidated damages Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur We record as deferred revenue any nonrefundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term Energy Generation and Storage Leasing For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1 2019 we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840 Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service fees which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which is recognized as revenue over the lease term We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs which include the referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis In addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost We record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts If our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product Once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 37 Warranties We provide a manufacturers warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations StockBased Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units RSUs granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan the ESPP to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards The fair value of stock option awards with only service andor performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the BlackScholes optionpricing model The BlackScholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP Stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period For performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable For performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of i the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize a cumulative catchup expense from the grant date to that point in time If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stockbased compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized If additional operational milestones become probable stockbased compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable including cumulative catchup expense for the service provided since the grant date The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations As we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods Stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations Income Taxes We are subject to taxes in the US and in many foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans Tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals The US many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard As of December 31 2020 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net US deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our US deferred tax assets will not be realized Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 38 Furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions In the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain As a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome These effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is likely that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities We are required to file income tax returns in the US and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810 Consolidation we consolidate any variable interest entity VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary We form VIEs with our financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with our solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as VIEs through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements We have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value HLBV method We therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries Under the HLBV method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties The third parties interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties However the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets For certain funds there may be significant fluctuations in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as timebased milestones are reached 39 Results of Operations Effects of COVID19 The COVID19 pandemic impacted our business and financial results in 2020 The temporary suspension of production at our factories during the first half of 2020 caused production limitations that together with reduced or closed government and third party partner operations in the year negatively impacted our deliveries and deployments in 2020 While we resumed operations at all of our factories worldwide our temporary suspension at our factories resulted in idle capacity charges as we still incurred fixed costs such as depreciation certain payroll related expenses and property taxes As part of our response strategy to the business disruptions and uncertainty around macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID19 pandemic we instituted cost reduction initiatives across our business globally to be commensurate to the scope of our operations while they were scaled back in the first half of 2020 This included temporary labor cost reduction measures such as employee furloughs and compensation reductions Additionally we suspended noncritical operating spend and opportunistically renegotiated supplier and vendor arrangements As part of various governmental responses to the pandemic granted to companies globally we received certain payroll related benefits which helped to reduce the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on our financial results Such payroll related benefits related to our direct headcount have been primarily netted against our disclosed idle capacity charges and they marginally reduced our operating expenses The impact of the idle capacity charges incurred during the first half of 2020 were almost entirely offset by our cost savings initiatives and payroll related benefits Revenues Year Ended December 31 2020 vs 2019 Change 2019 vs 2018 Change Dollars in millions 2020 2019 2018

Supercharger network internet connectivity FSD features and overtheair software updates as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting Our revenue from regulatory credits fluctuates depending on when a contract is executed with a buyer and when the credits are delivered Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting We began offering direct leasing for Model 3 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019 and we began offering direct leasing for Model Y vehicles in the third quarter of 2020 Additionally automotive leasing revenue includes direct salestype leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020 Services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles retail merchandise sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue 40 2020 compared to 2019 Automotive sales revenue increased 623 billion or 31 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to an increase of 129268 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries despite production limitations as a result of temporary suspension of production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada during the first half of 2020 We were able to increase deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory There was also an increase of 986 million from additional sales of regulatory credits to 158 billion in the year ended December 31 2020 Additionally due to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the year ended December 31 2019 we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that customers would exercise their buyback options and adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program which resulted in a reduction of automotive sales revenue of 555 million We made further pricing adjustments that resulted in a similar but smaller reduction of automotive sales revenue of 72 million during the year ended December 31 2020 The smaller reduction in revenue from pricing adjustments resulted in a positive impact to automotive sales revenue of 483 million year over year These factors increasing automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease in the combined average selling price of Model 3 and Model Y Despite the inclusion of higher priced Model Y deliveries in 2020 the combined average selling price of Model 3 and Model Y decreased due to a higher proportion of Model 3 Standard Range variants in our sales mix compared to the prior year Additionally there was a decrease in automotive sales revenue from 8669 fewer Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a relatively consistent combined average selling price in the year ended December 31 2020 compared to the prior year Automotive leasing revenue increased 183 million or 21 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and the introduction of direct salestype leasing programs which we began offering in volume during the third quarter of 2020 where we recognize all revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer These increases were partially offset by the decreases in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined Services and other revenue increased 80 million or 4 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to an increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow an increase in retail merchandise revenue and an increase in sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers as we had a partial year of sales in the prior year from our midyear 2019 acquisitions These increases were partially offset by a decrease in used vehicle revenue driven by a reduction in nonTesla tradeins Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives 2020 compared to 2019 Energy generation and storage revenue increased by 463 million or 30 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to increases in deployments of Megapack solar cash and loan jobs and Powerwall partially offset by a decrease in deployments of Powerpack and reduced average selling prices on our solar cash and loan jobs as a result of our low cost solar strategy Powerpack deployments have decreased following the introduction of our Megapack product which we began deploying in late 2019 41 Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Year Ended December 31 2020 vs 2019 Change 2019 vs 2018 Change Dollars in millions 2020 2019 2018

for estimated warranty expenses Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term cost of goods sold associated with direct salestype leases which were introduced in volume in the third quarter of 2020 as well as warranty expenses related to leased vehicles Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs Cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services costs to acquire and certify used vehicles costs for retail merchandise and costs to provide vehicle insurance Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers 2020 compared to 2019 Cost of automotive sales revenue increased 376 billion or 24 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to an increase of 129268 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries Due to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during the year ended December 31 2019 we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that customers would exercise their buyback options and if customers elect to exercise the buyback option we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles which resulted in a reduction of cost of automotive sales revenue of 451 million We made further pricing adjustments that resulted in a similar but smaller reduction of cost of automotive sales revenue of 42 million during the year ended December 31 2020 Additionally there was an increase to cost of automotive sales revenue from idle capacity charges of 213 million as a result of temporary suspension of production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada during the first half of 2020 These factors increasing cost of automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease in average Model 3 costs per unit due to lower material manufacturing freight and duty costs from localized procurement and manufacturing in China and a higher sales mix of lower end trims as well as a decrease of 8669 Model S and Model X cash deliveries in the year ended December 31 2020 compared to the prior year 42 Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 104 million or 23 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and the introduction of direct salestype leasing programs which we began offering in volume during the third quarter of 2020 where we recognize all cost of revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer These increases were partially offset by the decreases in cost of automotive lease revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs which are accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined Cost of services and other revenue decreased 99 million or 4 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to a decrease in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by a reduction in nonTesla tradeins partially offset by increases in nonwarranty maintenance services as our fleet continues to grow and an increase in costs of retail merchandise as our sales have increased Gross margin for total automotive increased from 21 to 26 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to an improvement of Model 3 gross margin primarily from lower material manufacturing freight and duty costs from localized procurement and manufacturing in China partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of Model 3 due to a higher proportion of Model 3 Standard Range variants in our sales mix compared to the prior year Additionally there was an increase of 986 million in sales of regulatory credits and a positive impact from Model Y deliveries in 2020 as Model Y gross margin was higher than our prior year total automotive gross margin These increases were partially offset by idle capacity charges of 213 million as a result of a temporary suspension of production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada during the first half of 2020 Gross margin for total automotive services and other segment increased from 17 to 22 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and a lower proportion of services and other which operated at a lower gross margin than our automotive business within the segment in the year ended December 31 2020 Additionally there was an improvement in our nonwarranty maintenance services gross margin due to increased operational efficiencies despite additional costs from ramping service centers to accommodate a larger deployed fleet and an improvement in our used vehicle sales gross margin Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs where we are the lessor the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs 2020 compared to 2019 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 635 million or 47 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to increases in deployments of Megapack higher costs from temporary manufacturing underutilization of our Solar Roof ramp increases in deployments of Powerwall and idle capacity charges of 20 million as a result of temporary suspension of production at Gigafactory New York during the first half of 2020 These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deployments of Powerpack Gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 12 to 1 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to a higher proportion of Solar Roof in our overall energy business which operated at lower gross margins as a result of temporary manufacturing underutilization during product ramp Additionally there were lower gross margins in our solar cash and loan business from reduced average selling prices as a result of our low cost solar strategy partially offset by lower materials and manufacturing costs

prototyping expense contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense 43 RD expenses increased 148 million or 11 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 The increase was primarily due to a 62 million increase in expensed materials as we continue to expand our product roadmap 61 million increase in stockbased compensation expense primarily related to the issuance of equity awards in fiscal year 2020 at higher grant date fair values due to our increased share price 20 million increase in facilities freight and depreciation expenses and a 20 million increase in employee and labor related expenses RD expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 55 to 47 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year

information technology and legal organizations as well as fees for professional and contract services and litigation settlements SGA expenses increased 499 million or 19 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 The increase is primarily due to an increase of 625 million in stockbased compensation expense of which 542 million was attributable to the 2018 CEO Performance Award We recorded stockbased compensation expense of 838 million in the year ended December 31 2020 for the 2018 CEO Performance Award compared to 296 million in the prior year Of the expense recorded in fiscal year 2020 232 million was due to cumulative catchup expense for the service provided from the grant date when three operational milestones under such award were considered probable of being met and the remaining unamortized expense of 357 million for the first four tranches were recognized upon vesting as the first four market capitalization milestones were achieved see Note 14 Equity Incentive Plans to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K The remaining stockbased compensation expense increase of 83 million attributable to other directors and employees is primarily related to the issuance of equity awards in fiscal year 2020 at higher grant date fair values due to our increased share price The increase in stockbased compensation was partially offset by a decrease of 90 million in customer promotional costs facilitiesrelated expenses and sales and marketing activities Additionally there was a reduction to operating expenses for costs previously incurred in the amount of 43 million for the settlement in part of the securities litigation relating to the SolarCity acquisition see Note 16 Commitments and ContingenciesLegal ProceedingsSecurities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K SGA expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 11 to 10 in year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 The decrease is primarily from an increase in total

year ended December 31 2019 primarily due to 105 million of losses on extinguishment of debt in fiscal year 2020 from early conversions on our convertible senior notes partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to a decrease in our weighted average interest rate as compared to the prior year and an increase of 17 million in the amount of interest we capitalized from the consolidated statements of operations to property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets Increased capitalization results in lower interest expense The amount of interest we capitalize is driven by our construction in progress balance which increased yearoveryear due to our construction and expansion of multiple factories Other Income Expense Net Year Ended December 31 2020 vs 2019 Change 2019

exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities and changes in the fair values of our fixedforfloating interest rate swaps We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates Other expense income net changed unfavorably by 167 million in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 The unfavorable change was primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates such as the US dollar depreciating greater than 5 against the euro and the Chinese yuan in 2020 compared to an appreciation of 2 and 1 against the same currencies in the prior year respectively Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31 2020 vs 2019 Change 2019 vs

ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 The increase was primarily due to the substantial increases in taxable profits in our foreign jurisdictions yearoveryear Our effective tax rate increased from 17 to 25 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to substantial pretax income in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to

redeemable noncontrolling interests increased by 54 million or 62 in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31 2019 The increase was primarily due to lower activities from new financing fund arrangements Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31 2020 we had 1938 billion of cash and cash equivalents Balances held in foreign currencies had a US dollar equivalent of 676 billion and consisted primarily of euros Chinese yuan and Canadian dollars Our sources of cash are 45 predominantly from our deliveries of vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities proceeds from financing funds and proceeds from equity offerings Our sources of liquidity and cash flows enable us to fund ongoing operations research and development projects for new products and technologies including our announced proprietary battery cells ongoing production and additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory Gigafactory Nevada Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York the construction of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops Mobile Service fleet Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsManagement Opportunities Challenges and Risks and 2021 OutlookCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on Form 10K we currently expect our capital expenditures to be 450 to 600 billion in 2021 and in each of the next two fiscal years We expect that the cash we generate from our core operations will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditures and to pay down our nearterm debt obligations although we may choose to seek alternative financing sources For example our local subsidiary has entered into credit facilities to support construction and production at Gigafactory Shanghai See Note 12 Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K As always we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business In January 2021 we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity As part of the policy we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets Thereafter we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin under this policy Moreover we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt We believe our bitcoin holdings are highly liquid However digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to liquidate them We have an agreement to spend or incur 50 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10year period beginning April 30 2018 which we expect to meet through our operations As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID19 pandemic we were granted a oneyear deferral of our obligation to be compliant as of April 30 2020 with our applicable targets under such agreement We expect that our current sources of liquidity together with our projection of cash flows from operating activities will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months even considering the expected levels of capital expenditures in the current and next two fiscal years A large portion of our future expenditures is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment including future expansion of our product offerings retail and service locations body shops Mobile Service fleet and Supercharger network For example if our nearterm manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected including due to global economic conditions and levels of consumer outlook and spend impacting demand in the worldwide transportation automotive and energy product industries we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures We may need or want to raise additional funds in the future and these funds may not be available to us when we need or want them or at all If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them our operations and prospects could be negatively affected In addition we had 263 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities and financing funds as of December 31 2020 some of which are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables inventories leased vehicles and our interests in those leases solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts our interests in financing funds or various other assets and contributing or selling qualified solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or qualified leased vehicles and our interests in those leases into the financing funds For details regarding our indebtedness and financing funds refer to Note 12 Debt and Note 17 Variable Interest Entity Arrangements to the

operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative and working capital especially inventory which includes vehicles in transit Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales customer lease payments customer deposits cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process operating expenses operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 354 billion to 594 billion during the year ended December 31 2020 from 240 billion during the year ended December 31 2019 This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and gains of 282 billion the decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 533 million and 188 million of the repayment of our 025 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 during the three months ended March 31 2019 which represents the portion of the repayment that was classified as an operating activity as this represented an interest payment on the deeplydiscounted convertible senior notes The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the year ended December 31 2020 as compared to the prior year from ramp up in production at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by a smaller increase in deferred revenue primarily due to delivery of regulatory credits in 2020 under a previous arrangement where we had received payment in advance as of December 31 2019 a larger increase in operating lease vehicles as Model 3 direct leasing was introduced in the second quarter of 2019 and Model Y direct leasing was introduced in the third quarter of 2020 and a larger increase in accounts receivables of government rebates already passed through to customers Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures which were 316 billion for the year ended December 31 2020 mainly for Model Y production expansion at the Fremont Factory expansion of Gigafactory Shanghai and construction of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas and 133 billion for the year ended December 31 2019 mainly for Gigafactory Shanghai construction Model 3 production ramp and Model Y preparations The increase in capital expenditures was partially offset by decreases of 32 million in business combinations net of cash acquired and 30 million of design acquisition and installation of solar energy systems when compared to the prior year Additionally we received 123 million and 46 million respectively of government grants in connection with us making certain manufacturing equipment investments at Gigafactory Shanghai for the years ended December 31 2020 and 2019 respectively Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31 2020 consisted primarily of 1227 billion from issuance of common stock in public offerings in 2020 net of issuance costs and 417 million of proceeds from exercise of stock options and other stock issuances These cash inflows were partially offset by 199 billion of cash repayments upon early conversions of our convertible senior notes 338 million principal repayments of our finance leases collateralized lease repayments of 240 million and 219 million net payments to financing fund investors See Note 12 Debt and Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K for

from the issuance of the 200 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 2024 Notes net of transaction costs and 848 million from the issuance of common stock net of underwriting discounts in registered public offerings 736 million of net borrowings under loan agreements entered into by certain Chinese subsidiaries 394 million of net borrowings for automotive assetbacked notes and 174 million from the issuance of warrants in connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes These cash inflows were partially offset by a 732 million portion of the repayment of our 025 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 that was classified as financing activity a 566 million repayment of our 1625 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 a purchase of convertible note hedges of 476 million in connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes and collateralized lease repayments of 389 million 47 Contractual Obligations We are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties including certain debt financing arrangements and leases primarily for stores service centers certain manufacturing facilities and certain corporate offices These also include as part of our normal business practices contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services and capacity reservation

customers who purchase and finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners and certain leasing partners refer to Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K The maximum amount we could be required to pay under these programs should customers exercise their resale value guarantees or buyback options would be 184 billion over the next five years of which 394 million is within a 12month period from December 31 2020 We have not included this in the table above as it is unknown how many customers will exercise their options Additionally we plan to resell any vehicles which are returned to us and therefore the actual exposure to us is deemed to be limited OffBalance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which were established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K 48 ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the US dollar primarily the Chinese yuan euro Canadian dollar and British pound in relation to our current year operations In general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the US dollar for our foreign subsidiaries Accordingly changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in US dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income loss as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances For the year ended December 31 2020 we recognized a net foreign currency loss of 114 million in other expense income net with our largest remeasurement exposures from the US dollar euro and Canadian dollar as our subsidiaries monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in various local currencies For the year ended December 31 2019 we recognized a net foreign currency gain of 48 million in other expense income net with our largest remeasurement exposures from the US dollar British pound and Canadian dollar We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the nearterm These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income loss before income taxes These changes would have resulted in a benefit of 8 million at December 31 2020 and an adverse impact of 362 million at December 31 2019 assuming no foreign currency hedging Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates Pursuant to our risk management policies in certain cases we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates on our floating rate debt would have increased or decreased our interest expense for the years ended December 31 2020 and 2019 by 4 million and 8 million respectively 49 ITEM 8

consolidated statements of operations of comprehensive income loss of redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2020 including the related notes collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO In our opinion the consolidated financial

Accounting Principles As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers in 2018 Basis for Opinions The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB We conducted our audits i n accordance with the standards of the PCAOB Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks Such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 51 Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that i relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and ii involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matters below providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate Automotive Sales To Customers With a Resale Value Guarantee or Buyback Option As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements the sales return reserve related to resale value guarantees or buyback options was 703 million as of December 31 2020 of which 202 million was shortterm The Company offers some customers resale value guarantees or buyback options Under these programs the Company receives full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and the customer has the option of selling their vehicle back to the Company during the guarantee period for a predetermined resale value In circumstances where management does not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee or buyback option provided to them at contract inception the Company recognizes revenue when control transfers upon delivery to a customer as a sale with a right of return In circumstances where management believes the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee or buyback option at contract inception the Company recognizes the transaction as an operating lease Managements determination of whether there is a significant economic incentive includes comparing a vehicles estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value Sales return reserves are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values On a quarterly basis management assesses the estimated future market values of vehicles under these programs taking into account price adjustments on vehicle offerings and changes in market conditions subsequent to the initial sale to determine the need for changes to the reserve The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to automotive sales to customers with a resale value guarantee or buyback option is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the sales return reserve when customers do not have a significant economic incentive to exercise their option this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the sales return reserve when customers do not have a significant economic incentive Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to automotive revenue recognition for sales to customers with a resale value guarantee or buyback option as well as the related sales return reserve including controls over managements estimate of expected future market values and historical experience These procedures also included among others testing managements process for determining whether customers have a significant economic incentive to exercise their put rights under the resale value guarantee and buyback option programs and if not the related sales return reserve This included evaluating the appropriateness of the model applied and the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to historical experience and the estimated expected future market values used in the comparison to guaranteed resale amounts Evaluating assumptions related to historical experience and estimated expected future market values involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering current and past performance and consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit Procedures were performed to evaluate the reliability completeness and relevance of managements data used in the development of the historical experience assumption Automotive Warranty Reserve As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements total accrued warranty which primarily relates to the automotive segment was 1468 million as of December 31 2020 The Company provides a manufacturers warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles As described in Note 2 a warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold which includes managements best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty including recalls when identified These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims 52 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the warranty reserve this in turn led to significant auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate the estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements estimate of the automotive warranty reserve including controls over managements estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date These procedures also included among others testing managements process for determining the automotive warranty reserve This included evaluating the appropriateness of the model applied and the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty Evaluating the assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering current and past performance including a lookback analysis comparing prior period forecasted claims to actual claims incurred These procedures also included developing an independent estimate of a portion of the warranty accrual comparing the independent estimate to managements estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate and testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims Procedures were performed to test the reliability completeness and relevance of managements data related to the historical claims processed and that such claims were appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of aspects of managements model for estimating the nature and frequency of future claims and testing

or our was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1 2003 We design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and design manufacture install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage products Our Chief Executive Officer as the chief operating decision maker CODM organizes our company manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments i automotive and ii energy generation and storage As of and following December 31 2020 there has continued to be widespread impact from the coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic In 2020 we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of the year Some of our suppliers and partners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming including Panasonic which manufactures battery cells for our products at our Gigafactory Nevada We also instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our US operations were scaled back Finally reduced operations or closures at motor vehicle departments vehicle auction houses and municipal and utility company inspectors resulted in challenges in or postponements for our new vehicle deliveries used vehicle sales and energy product deployments By the second half of 2020 however we resumed operations at all of our manufacturing facilities and have continued to increase our output and add additional capacity and work with each of our suppliers and government agencies on meeting ramping and sustaining our production On the other hand certain government regulations and shifting social behaviors have continued to limit or close nonessential transportation government functions business activities and persontoperson interactions In some cases the relaxation of such trends has recently been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce We cannot predict the duration or direction of such trends which have also adversely affected and may in the future affect our operations On February 19 2020 we completed a public offering of our common stock and issued a total of 152 million shares as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split as described in the paragraph below for total cash proceeds of 231 billion net of underwriting discounts and offering costs of 28 million On August 10 2020 our Board of Directors declared a five forone split of the Companys common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend the Stock Split Each stockholder of record on August 21 2020 received a dividend of four additional shares of common stock for each thenheld share distributed after close of trading on August 28 2020 All share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the Stock Split On September 1 2020 we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with certain sales agents to sell 500 billion in shares of our common stock from time to time through an atthemarket offering program Such sales were completed by September 4 2020 and settled by September 9 2020 with the sale of 11141562 shares of common stock resulting in gross proceeds of 500 billion and net proceeds of 497 billion net of sales agents commissions of 25 million and other offering costs of 1 million On December 8 2020 we entered into a separate Equity Distribution Agreement with certain sales agents to sell 500 billion in shares of our common stock from time to time through an atthemarket offering program Such sales were completed by December 9 2020 and settled by December 11 2020 with the sale of 7915589 shares of common stock resulting in gross proceeds of 500 billion and net proceeds of 499 billion net of sales agents commissions of 13 million and other offering costs of 1 million 59 Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 810 Consolidation we consolidate any variable interest entity VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary We form VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as VIEs through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs see Note 17 Variable Interest Entity Arrangements We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes Due to the COVID19 pandemic there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets The estimates used for but not limited to determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements sales return reserves the collectability of accounts receivable inventory valuation fair value of longlived assets goodwill fair value of financial instruments fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10K These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions Reclassifications Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes Restricted cash and MyPower customer notes receivable have been reclassified to other assets and resale value guarantees has been reclassified to other liabilities Revenue Recognition Adoption of ASC 606 revenue standard On January 1 2018 we adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the

guarantee 24053 19212 15810 Automotive sales with resale value guarantee 1 551 146 1403 Automotive regulatory credits 1580 594 419 Energy generation and storage sales 1477 1000 1056 Services and other 2306 2226 1391 Total revenues from sales and services 29967 23178 20079 Automotive leasing 1052 869 883 Energy generation and storage leasing 517 531 499 Total revenues 31536 24578 21461 1 Due to pricing adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2020 and 2019 we estimated that there was a greater likelihood that customers would exercise their buyback options and adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program which resulted in a reduction of automotive sales with resale value guarantee For the years ended December 31 2020 and 2019 price adjustments resulted in a reduction of automotive sales with resale value guarantee by 72 million and 555 million respectively The amounts presented represent automotive sales with resale value guarantee net of such pricing adjustments impact Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and payperuse charges and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606 including access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity Full SelfDriving FSD features and overtheair software updates We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eightyear life of the vehicle Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer For our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available At the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented In addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customers lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity FSD features and overtheair software updates As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts 61 Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option We offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners Under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value With the exception of the Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option program discussed within the Automotive Leasing section below we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicles estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customers economic incentive to exercise The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values On a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values Due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2020 we estimated that there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options that were provided prior to such adjustments As a result along with the estimated variable consideration related to normal future product returns for vehicles sold under the buyback options program we adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of 72 million for the year ended December 31 2020 If customers elect to exercise the buyback option we expect to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles which resulted in a corresponding reduction in cost of automotive sales of 42 million for the year ended December 31 2020 The net impact was 30 million reduction in gross profit for the year ended December 31 2020 The total sales return reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program was 703 million and 639 million as of December 31 2020 and December 31 2019 respectively of which 202 million and 93 million was short term respectively Deferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity FSD features and overtheair software updates on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the following in millions Year ended December 31 2020 2019 Deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee beginning of period 1472 883 Additions 724 880 Net changes in liability for preexisting contracts 56 9 Revenue recognized 326 300 Deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee end of period 1926 1472 Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of December 31 2020 From the deferred revenue balance as of December 31 2019 revenue recognized during the year ended December 31 2020 was 283 million From the deferred revenue balance as of December 31 2018 revenue recognized during the year ended December 31 2019 was 220 million Of the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees as of December 31 2020 we expect to recognize 113 billion of revenue in the next 12 months The remaining balance will be recognized over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to zeroemission vehicles greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuel We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements 62 Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive sales revenue in the consolidated statements of operations Revenue from the sale of automotive regulatory credits totaled 158 billion 594 million and 419 million for the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was 21 million and 140 million as of December 31 2020 and 2019 respectively We expect to recognize the majority of the deferred revenue as of December 31 2020 in the next 12 months Automotive Leasing Revenue Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the US Canada and in certain countries in Europe Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months At the end of the lease term customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for Model S and Model X leases in certain regions may opt to purchase the vehicles for a predetermined residual value We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue For the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we recognized 752 million 532 million and 393 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue respectively As of December 31 2020 and 2019 we had deferred 293 million and 218 million respectively of leaserelated upfront payments which will be recognized on a straightline basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option We offered buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the US and where we expected the customer had a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception we continued to recognize these transactions as operating leases These transactions entailed a transfer of leases which we had originated with an endcustomer to our leasing partner As control of the vehicles had not been transferred in accordance with ASC 606 these transactions were accounted for as interestbearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840 Leases prior to January 1 2019 Under this program cash was received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value was generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment was recorded within deferred revenue We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate The option period expires at the earlier of the end of the contractual option period or the payoff of the initial loan We capitalized vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles net on the consolidated balance sheets and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement Cash received for these vehicles net of revenue recognized during the period is classified as collateralized lease repayments borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows Following the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1 2019 all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term Consequently any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows At the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue The end customer can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program should we decide to repurchase all vehicles was 42 million and 214 million as of December 31 2020 and 2019 respectively including 23 million within a 12month period from December 31 2020 As of December 31 2020 and 2019 we had 42 million and 238 million respectively of such borrowings recorded in accrued liabilities and other and other longterm liabilities and 11 million and 29 million respectively recorded in deferred revenue liability For the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we recognized 77 million 186 million and 332 million respectively of leasing revenue related to this program The net carrying amount of operating lease vehicles under this program was 43 million and 190 million respectively as of December 31 2020 and 2019 63 Direct SalesType Leasing Program We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as salestype leases under ASC 842 in certain countries in Asia and Europe which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020 Depending on the specific program customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term If the customer does not have a right to return the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments Under the programs for which there is a right to return the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly under these programs for up to 48 months Our loan arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the salestype lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue respectively upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis For the year ended December 31 2020 we recognized 120 million of salestype leasing revenue and 87 million of salestype leasing cost of revenue Services and Other Revenue Services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles retail merchandise sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a standready obligation to the customer We sell used vehicles services service plans vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations Payment for used vehicles services and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets Deferred revenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31 2020 and 2019 Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customers Energy generation and storage sales revenue also includes revenue from agreements for solar energy systems and power purchase agreements PPAs that commence after January 1 2019 which is recognized as earned based on the amount of capacity provided for solar energy systems or electricity delivered for PPAs at the contractual billing rates assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met Under the practical expedient available under ASC 606105518 we recognize revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering design and installation of the system Post installation residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a standready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and commissioned Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contractspecific phases of a project Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales Certain largescale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sales Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance 64 In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using market data for comparable products Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets A ny fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performance requirements specified in the contract In certain instances we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level Conversely if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements we may be required to pay liquidated damages Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur We record as deferred revenue any nonrefundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term As of December 31 2020 and 2019 deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to 187 million and 156 million respectively Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31 2019 was 34 million for the year ended December 31 2020 Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31 2018 was 41 million for the year ended December 31 2019 We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date As of December 31 2020 total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was 100 million Of this amount we expect to recognize 6 million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up to 27 years Energy Generation and Storage Leasing For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1 2019 we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840 Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service fees which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term As of December 31 2020 and 2019 deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to 206 million and 226 million respectively Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which is recognized as revenue over the lease term As of December 31 2020 and 2019 deferred revenue from rebates and incentives amounted to 29 million and 36 million respectively We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs which include the referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements 65 Cost of Revenues Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand Automotive Leasing Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term cost of goods sold associated with direct salestype leases as well as warranty expenses related to leased vehicles Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs Services and Other Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services costs to acquire and certify used vehicles costs for retail merchandise and costs to provide vehicle insurance Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs where we are the lessor the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs Leases We adopted ASC 842 Leases as of January 1 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach adoption of the new lease standard In addition we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard which allowed us to carry forward the historical determination of contracts as leases lease classification and not reassess initial direct costs for historical lease arrangements Accordingly previously reported financial statements including footnote disclosures have not been recast to reflect the application of the new standard to all comparative periods presented The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840 Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred Marketing Promotional and Advertising Costs Marketing promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations Marketing promotional and advertising costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 Income Taxes Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 66 We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA subjects a US shareholder to tax on global intangible lowtaxed income GILTI earned by certain foreign subsidiaries Under GAAP we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes We elected the deferred method under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets currently subject to valuation allowance Comprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss Other comprehensive income loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments that have been excluded from the determination of net income loss StockBased Compensation We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all sharebased payments including stock options restricted stock units RSUs and our employee stock purchase plan the ESPP The fair value of stock option awards with only service andor performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the BlackScholes optionpricing model The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock Stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period net of actual forfeitures in the period For performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable For performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of i the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize a cumulative catchup expense from the grant date to that point in time If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stockbased compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations see Note 14 Equity Incentive Plans As we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods Stockbased compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenues research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 67 Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements We have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value HLBV method We therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries Under the HLBV method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties The third parties interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties However the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets For certain funds there may be significant fluctuations in the ending balance of redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries and net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as timebased milestones are reached Net Income Loss per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders Basic net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income loss attributable to common stockholders by the weightedaverage shares of common stock outstanding for the period During the year ended December 31 2020 we decreased net income attributable to common stockholders by 31 million to arrive at the numerator used to calculate net income per share During the year ended December 31 2019 we increased net loss attributable to common stockholders by 8 million to arrive at the numerator used to calculate net loss per share These adjustments represent the difference between the cash we paid to the financing fund investors for their noncontrolling interest in our subsidiaries and the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings per Share Potentially dilutive shares which are based on the weightedaverage shares of common stock underlying outstanding stockbased awards warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the ifconverted method as applicable are included when calculating diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive Since we intend to settle or have settled in cash the principal outstanding under our 025 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 2019 Notes 125 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021 2021 Notes 2375 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 2022 Notes 2024 Notes and our subsidiarys 550 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 we use the treasury stock method applied using our average share price during the period when calculating their potential dilutive effect if any Furthermore in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants see Note 12 Debt However our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always antidilutive Warrants which have a strike price above our average share price during the period were out of the money and were not included in the tables below Warrants will be included in the weightedaverage shares used in computing basic net income loss per share of common stock in the periods they are settled The following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split in millions Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Weighted average shares used in computing net income loss per share of common stock basic 933 887 853 Add Stockbased awards 66 Convertible senior notes 47 Warrants 37 Weighted average shares used in computing net income loss per share of common stock diluted 1083 887 853 68 The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders because their effect was antidilutive in millions Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Stockbased awards 2 50 50 Convertible senior notes 1 5 7 Warrants 1 Business Combinations We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805 Business Combinations The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred Identifiable assets including intangible assets liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents Our cash equivalents are primarily comprised of money market funds Restricted Cash We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash as collateral for our sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee letters of credit real estate leases insurance policies credit card borrowing facilities and certain operating leases In addition restricted cash includes cash received from certain fund investors that have not been released for use by us and cash held to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and determine current or noncurrent classification based on the expected duration of the restriction Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows was as follows in millions December 31

noncurrent assets 279 269 398 Total as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 19901 6783 4277 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers sales of energy generation and storage products sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers government rebates already passed through to customers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible We writeoff accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible 69 Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter is dependent on contractual payment terms Additionally government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period MyPower Customer Notes Receivable We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program MyPower was offered by one of our subsidiaries to provide residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30 year loan The outstanding balances net of any allowance for credit losses are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as other noncurrent assets for the longterm portion We adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments Credit Losses on January 1 2020 on a modified retrospective basis Under ASC 326 expected credit loss for customer notes receivable are measured on a collective basis and are determined as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of cash flows expected to be collected In determining expected credit losses we consider our historical level of credit losses current economic trends and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows We writeoff customer notes receivable when they are deemed uncollectible and the amount of potentially uncollectible amounts has been insignificant Using a modified retrospective approach for the impact upon adoption we recorded an increase to the allowance for credit losses of 37 million on January 1 2020 with an offset to accumulated deficit As of December 31 2020 and 2019 the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable net of allowance for credit losses was 334 million and 402 million respectively of which 9 million was due in the next 12 months as of December 31 2020 and 2019 respectively As of December 31 2020 the allowance for credit losses was 45 million In addition there were no material nonaccrual or past due customer notes receivable as of December 31 2020 Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash cash equivalents restricted cash accounts receivable convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the US These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits As of December 31 2020 and 2019 no entity represented 10 or more of our total accounts receivable balance The risk of concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highlyrated multinational banks Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers the majority of which are single source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results Although all of our manufacturing facilities are operational and we continue to increase our output and add additional capacity and are working with each of our suppliers and government agencies on meeting ramping and sustaining our production our ability to sustain this trajectory depends among other things on the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors through any macroeconomic factors resulting from the COVID19 pandemic Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis In addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost We record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts If our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product Once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results 70 Operating Lease Vehicles Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program and vehicles delivered to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback option where there is significant economic incentive to exercise at contract inception are classified as operating lease vehicles as the related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases under ASC 842 refer to the Automotive Leasing Revenue section above for details Operating lease vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation We generally depreciate their value less salvage value using the straightlinemethod to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31 2020 and 2019 was 354 billion and 285 billion respectively Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of 446 million and 406 million as of December 31 2020 and 2019 respectively Solar Energy Systems Net We are the lessor of solar energy systems Prior to January 1 2019 these leases were accounted for as operating leases in accordance with ASC 840 Under ASC 840 to determine lease classification we evaluated the lease terms to determine whether there was a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease whether the lease term was greater than 75 of the useful life or whether the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 90 of the fair value at lease inception Agreements for solar energy system leases and PPAs that commence after January 1 2019 no longer meet the definition of a lease upon the adoption of ASC 842 and are instead accounted for in accordance with ASC 606 We utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful lives and fair values at lease inception and residual values at lease termination Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows Solar energy systems in service 30 to 35 years Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs Lease term up to 25 years Solar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they have been interconnected and placed inservice Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation which will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they are completed interconnected and placed in service Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements Property Plant and Equipment net Property plant and equipment net including leasehold improvements are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation is generally computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows Machinery equipment vehicles and office furniture 2 to 12 years Building and building improvements 15 to 30 years Computer equipment and software 3 to 10 years Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straightline basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases Upon the retirement or sale of our property plant and equipment the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction Capitalized interest on constructioninprogress is included within property plant and equipment net and is amortized over the life of the related assets 71 LongLived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets We review our property plant and equipment solar energy systems longterm prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate If the asset is not recoverable its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its fair value For the year ended December 31 2020 we have recognized no material impairments of our longlived assets For the years ended December 31 2019 and 2018 we have recognized certain impairments of our longlived assets refer to Note 22 Restructuring and Other for further details Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives which range from one to thirty years Goodwill We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired by comparing its carrying value to the reporting units fair value For the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we had no t recognized any impairment of goodwill Capitalization of Software Costs For costs incurred in development of internal use software we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage to property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets Costs related to preliminary project activities and postimplementation activities are expensed as incurred Internal use software is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life of three years We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets Foreign Currency We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in which they operate In cases where the functional currency is not the US dollar we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet For each subsidiary we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the monthend functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other expense income net in the consolidated statements of operations For the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of 114 million gains of 48 million and gains of 2 million respectively 72 Warranties We provide a manufacturers warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when identified These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations Due to the magnitude of our automotive business accrued warranty balance was primarily related to our automotive segment Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following in millions Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Accrued warrantybeginning of period 1089 748 402 Warranty costs incurred 312 250 209 Net changes in liability for preexisting warranties including expirations and foreign exchange impact 66 36 26 Additional warranty accrued from adoption of ASC 606 37 Provision for warranty 625 555 544 Accrued warrantyend of period 1468 1089 748 Solar Renewable Energy Credits We account for Solar Renewable Energy Certificates SRECs when they are purchased by us or sold to third parties For SRECs generated by solar energy systems owned by us and minted by government agencies we do not recognize any specifically identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental costs incurred to generate the SRECs We recognize revenue within the energy generation and storage segment from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer and the cost of the SREC if any is then recorded to energy generation and storage cost of revenue Nevada Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to 1950 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada These incentives are available until June 2024 or June 2034 depending on the incentive As of December 31 2020 and 2019 we had earned the maximum of 195 million of transferable tax credits under these agreements Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas we entered into a 20 year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 70 80 of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10 year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas As of December 31 2020 we had no t yet received any grant funding related to property taxes paid to Travis County 73 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In December 2019 the FASB issued ASU No 201912 Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards The amendments in the ASU include removing exceptions to incremental intraperiod tax allocation of losses and gains from different financial statement components exceptions to the method of recognizing income taxes on interim period losses and exceptions to deferred tax liability recognition related to foreign subsidiary investments In addition the ASU requires that entities recognize franchise tax based on an incremental method and requires an entity to evaluate the accounting for stepups in the tax basis of goodwill as inside or outside of a business combination The amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15 2020 including interim periods therein Early adoption of the standard is permitted including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued We have not early adopted this ASU as of December 31 2020 The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements In March 2020 the FASB issued ASU No 202004 Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting Topic 848 The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate eg LIBOR reform if certain criteria are met for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting The ASU is effective as of March 12 2020 through December 31 2022 We will evaluate transactions or contract modifications occurring as a result of reference rate reform and determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements In August 2020 the FASB issued ASU 202006 Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470 20 DebtDebt with Conversion and Other Options for convertible instruments The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paidin capital such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835 Interest Further the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible instruments the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the ifconverted method for diluted EPS calculation and no longer allowing the net share settlement method The ASU also made revisions to Topic 81540 which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting The amendments to Topic 81540 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2021 with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15 2020 Adoption of the ASU can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis We will adopt the ASU on January 1 2021 on a modified retrospective basis The adoption is expected to reduce additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes mezzanine equity by approximately 475 million and 50 million respectively for the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding which was initially separated and recorded in equity remove the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation for approximately 269 million and reduce property plant and equipment for previously capitalized interest by approximately 45 million as a result The net effect of these adjustments will be recorded as a reduction in the balance of our opening accumulated deficit as of January 1 2021 We currently expect the adoption of the ASU will result in the reduction of noncash interest expense for the year ending December 31 2021 and until the affected notes have been settled before the impact of reduction of our interest capitalization which is not expected to be material The reduction of depreciation expense through cost of goods sold is not expected to be material for the year ending December 31 2021 These reduced expenses will increase the income attributable to common stockholders for both basic and diluted earnings per share The required use of the if converted method is not expected to have a significant impact on the calculation of common share equivalents included in the measure of our diluted earnings per share for our 2021 Notes 2022 Notes 2024 Notes and our subsidiarys 550 Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 The amendments to the derivative accounting guidance are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements The adoption will have no impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows 74 Recently adopted accounting pronouncements In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 201613 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments to require financial assets carried at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical experience current conditions and forecasts Subsequently the FASB issued ASU No 201819 Codification Improvements to Topic 326 to clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting standards Further the FASB issued ASU No 201904 ASU No 201905 ASU 201910 ASU 201911 ASU 202002 and ASU 202003 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified retrospective basis We adopted the ASUs on January 1 2020 The ASUs did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements ASU No 201613 applies to all financial assets including loans trade receivables and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact except on MyPower customer notes receivable Refer to MyPower Customer Notes Receivable above for further details In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU No 201704 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 An entity will therefore perform the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1 2020 The ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements In August 2018 the FASB issued ASU No 201815 Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that Is a Service Contract The ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internaluse software and hosting arrangements that include an internaluse software license We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1 2020 The ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements Note 3 Business Combinations For the year ended December 31 2020 we completed various acquisitions for which consideration was immaterial on an individual basis and in aggregate Maxwell Acquisition On May 16 2019 the Acquisition Date we completed our strategic acquisition of Maxwell Technologies Inc Maxwell an energy storage and power delivery products company for its complementary technology and workforce Pursuant to the related Agreement and Plan of Merger each issued and outstanding share of Maxwell common stock was converted into 00965 the Exchange Ratio shares of our common stock as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split In addition Maxwells stock option awards and restricted stock unit awards were assumed by us and converted into corresponding equity awards in respect of our common stock based on the Exchange Ratio with the awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the acquisition Fair Value of Purchase Consideration The Acquisition Date fair value of the purchase consideration was 207 million as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split 4514840 shares issued at 4590 per share the opening price of our common stock on the Acquisition Date Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed We accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations under ASC 805 Business Combinations The total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions The judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives and the expected future cash flows and related discount rates can materially impact our consolidated financial statements Significant inputs used for the model included the amount of cash flows the expected period of the cash flows and the discount rates 75 The allocation of the purchase price was based on managements estimate of the Acquisition Date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows in millions Assets acquired Cash and cash equivalents 32 Accounts receivable 24 Inventory 32 Property plant and equipment net 27 Operating lease rightofuse assets 10 Intangible assets 105 Prepaid

noncurrent 44 Deferred revenue current 1 Other longterm liabilities 14 Additional paidin capital 8 Total liabilities and equity assumed 105 Net assets acquired 128 Goodwill 79 Total purchase price 207 Goodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and was primarily attributable to the expected synergies from integrating Maxwells technology into our automotive segment as well as the acquired talent Goodwill is not deductible for US income tax purposes and is not amortized Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired The determination of the fair value of identified intangible assets and their respective useful lives were as follows in millions except for estimated useful life Fair Value Useful Life in years Developed technology 102 9 Customer

operations have not been presented because they were not material to the consolidated financial statements Other 2019 Acquisitions During the year ended December 31 2019 we completed various other acquisitions generally for the related technology and workforce Total consideration for these acquisitions was 96 million of which 80 million was paid in cash In aggregate 36 million was attributed to intangible assets 51 million was attributed to goodwill within the automotive segment and 9 million was attributed to net assets assumed Goodwill is not deductible for US income tax purposes The identifiable intangible assets were related to purchased technology with estimated useful lives of one to nine years Standalone and pro forma results of operations have not been presented because they were not material to the consolidated financial statements either individually or in aggregate Note 4 Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill increased 9 million within the automotive segment from 198 million as of December 31 2019 to 207 million as of December 31 2020 due to completed business combinations and foreign currency translation adjustments during the year ended December 31 2020 There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31 2020 and 2019 76 Information regarding our intangible assets including assets recognized from our acquisitions was as follows in millions

of Financial Instruments ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements states that fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants As such fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability The threetiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value is comprised of Level I observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets Level II inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and Level III unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows in millions December 31 2020 December 31 2019 Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Money market funds cash and cash equivalents 13847 13847 1632 1632 Interest rate

were valued using quoted prices in active markets Our interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using alternative pricing sources or models that utilized market observable inputs including current and forward interest rates Interest Rate Swaps We enter into fixedforfloating interest rate swap agreements to swap variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments as required by certain of our lenders We do not designate our interest rate swaps as hedging instruments Accordingly our interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets within other noncurrent assets or other longterm liabilities with any changes in their fair values recognized as other expense income net in the consolidated statements of operations and with any cash flows recognized as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows Our interest rate swaps outstanding were as follows in

Senior Notes due in 2022 collectively referred to as Convertible Senior Notes below 530 Senior Notes due in 2025 2025 Notes solar assetbacked notes and solar loanbacked notes approximate their fair values We estimate the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2025 Notes using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and marketbased risk measurements that are indirectly observable such as credit risk Level II In addition we estimate the fair values of our solar assetbacked notes and solar loanbacked notes based on rates currently offered for instruments with similar maturities and terms Level III The following table presents the estimated fair values and the carrying values in millions December 31 2020 December 31 2019 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value

Leases We have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain of our offices manufacturing and warehouse facilities retail and service locations equipment vehicles and solar energy systems worldwide We determine if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor We have lease agreements with lease and nonlease components and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and nonlease components together as a single combined lease component from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct salestype leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements From a lessor perspective the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the nonlease components and associated lease component and the lease component if accounted for separately would be classified as an operating lease We have elected not to present shortterm leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments Our leases where we are the lessee often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years Some of our leases also include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term For purposes of calculating lease liabilities lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases commencing after January 1 2019 For historical leases we used the index or rate as of January 1 2019 Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term in interest expense The balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee

shares under the ESPP as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split There were 343 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31 2020 Fair Value Assumptions We use the fair value method in recognizing stockbased compensation expense Under the fair value method we estimate the fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the BlackScholes option pricing model The weightedaverage assumptions used in the BlackScholes model for stock options are as follows Year Ended December 31 2020

have been adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split See Note 1 Overview for details The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock The riskfree interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield for zerocoupon US Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grants expected life We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock 92 2018 CEO Performance Award In March 2018 our stockholders approved the Board of Directors grant of 1013 million stock option awards to our CEO the 2018 CEO Performance Award as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both i the market capitalization milestone for such tranche which begins at 1000 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of 500 billion thereafter based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average counting only trading days has been achieved and ii any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income loss attributable to common stockholders before interest expense provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation Upon vesting and exercise including the payment of the exercise price of 7001 per share as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years postexercise other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding The achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31 2020 was as follows Total Annualized Revenue Annualized Adjusted EBITDA Milestone in billions Achievement Status Milestone in billions Achievement Status 200 Achieved and certified 15 Achieved and certified 350 Probable 30 Achieved and certified 550 45 Achieved and certified 750 60 Probable 1000 80 Probable 1250 100 1500 120 1750 140 Stockbased compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represents a noncash expense and is recorded as a selling general and administrative operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations In each quarter since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award we have recognized expense generally on a prorated basis for only the number of tranches up to the maximum of 12 tranches that corresponds to the number of operational milestones that have been achieved or have been determined probable of being achieved in the future in accordance with the following principles On the grant date a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each tranche i a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and ii the future time when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved or its expected market capitalization milestone achievement time Separately based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance each quarter we determine whether it is probable that we will achieve each operational milestone that has not previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement and if so the future time when we expect to achieve that operational milestone or its expected operational milestone achievement time When we first determine that an operational milestone has become probable of being achieved we allocate the entire expense for the related tranche over the number of quarters between the grant date and the thenapplicable expected vesting time The expected vesting time at any given time is the later of i the expected operational milestone achievement time if the related operational milestone has not yet been achieved and ii the expected market capitalization milestone achievement time if the related market capitalization milestone has not yet been achieved We immediately recognize a catchup expense for all accumulated expense for the quarters from the grant date through the quarter in which the operational milestone was first deemed probable of being achieved Each quarter thereafter we recognize the prorated portion of the thenremaining expense for the tranche based on the number of quarters between such quarter and the thenapplicable expected vesting time except that upon vesting of a tranche all remaining expense for that tranche is immediately recognized As a result we have experienced and may experience in the future significant catchup expenses in quarters when one or more operational milestones are first determined to be probable of being achieved Additionally the expected market capitalization achievement times are generally later than the related expected operational milestone achievement times Therefore if market capitalization milestones are achieved earlier than originally forecasted for example due to periods of rapid stock price appreciation this has resulted and may result in the future in higher catchup expenses and the remaining expenses being recognized over shorter periods of time at a higher perquarter rate 93 During the three months ended June 30 2020 the first tranche of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that the market capitalization milestone of 1000 billion and the operational milestone of 200 billion annualized revenue had been achieved Therefore the remaining unamortized expense of 22 million for that tranche which was previously expected to be recognized ratably in future quarters as determined on the grant date was accelerated into the second quarter of 2020 Additionally the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of 45 billion became probable of being achieved during the second quarter of 2020 and consequently we recognized a catchup expense of 79 million in that quarter During the three months ended September 30 2020 the second and third tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that the market capitalization milestones of 1500 billion and 2000 billion and the operational milestones of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of 15 billion and annualized Adjusted EBITDA of 30 billion had been achieved Therefore the remaining unamortized expense of 95 million and 118 million associated with the second and third tranches respectively which were previously expected to be recognized ratably in future quarters as determined on the grant date were accelerated into the third quarter of 2020 Additionally the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of 60 billion became probable of being achieved during the third quarter of 2020 and consequently we recognized a catchup expense of 77 million in that quarter During the three months ended December 31 2020 the fourth tranche of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that the market capitalization milestone of 2500 billion and the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of 45 billion had been achieved Therefore the remaining unamortized expense of 122 million for that tranche which was previously expected to be recognized ratably in future quarters through the third quarter of 2023 as determined on the grant date was accelerated into the fourth quarter of 2020 Additionally during the fourth quarter of 2020 the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of 80 billion became probable of being achieved and consequently we recognized a catchup expense of 75 million in that quarter As of December 31 2020 we had 264 million of total unrecognized stockbased compensation expense for the operational milestones that were considered either probable of achievement or achieved but not yet certified which will be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 06 years As of December 31 2020 we had unrecognized stockbased compensation expense of 712 million for the operational milestones that were considered not probable of achievement For the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 838 million 296 million and 175 million related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award 2014 PerformanceBased Stock Option Awards In 2014 to create incentives for continued longterm success beyond the Model S program and to closely align executive pay with

purchase an aggregate of 54 million shares of our common stock as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split Each award consisted of the following four vesting tranches with the vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the future performance milestones assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date 14 th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model X

stockbased compensation expense as each performance milestone becomes probable of achievement As of December 31 2020 we had unrecognized stockbased compensation expense of 4 million for the performance milestone that was considered not probable of achievement For the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we did no t record any additional stockbased compensation related to the 2014 PerformanceBased Stock Option Awards 94 2012 CEO Performance Award In August 2012 our Board of Directors granted 264 million stock option awards to our CEO the 2012 CEO Performance Award as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split The 2012 CEO Performance Award consists of 10 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date Each vesting tranche requires a combination of a predetermined performance milestone and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of 400 billion as compared to our initial market capitalization of 320 billion at the time of grant As of December 31 2020 the market capitalization conditions for all of the vesting tranches and the following performance milestones had been achieved Successful completion of the Model X alpha prototype Successful completion of the Model X beta prototype Completion of the

liabilities net of valuation allowance and deferred tax assets 84 35 96 As of December 31 2020 we recorded a valuation allowance of 293 billion for the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by 974 million increased by 150 million and decreased by 38 million during the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to additional US deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year We have net 260 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions which management believes are morelikelythannot to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions We did not have material release of valuation allowance for the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 We continue to monitor the realizability of the US deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors including the results of operations and magnitude of excess tax deductions for stockbased compensation We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our US deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances Given the improvement in our operating results and depending on the amount of stockbased compensation tax deduction available in the future we may release the valuation allowance associated with the US deferred tax assets in the next few years Release of all or a portion of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded The reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 was as follows in millions Year Ended December 31 2020 2019 2018 Tax at statutory federal rate 242 139 211 State tax net of federal benefit 4 5 3 Nondeductible executive compensations 184 62 39 Other nondeductible expenses 52 32 26 Excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation 666 7 44 Foreign income rate differential 33 189 161 US tax credits 181 107 80 Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests adjustment 5 29 32 GILTI inclusion 133 Convertible debt 4 Unrecognized tax benefits 1 17 1 Change in valuation allowance 485 91 131 Provision for income taxes 292 110 58 As of December 31 2020 we had 965 billion of federal and 660 billion of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 2031 for state purposes A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity and some of the companies we acquired and therefore are subject to change of control provisions which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year We do not expect these change of control limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes As of December 31 2020 we had research and development tax credits of 417 million and 373 million for federal and state income tax purposes respectively If not utilized the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024 However the state of California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely In addition we have other general business tax credits of 167 million for federal income tax purposes which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033 Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to prior ownership changes The local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15 to certain eligible enterprises compared to the 25 statutory corporate income tax rate in China Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this beneficial income tax rate of 15 for 2019 through 2023 No deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been recorded relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial 97 Uncertain Tax Positions The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows in millions December 31 2017 199 Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions 6 Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 60 December 31 2018 253 Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions 39 Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 59 December 31 2019 273 Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions 66 Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 41 December 31 2020 380 As of December 31 2020 accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and were immaterial Unrecognized tax benefits of 353 million if recognized would not affect our effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance We file income tax returns in the US California and various state and foreign jurisdictions We are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2015 to 2018 Additional tax years within the period 2004 to 2014 and 2019 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes and tax years 2004 to 2019 remain subject to examination for California income tax purposes All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for US federal and California income tax purposes Tax years 2008 to 2019 remain subject to examination in other US state and foreign jurisdictions The potential outcome of the current examination could result in a change to unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months However we cannot reasonably estimate possible adjustments at this time The US Tax Court issued a decision in Altera Corp v Commissioner related to the treatment of stockbased compensation expense in a costsharing arrangement On June 7 2019 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Ninth Circuit reversed the Tax Court decision and upheld the validity of Treas Reg Section 14827Ad2 requiring stockbased compensation costs be included in the costs shared under a cost sharing agreement On June 22 2020 the US Supreme Court denied to review the Ninth Circuit decision Prior to the US Supreme Courts denial Tesla has already included stockbased compensation in cost sharing allocation agreement and hence retains its position Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the State University of New York the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York Under the lease and a related research and development agreement we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility The SUNY Foundation covered i construction costs related to the manufacturing facility up to 350 million ii the acquisition and commissioning of the manufacturing equipment in an amount up to 275 million and iii 125 million for additional specified scope costs in cases i and ii only subject to the maximum funding allocation from the State of New York and we were responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amounts The SUNY Foundation owns the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment purchased by the SUNY Foundation Following completion of the manufacturing facility we have commenced leasing of the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment owned by the SUNY Foundation for an initial period of 10 years with an option to renew for 200 per year plus utilities Under this agreement we are obligated to among other things meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo New York and spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10year period beginning April 30 2018 On an annual basis during the initial lease term as measured on each anniversary of such date if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements then we would be obligated to pay a 41 million program payment to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements Furthermore if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us then additional amounts may become payable by us 98 As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID19 pandemic we were granted a oneyear deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets under such agreement on April 30 2020 which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in July 2020 Moreover we had exceeded our investment and employment obligations under this agreement prior to such mandated reduction of operations We do not currently expect any issues meeting all applicable future obligations under this agreement However if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect we may incur additional expenses or substantial payments to the SUNY Foundation Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai China We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai Under the terms of the arrangement we are required to spend RMB 1408 billion in capital expenditures and to generate RMB 223 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023 If we are unwilling or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project approvals in accordance with the Chinese governments standard terms for such arrangements we would be required to revert the site to the local government and receive compensation for the remaining value of the land lease buildings and fixtures We believe the capital expenditure requirement and the tax revenue target will be attainable even if our actual vehicle production was far lower than the volumes we are forecasting Legal Proceedings Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition Between September 1 2016 and October 5 2016 seven lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation SolarCity Following consolidation the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Teslas board of directors as then constituted and alleges among other things that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks among other relief unspecified monetary damages attorneys fees and costs On January 27 2017 defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint Rather than respond to the defendants motion the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint On March 17 2017 defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint On December 13 2017 the Court heard oral argument on the motion On March 28 2018 the Court denied defendants motion to dismiss Defendants filed a request for interlocutory appeal and the Delaware Supreme

judgment on November 4 2019 On January 22 2020 all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount that would be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy The settlement which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party was approved by the Court on August 17 2020 Tesla received payment of approximately 43 million on September 16 2020 which has been recognized in our consolidated statement of operations as a reduction to selling general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred in the securities litigation related to the acquisition of SolarCity On February 4 2020 the Court issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs previouslyfiled motion and granted in part and denied in part defendants previouslyfiled motion Fact and expert discovery is complete and the case was set for trial in March 2020 until it was postponed by the Court due to safety precautions concerning COVID19 The current tentative dates for the trial are from July 12 to July 23 2021 subject to change based on any further safety measures implemented by the Court These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the US District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21 2017 They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Teslas board of directors Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the abovereferenced Chancery Court litigation We believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with these claims 99 Securities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles On October 10 2017 a purported stockholder class action was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla two of its current officers and a former officer The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from

ruled in favor of defendants and dismissed the complaint with prejudice On April 8 2019 plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal and on July 17 2019 filed their opening brief We filed our opposition on September 16 2019 A hearing on the appeal before the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Ninth Circuit was held on April 30 2020 On January 26 2021 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Courts dismissal of the stockholder claims We continue to believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with this lawsuit On October 26 2018 in a similar action a purported stockholder class action was filed in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against Tesla Elon Musk and seven initial purchasers in an offering of debt securities by Tesla in August 2017 The complaint alleges misrepresentations made by Tesla regarding the number of Model 3 vehicles Tesla expected to produce by the end of 2017 in connection with such offering and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities in such offering Tesla thereafter removed the case to federal court On January 22 2019 plaintiff abandoned its effort to proceed in state court instead filing an amended complaint against Tesla Elon Musk and seven initial purchasers in the debt offering before the same judge in the US District Court for the Northern District of California who is hearing the abovereferenced earlier filed federal case On February 5 2019 the Court stayed this new case pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss the complaint in such earlier filed federal case After such earlier filed federal case was dismissed defendants filed a motion on July 2 2019 to dismiss this case as well This case is now stayed pending a ruling from the Ninth Circuit on the earlier filed federal case with an agreement that if defendants prevail on appeal in such case this case will be dismissed We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with this lawsuit Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award On June 4 2018 a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the members of Teslas board of directors as then constituted alleging corporate waste unjust enrichment and that such

compensation plan On August 31 2018 defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1 2018 and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13 2018 The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9 2019 On September 20 2019 the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims Our answer was filed on December 3 2019 and trial is set for April 2022 Fact discovery is ongoing We believe the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with this lawsuit Litigation Related to Directors Compensation On June 17 2020 a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery purportedly on behalf of Tesla against certain of Teslas current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Teslas directors other than Elon Musk between 2017 and 2020 The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief unspecified damages and other relief Defendants filed their answer on September 17 2020 Trial is set for September 2022 and fact discovery is ongoing We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with this lawsuit 100 Securities Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction Between August 10 2018 and September 6 2018 nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr Musks August 7 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private All of the suits are now pending in the US District Court for the Northern District of California Although the complaints vary in certain respects they each purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to Mr Musks statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Teslas securities Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint on January 16 2019 and added as defendants the members of Teslas board of directors The nowconsolidated purported stockholder class action was stayed while the issue of selection of lead counsel was briefed and argued before the Ninth Circuit The Ninth Circuit ruled regarding lead counsel Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on November 22 2019 The hearing on the motion was held on March 6 2020 On April 15 2020 the Court denied defendants motion to dismiss The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders which the court granted on November 25 2020 Trial is set for May 2022 We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously We are unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss associated with these claims Between October 17 2018 and November 9 2018 five derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr Musk and the members of Teslas board of directors as then constituted in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going private transaction In addition to these cases on October 25 2018 another derivative lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the District of Delaware against Mr Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted The Courts in both the Delaware federal court and Delaware Court of Chancery actions have consolidated their respective actions and stayed each consolidated action pending resolution of the abovereferenced consolidated purported stockholder class action We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously We are unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss if any associated with these lawsuits Beginning on March 7 2019 various stockholders filed derivative suits in the Delaware Court of Chancery purportedly on behalf of Tesla naming Mr Musk and Teslas board of directors as then constituted also related to Mr Musks August 7 2018 Twitter post that is the basis of the abovereferenced consolidated purported stockholder class action as well as to Mr Musks February 19 2019 Twitter post regarding Teslas vehicle production The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief unspecified damages and other relief Plaintiffs agreed to a stipulation that these derivative cases would be stayed pending the outcome of the abovereferenced consolidated purported stockholder class action In March 2019 plaintiffs in one of these derivative suits moved to lift the stay and for an expedited trial Briefs were filed on March 13 2019 and the hearing was held on March 18 2019 Defendants prevailed with the Court denying the plaintiffs request for an expedited trial and granting defendants request to continue to stay this suit pending the outcome of the abovereferenced consolidated purported stockholder class action On May 4 2020 the same plaintiffs again filed a motion requesting to lift the stay and for an expedited trial Briefs were filed on May 13 2020 and May 15 2020 and a hearing was held on May 19 2020 Defendants again prevailed with the Court denying plaintiffs request to lift the stay and for an expedited trial The plaintiffs also sought leave to file an amended complaint which was granted The Court entered an order implementing its ruling on May 21 2020 The amended complaint asserts additional allegations of breach of fiduciary duty related to two additional Twitter posts by Mr Musk dated July 29 2019 and May 1 2020 and seeks unspecified damages and declaratory and injunctive relief We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously We are unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss if any associated with these lawsuits Certain Investigations and Other Matters We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the National Transportation Safety Board the SEC the Department of Justice DOJ and various state federal and international agencies We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests In particular the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with a Elon Musks prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private and b certain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and other public statements relating to Model 3 production The takeprivate investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment On December 4 2019 the SEC i closed the investigation into the projections and other public statements regarding Model 3 production rates and ii issued a subpoena seeking information concerning certain financial data and contracts including Teslas regular financing arrangements Separately the DOJ had also asked us to voluntarily provide it with information about the above matters related to taking Tesla private and Model 3 production rates Aside from the settlement as amended with the SEC relating to Mr Musks statement that he was considering taking Tesla private there have not been any developments in these matters that we deem to be material and to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred As is our normal practice we have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with government authorities We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business results of operation prospects cash flows and financial position 101 We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business results of operations prospects cash flows financial position and brand Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from reductions in investment tax credits claimed under US federal laws for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a cosited solar power facility ITCs Generally such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy systems as assessed by the US Internal Revenue Service the IRS for purposes of claiming ITCs For each balance sheet date we assess and recognize when applicable a distribution payable for the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information available at that time including any audits undertaken by the IRS We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us for this obligation are not probable or material based on the facts known at the filing date The maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the solar energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the values that the IRS would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs We claim ITCs based on guidelines provided by the US Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the IRS We use fair values determined with the assistance of independent thirdparty appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs that are passedthrough to and claimed by the fund investors Since we cannot determine exactly how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs we are unable to reliably estimate the maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this obligation as of each balance sheet date We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation The amount of incentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size andor the amount of solar energy produced We also currently participate in one states incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service State and local incentives received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund We are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received Letters of Credit As of December 31 2020 we had 233 million of unused letters of credit outstanding Note 17 Variable Interest Entity Arrangements We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles In particular our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810 Consolidation We have considered the provisions within the agreements which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs including determining the solar energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs redeploying solar energy systems or vehicles and managing customer receivables We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund net of agreed upon expenses estimated expenses tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements Generally our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investors interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements Pursuant to management services maintenance and warranty arrangements we have been contracted to provide services to the funds such as operations and maintenance support accounting lease servicing and performance reporting In some instances we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements A funds creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds None of the assets of the funds had been pledged as collateral for their obligations 102 The aggregate carrying values of the VIEs assets and liabilities after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows in millions December 31 December 31 2020 2019 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 87 106 Accounts receivable net 28 27 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 105 100 Total current assets 220 233 Operating lease vehicles net 1183 Solar energy systems net 4749 5030 Other noncurrent assets 182 156 Total assets 5151 6602 Liabilities Current liabilities Accrued liabilities and other 63 80 Deferred revenue 11 78 Customer deposits 14 9 Current portion of debt and finance leases 797 608 Total current liabilities 885 775 Deferred revenue net of current portion 168 264 Debt and finance leases net of current portion 1346 1516 Other longterm liabilities 19 22 Total liabilities 2418 2577 Note 18 Lease PassThrough Financing Obligation Through December 31 2020 we had entered into eight transactions referred to as lease passthrough fund arrangements Under these arrangements our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors through arrangements contractually structured as master leases for an initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years These solar energy systems are subject to lease or PPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25 years These solar energy systems are included within solar energy systems net on the consolidated balance sheets The cost of the solar energy systems under lease passthrough fund arrangements as of December 31 2020 and 2019 was 105 billion The accumulated depreciation on these assets as of December 31 2020 and 2019 was 137 million and 101 million respectively The total lease passthrough financing obligation as of December 31 2020 was 68 million of which 41 million is classified as a current liability The total lease passthrough financing obligation as of December 31 2019 was 94 million of which 57 million was classified as a current liability Lease passthrough financing obligation is included in accrued liabilities and other for the current portion and other longterm liabilities for the longterm portion on the consolidated balance sheets Under a lease passthrough fund arrangement the investor makes a large upfront payment to the lessor which is one of our subsidiaries and in some cases subsequent periodic payments We allocate a portion of the aggregate investor payments to the fair value of the assigned ITCs which is estimated by discounting the projected cash flow impact of the ITCs using a market interest rate and is accounted for separately We account for the remainder of the investor payments as a borrowing by recording the proceeds received as a lease passthrough financing obligation which is repaid from the future customer lease payments and any incentive rebates A portion of the amounts received by the investor is allocated to interest expense using the effective interest rate method The lease passthrough financing obligation is nonrecourse once the associated solar energy systems have been placed inservice and the associated customer arrangements have been assigned to the investors In addition we are responsible for any warranties performance guarantees accounting and performance reporting Furthermore we continue to account for the customer arrangements and any incentive rebates in the consolidated financial statements regardless of whether the cash is received by us or directly by the investors 103 As of December 31 2020 the future minimum master lease payments to be received from investors for each of the next five years and thereafter were as follows in millions 2021 41 2022 33 2023 26 2024 18 2025 27 Thereafter 423 Total 568 For two of the lease passthrough fund arrangements our subsidiaries have pledged its assets to the investors as security for its obligations under the contractual agreements Each lease passthrough fund arrangement has a onetime master lease prepayment adjustment mechanism that occurs when the capacity and the placedinservice dates of the associated solar energy systems are finalized or on an agreedupon date As part of this mechanism the master lease prepayment amount is updated and we may be obligated to refund a portion of a master lease prepayment or entitled to receive an additional master lease prepayment Any additional master lease prepayments are recorded as an additional lease passthrough financing obligation while any master lease prepayment refunds would reduce the lease passthrough financing obligation Note 19 Defined Contribution Plan We have a 401k savings plan that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code Under the 401k savings plan participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100 of their eligible compensation subject to certain limitations Participants are fully vested in their contributions We did no t make any contributions to the 401k savings plan during the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 other than employee deferrals of eligible compensation Note 20 Related Party Transactions In November 2018 our CEO purchased from us 284575 shares of our common stock in a private placement at a per share price equal to the last closing price of our stock prior to the execution of the purchase agreement for an aggregate 20 million as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split In May 2019 our CEO purchased from us 514400 shares of our common stock in a public offering at the public offering price for an aggregate 25 million as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split In February 2020 our CEO and a member of our Board of Directors purchased from us 65185 and 6250 shares respectively of our common stock in a public offering at the public offering price for an aggregate 10 million and 1 million respectively as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split In June 2020 our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us for an interim term of 90 days During the interim term we resumed our annual evaluation of all available options for providing directors and officers indemnity coverage which we had suspended during the height of shelterinplace requirements related to the COVID19 pandemic As part of such process we obtained a binding market quote for a directors and officers liability insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit of 100 million Pursuant to the indemnification agreement our CEO provided from his personal funds directors and officers indemnity coverage to us during the interim term in the event such coverage is not indemnifiable by us up to a total of 100 million In return we paid our CEO a total of 3 million which represents the marketbased premium for the market quote described above as prorated for 90 days and further discounted by 50 Following the lapse of the 90day period we did not extend the term of the indemnification agreement with our CEO and instead bound a customary directors and officers liability insurance policy with thirdparty carriers 104 Note 2 1 Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas We have two operating and reportable segments i automotive and ii energy
