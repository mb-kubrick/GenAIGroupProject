foregoing information regarding our website and its content is for convenience only and not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Report nor filed with the SEC 1 Item 1 Business Continued OVERVIEW Below is a description of our reportable segments and other activities AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT The Automotive segment primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles service parts and accessories worldwide together with the associated costs to develop manufacture distribute and service the vehicles parts and accessories This segment includes revenues and costs related to our electrification vehicle programs The segment includes the following regional business units North America South America Europe China including Taiwan and the International Markets Group General Our vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln In 2021 we sold approximately 3942000 vehicles at wholesale throughout the world See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 for a discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volumes Substantially all of our vehicles parts and accessories are sold through distributors and dealers collectively dealerships the substantial majority of which are independently owned At December 31 the approximate number of dealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands was as follows Brand 2020 2021 Ford 9618 8900 FordLincoln combined 707 654 Lincoln 392 401 Total 10717 9955 We do not depend on any single customer or a few customers to the extent that the loss of such customers would have a material adverse effect on our business In addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale we also sell vehicles to our dealerships for sale to fleet customers including commercial fleet customers daily rental car companies and governments We also sell parts and accessories primarily to our dealerships which in turn sell these products to retail customers and to authorized parts distributors which in turn primarily sell these products to retailers We also offer extended service contracts The worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic and political conditions over which we have little control Vehicles are durable goods and consumers and businesses have latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing vehicle The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth geopolitical events and other factors including the cost of purchasing and operating cars trucks and utility vehicles and the availability and cost of financing and fuel As a result the number of cars trucks and utility vehicles sold may vary substantially from year to year Further the automotive industry is a highly competitive business that has a wide and growing variety of product and service offerings from a growing number of manufacturers 2 Item 1 Business Continued Our wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand Our wholesale unit volumes also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory and our ability to maintain sufficient production levels to support desired dealer inventory in the event of supplier disruptions or other types of disruptions affecting our production Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived by customers in comparison to those offered by other manufacturers based on many factors including price quality styling reliability safety fuel efficiency functionality and reputation Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions Our ability to satisfy changing consumer and business preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle as well as design and performance characteristics affects our sales and earnings significantly As with other manufacturers the profitability of our business is affected by many factors including Wholesale unit volumes Margin of profit on each vehicle sold which in turn is affected by many factors such as Market factors volume and mix of vehicles and options sold and net pricing reflecting among other factors incentive programs Costs of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles Costs for customer warranty claims and additional service actions Costs for safety emissions and fuel economy technology and equipment A high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can significantly affect overall profitability Our industry has a very competitive pricing environment driven in part by industry excess capacity For the past several decades manufacturers typically have given price discounts and other marketing incentives to provide value for customers and maintain market share and production levels The decline in value of foreign currencies in the past has contributed significantly to competitive pressures in many of our markets The US administration has sought to address this issue with currency provisions that were included in the United StatesMexicoCanada Agreement and United StatesChina trade deals Competitive Position The worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers with no single dominant producer Certain manufacturers however account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries especially their countries of origin Seasonality We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors including retail sales ie units sold by our dealerships to their customers at retail and dealer stock levels ie the number of units held in inventory by our dealerships for sale to their customers Historically we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in the business with production in many markets tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer typically the strongest sales months of the year Because of constraints related to COVID19 in 2020 and more recently due to the semiconductor shortage production has been higher in the second half of the year Backlog Orders During the past year gross stock levels at dealers were lower than normal due largely to the semiconductor shortage and the amount of time required to fill orders for certain vehicles increased Raw Materials We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in the production of and development of technologies in our vehicles These materials include base metals eg steel and aluminum precious metals eg palladium energy eg natural gas and plasticsresins eg polypropylene As we transition to a greater mix of battery electric vehicles we expect to increase our reliance on lithium cobalt and nickel for batteries We believe we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs however there always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact availability in sufficient quantities and at cost effective prices to meet our needs See the Key Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry section of Item 7 for a discussion of supplier disruptions caused by a shortage of key components as well as commodity and energy price changes and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Item 7A for a discussion of commodity price risks Intellectual Property We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents trade secrets copyrights and trademarks on a global basis We expect to continue building this portfolio as we actively pursue innovation in every part of our business We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our Company and its products and services globally While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property agreement 3 Item 1 Business Continued Warranty Coverage Field Service Actions and Customer Satisfaction Actions We provide warranties on vehicles we sell Warranties are offered for specific periods of time andor mileage and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale Pursuant to these warranties we will repair replace or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factorysupplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period In addition to the costs associated with this warranty coverage provided on our vehicles we also incur costs as a result of field service actions ie safety recalls emission recalls and other product campaigns and for customer satisfaction actions For additional information regarding warranty and related costs see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 and Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements Wholesales Wholesales consist primarily of vehicles sold to dealerships For the majority of such sales we recognize revenue when we ship the vehicles to our dealerships from our manufacturing facilities See Item 7 for additional discussion of revenue recognition practices Wholesales in each

previously included in the Mobility segment to the Automotive segment Accordingly the Mobility segment primarily includes development costs for Fords autonomous vehicles and related businesses Fords equity ownership in Argo AI a developer of autonomous driving systems and other mobility businesses and investments FORD CREDIT SEGMENT The Ford Credit segment is comprised of the Ford Credit business on a consolidated basis which is primarily vehiclerelated financing and leasing activities Ford Credit offers a wide variety of automotive financing products to and through automotive dealers throughout the world The predominant share of Ford Credits business consists of financing our vehicles and supporting our dealers Ford Credit earns its revenue primarily from payments made under retail installment sale and finance lease retail financing and operating lease contracts that it originates and purchases interest rate supplements and other support payments from us and our affiliates and payments made under dealer financing programs As a result of these financing activities Ford Credit has a large portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases which it classifies into two portfoliosconsumer and nonconsumer Finance receivables and operating leases in the consumer portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of our vehicles from dealers for personal and commercial use Retail financing includes retail installment sale contracts for new and used vehicles and finance leases comprised of salestype and direct financing leases for new vehicles to retail and commercial customers including leasing companies government entities daily rental companies and fleet customers Finance receivables in the nonconsumer portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers Ford Credit makes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory also known as floorplan financing as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities finance the purchase of dealership real estate and finance other dealer vehicle programs Ford Credit also purchases receivables generated by us and our affiliates primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet companies Ford Credit also provides financing to us for vehicles that we lease to our employees Ford Credit does business in the United States and Canada through business centers Outside of the United States Europe is Ford Credits largest operation Ford Credits European operations are managed primarily through its United Kingdombased subsidiary FCE Bank plc FCE Within Europe Ford Credits largest markets are the United Kingdom and Germany See Item 7 and Notes 10 and 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of Ford Credits receivables credit losses allowance for credit losses losstoreceivables ratios funding sources and funding strategies See Item 7A for a discussion of how Ford Credit manages its financial market risks We routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealers customer These programs increase Ford Credits financing volume and share See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information about our accounting for these programs We have a Second Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement with Ford Credit pursuant to which if Ford Credits managed leverage for a calendar quarter were to be higher than 1151 as reported in its most recent periodic report Ford Credit could require us to make or cause to be made a capital contribution to it in an amount sufficient to have caused such managed leverage to have been 1151 No capital contributions have been made pursuant to this agreement In a separate agreement with FCE Ford Credit has agreed to maintain FCEs net worth in excess of 500 million No payments have been made pursuant to that agreement Ford Credit files periodic reports with the SEC that contain additional information regarding Ford Credit The reports are available through Ford Credits website located at wwwfordcreditcominvestorcenter and can also be found on the SECs website located at

included in our Automotive segment and gains and losses from our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise that are not allocated to operating segments These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy providing oversight and stewardship and promoting the Companys interests Effective January 1 2021 i cash and other centrally managed corporate assets reported in the Automotive segment were realigned to Corporate Other and ii certain corporate governance expenses that benefit the global enterprise previously reported in the Automotive segment are reported as part of Corporate Other INTEREST ON DEBT Interest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit GOVERNMENTAL STANDARDS Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety fuel economy emissions control noise control vehicle recycling substances of concern vehicle damage and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles engines and equipment In addition manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions water discharges and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances The most significant of the standards and regulations affecting us are discussed below Vehicle Emissions Control US Requirements Federal and California Tailpipe Emission Standards Both the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the California Air Resources Board CARB have established motor vehicle tailpipe and evaporative emissions standards that become increasingly stringent over time Fifteen states have adopted Californias lightduty standards other states may join them and states may also adopt Californias heavyduty standards Both federal and California regulations also require motor vehicles to be equipped with onboard diagnostic OBD systems that monitor emissionrelated systems and components In addition light and mediumduty vehicles and heavyduty engines must be certified by EPA prior to sale in the United States and by CARB prior to sale in California and the relevant states Canada accepts EPA certification Compliance with emissions standards OBD requirements and related regulations can be challenging and can drive increased product development costs warranty costs and vehicle recalls CARB has adopted new emissions regulations applicable to model year 2024 heavyduty engines as well as extended heavyduty warranty requirements for the 2022 model year and EPA has announced that it intends to adopt more stringent heavyduty standards beginning with the 2027 model year These rules include more stringent emissions standards as well as new requirements affecting durability testing warranty and OBD CARB has also proposed new lightduty emissions standards applicable to 2026 model year vehicles that include a more stringent fleetaverage emissions standard and other new emissions requirements These new rules are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on the development of lightduty vehicles and heavyduty engines Compliance with automobile emissions standards depends in part on the widespread availability of highquality and consistent automotive fuels that the vehicles were designed to use Legislative regulatory and judicial developments related to fuel quality at both the national and state levels could affect vehicle manufacturers warranty costs as well as their ability to comply with vehicle emissions standards 7 Item 1 Business Continued The California vehicle emissions program also includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale zeroemission vehicles ZEVs The current lightduty vehicle ZEV regulation which uses a system based on credits that can be banked and carried forward mandates substantial annual increases in the production and sale of batteryelectric fuel cell and plugin hybrid vehicles through the 2025 model year At that time the regulation will require credits equating to 22 of a manufacturers California lightduty vehicle sales volume California is in the process of adopting new ZEV regulations applicable to model years 20262035 The proposed regulations include substantial annual increases in required sales volumes significant restrictions on credit usage and new requirements for EV battery durability California has also instituted ZEV regulations aimed at medium and heavyduty vehicles beginning with the 2024 model year These medium and heavyduty rules which could entail significant costs and compliance challenges include complex warranty and recall requirements for some vehicle configurations Compliance with ZEV rules depends on market conditions as well as the availability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging European Requirements European Union EU and UK regulations directives and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the EU and the United Kingdom Regulatory stringency has increased significantly since Stage VI emission standards were introduced with the subsequent implementation of a laboratory test cycle for CO and emissions and the introduction of onroad emission testing using portable emission analyzers Real Driving Emission or RDE These onroad emission tests are in addition to the laboratorybased tests The divergence between the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory conditions and the allowed values measured in RDE tests will ultimately be reduced to zero as the regulatory demands increase In addition new requirements for tailpipe and nontailpipe emissions will be included in the upcoming Euro 7 regulation The costs associated with complying with all of these requirements are significant and following the EU Commissions indication of its intent to accelerate emissions rules in its road map publication EU Green Deal as well as the EU sustainable mobility action plan these challenges will continue in European markets including the United Kingdom In addition the Whole Vehicle Type Approval WVTA regulation has been updated to increase the stringency of inmarket surveillance Moreover following the UKs withdrawal from the European Union we may be subject to diverging requirements in our European markets which could increase vehicle complexity and duties There is an increasing trend of city access restrictions for internal combustion engine powered vehicles particularly in European cities that do not meet air quality limits The access rules being introduced are developed by individual cities based on their specific concerns resulting in rapid deployment of access rules that differ greatly among cities The speed of implementation of access rules may directly influence customer vehicle residual values and choice of next purchase and there is a risk that these rules may result in the need for customers to retrofit their vehicles with emission aftertreatment systems In an effort to support the Paris Accord some countries are adopting yearly increases in CO taxes where such a system is in place and publishing dates by when internal combustion powered vehicles may no longer be registered eg Norway in 2025 and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in 2030 Other National Requirements Many countries in an effort to address air quality and climate change concerns are adopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe UNECE mobile source emission regulations Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of European or US regulations For example the China Stage VI light duty vehicle emission standards based on European Stage VI emission standards for light duty vehicles US evaporative and refueling emissions standards and CARB OBD II requirements incorporate two levels of stringency for tailpipe emissions Under the level one VIa standard which is currently in place nationwide in China the emissions limits are comparable to the EU Stage VI limits except for CO which is 30 lower than the EU Stage VI limit The more stringent level two VIb standards emissions limits are approximately 3050 lower than the EU Stage VI limits depending on the pollutant While level two VIb is not slated for nationwide implementation until July 2023 the government has encouraged the more economically developed cities and provinces to pull ahead implementation For example Shanghai Tianjin Hebei province and Guangdong province have all begun implementing level two VIb Both China Stage VII light duty vehicle and heavy duty vehicle emission regulations are currently under evaluation and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has advised that the Stage VII regulations will have more stringent limits on pollutant emissions and will establish limits for greenhouse gas primarily CO tailpipe emissions Canadian criteria emissions regulations are largely aligned with US requirements however the existing ZEV regulations in Quebec and those published in British Columbia in July 2020 are more stringent than those in place in California The federal government has started preliminary consultations on a potential ZEV mandate Elsewhere there is a mix of regulations and processes based on US and EU standards Not all countries have adopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emission standards adopted This could lead to compliance problems particularly if OBD or inuse surveillance requirements are implemented 8 Item 1 Business Continued Global Developments In recent years EPA and CARB have increased their focus on the use of defeat devices Defeat devices are elements of design typically embedded in software that improperly cause the emission control system to function less effectively during normal onroad driving than during an official laboratory emissions test without justification They are prohibited by law in many jurisdictions and we do not use defeat devices in our vehicles Regulators around the world continue to scrutinize automakers emission testing which has led to a number of defeat device settlements by various manufacturers EPA is carrying out additional nonstandard tests as part of its vehicle certification program CARB has also been conducting extensive nonstandard emission tests which in some cases have resulted in certification delays for diesel vehicles In the past several European countries have conducted nonstandard emission tests and published the results and in some cases this supplemental testing has triggered investigations of manufacturers for possible defeat devices Testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis In addition plaintiffs attorneys are pursuing consumer class action lawsuits based on alleged excessive emissions from cars and trucks which could in turn prompt further investigations by regulators Vehicle Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Standards US Requirements LightDuty Vehicles Federal law requires that light duty vehicles meet minimum corporate average fuel economy CAFE standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA Manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the CAFE standard in any model year after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years The law requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each manufacturers fleet of domestic passenger cars imported passenger cars and lightduty trucks EPA also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act Because the vast majority of GHGs emitted by a vehicle are the result of fuel combustion GHG emission standards are similar to fuel economy standards Thus NHTSA and EPA coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and GHG standards respectively to avoid potential inconsistencies Beginning with the 2012 model year EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated harmonized GHG and fuel economy regulations under what came to be known as the One National Program ONP framework California which had promulgated its own statespecific set of GHG regulations agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with its own GHG requirements thereby avoiding a patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state GHG standards ONP has required manufacturers to achieve increasingly stringent yearoveryear standards ONP was envisioned to continue at least through the 2025 model year In 2020 EPA introduced significantly less stringent fuel economy and GHG standards applicable to model years 20212026 The federal government also revoked Californias authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards as well as the authority of other states that opted in to Californias standards California continued to assert its authority to regulate vehicle GHGs challenged in court the federal governments preemption actions withdrew from ONP and planned to return to enforcing its own statespecific GHG standards The litigation over both standards and preemption with uncertain outcomes created difficulty for purposes of Fords future product planning To avoid a bifurcated regulatory scenario in which California and the 15 other states that adopted Californias GHG standards enforce one set of rules while a different set of rules applies in the rest of the country Ford reached an agreement with California on a set of terms for an alternative framework in which Ford committed to meet a designated set of standards on a national basis in lieu of the California regulatory program This framework enabled Ford to continue its product planning on a nationwide basis while being consistent with Fords environmental goals Ford finalized its agreement with California in 2020 and other states that adopted the California standards indicated they would respect the agreement 9 Item 1 Business Continued In 2021 EPA again reevaluated the stringency of fuel economy and GHG standards through the 2026 model year and whether to restore the stringency to the previous ONP levels or greater Final GHG standards applicable to model years 20232026 were finalized in December 2021 with increased stringency These standards along with more stringent fuel economy standards for model years 20242026 that are expected to be finalized in 2022 could increase costs and complexity for Ford The federal government also acted in December 2021 to repeal its rule blocking Californias authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards as well as the authority of other states that adopted Californias standards EPA is expected to take similar action in early 2022 under the Clean Air Act If any federal or state agency imposes and enforces fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market conditions Ford would likely be forced to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on its sales volumes and results of operations Such actions likely would include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options increasing market support programs for Fords most fuelefficient vehicles and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicles such as highperformance cars utilities andor fullsize light trucks in order to maintain compliance US Requirements HeavyDuty Vehicles EPA and NHTSA have jointly promulgated GHG and fuel economy standards for heavyduty vehicles generally vehicles over 8500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating through the 2027 model year In Fords case the standards primarily affect heavyduty pickup trucks and vans plus vocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks As the heavyduty standards increase in stringency it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavyduty trucks European Requirements The European Union regulates passenger car and light commercial vehicle CO emissions using sliding scales with different CO targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for its fleet of vehicles first registered in a calendar year with separate targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles A penalty system applies to manufacturers failing to meet the individual CO targets Pooling agreements between manufacturers to utilize credits are possible under certain conditions and we have entered into such pooling agreements in order to comply with fuel economy regulations without paying a penalty and to enable other manufacturers to benefit from our positive CO performance For multistage vehicles eg Fords Transit chassis cabs the base manufacturer eg Ford is fully responsible for the CO performance of the final upfitted vehicles The initial target levels get significantly more stringent every five years 2025 2030 2035 requiring significant investments in propulsion technologies and extensive fleet management forcing low CO emissions Delayed launches supply shortages or lower demand for low CO emission vehicles as well as a limited charging infrastructure can trigger compliance risks The EU Commission is investigating the introduction of Real Driving CO and Life Cycle Assessment elements and heavyduty vehicles are addressed in separate regulations with analogous requirements and challenges As discussed above the EU Commission has announced a Green Deal that is likely to trigger more stringent requirements for CO emissions including stricter CO fleet regulations and other regulated emissions and include recycling and substance restrictions While the EU Commission targets net climate neutrality by 2050 and a more ambitious 2030 interim target a 55 instead of 40 CO reduction compared to 1990 several countries such as Germany have adopted stricter interim targets and earlier net climate neutrality targets Outside of the EU the United Kingdom and Switzerland have introduced similar rules Ford faces the risk of advance premium payment requirements for both passenger cars as well as for light commercial vehicles due to for example unexpected market fluctuations and shorter lead times impacting average fleet performance The United Nations developed a technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO This world light duty test procedure WLTP is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory CO and fuel consumption figures with customerreported figures The introduction of WLTP in Europe started in September 2017 and requires updates to CO labeling thereby impacting taxes in countries with a CO tax scheme as well as CO fleet regulations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP are significant Some European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO vehicle emissions including fiscal measures and CO labeling to address country specific targets associated with the Paris Accord For example the United Kingdom France Germany Spain Portugal and the Netherlands among others have introduced taxation based on CO emissions The EU CO requirements are likely to trigger further measures 10 Item 1 Business Continued Other National Requirements The Canadian federal government regulates vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act In October 2014 the Canadian federal government published the final changes to the regulation for lightduty vehicles which maintain alignment with US EPA vehicle GHG standards for the 20172025 model years The revised US EPA standards were automatically adopted in Canada by reference for the 20222025 model years however Canada also undertook a midterm evaluation of the standards for the 2022 model year and beyond which concluded in 2021 and sought to align with the most stringent standards in the United States federal or state When US EPAs final rule goes into effect Canada will automatically adopt the new standards by reference to the US Code of Federal Regulations However consultation is now underway for the few standalone elements that are not automatically adopted by reference for the 20232025 model years and these draft amendments are expected in 2022 The heavyduty vehicle and engine GHG emissions regulations for the 2021 model year and beyond were published in May 2018 and are in line with US requirements subject to any change in those requirements under the current US presidential administration Chinas Corporate Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle NEV Credit Administrative Rules contain fuel consumption requirements as well as credit mandates for NEV passenger vehicles ie plugin hybrids battery electric vehicles or fuel cell vehicles The fuel consumption requirement uses a weightbased approach to establish targets with yearoveryear target reductions China set a target of 50L100km for the 2020 passenger vehicle industry fuel consumption fleet average which lowers to 40L100km by 2025 based on the New European Driving Cycle NEDC system The government is projecting a further fuel consumption reduction in 2030 and is targeting 32L100km The NEV mandate requires that OEMs generate a specific amount of NEV credits each year with NEV credits of at least 14 16 and 18 of the annual ICE passenger vehicle production or import volume required in 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively Future percentages are currently under consideration As discussed below in Item 1A Risk Factors under Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with safety emissions fuel economy autonomous vehicle and other regulations a production disruption stop ship lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product plans or in some cases purchase credits in order to comply with fuel economy standards Vehicle Safety US Requirements The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 the Safety Act regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in two primary ways First the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly and has continued to evolve as global compliance and public domain eg New Car Assessment Programs NCAPs Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHS requirements continue to evolve are increasing in demands and lack harmonization globally As we expand our business priorities to include autonomous vehicles and broader mobility products and services our financial exposure has increased Second the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial European Requirements The EU has established vehicle safety standards and regulations and is likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirements in the future especially in the areas of access to invehicle data and autonomous vehicles The European General Safety Regulation GSR introduced UNECE regulations which will be required for the European Type Approval process The GSR includes the mandatory introduction of multiple active and passive safety features including cybersecurity requirements for new vehicle models in 2022 and for all registrations in 2024 EU regulators also are focusing on active safety features such as lane departure warning systems electronic stability control and automatic brake assist Other National Requirements Globally governments generally have been adopting UNECE based regulations with minor variations to address local concerns Any difference between North American and UNECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to the development of global platform vehicles and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing a common level of safety performance several ongoing bilateral negotiations on free trade can potentially contribute to this goal 11 Item 1 Business Continued Safety and recall requirements in Brazil China India and Gulf Cooperation Council GCC countries may add substantial costs and complexity to our global recall practice Brazil has set mandatory fleet safety targets and penalties are applied if these levels are not maintained while a tax reduction may be available for overperformance In Canada regulatory requirements are currently aligned with US regulations however under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or noncompliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety In 2021 Canada started preliminary consultations on several new proposed regulations including an Administrative Monetary Penalties AMPs Regulation Draft language for the AMPs regulation is expected in 2022 In China a new mandatory Event Data Recorder regulation that is more comprehensive than US requirements has been released and in China Malaysia and South Korea mandatory eCall requirements are being drafted ECall is mandatory in the UAE for new vehicles beginning with the 2021 model year and is expected to become mandatory in a number of other GCC countries within five years New Car Assessment Programs Organizations around the world rate and compare motor vehicles in NCAPs to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations and use stars to rate vehicle safety with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest Achieving high NCAP ratings which may vary by country or region can add complexity and cost to vehicles Similarly environmental rating systems exist in various regions eg Green NCAP in Europe In China CNCAP has a stringent rating structure to decrease the number of fivestar ratings Further the China Insurance Auto Safety Index similar to IIHS has been implemented with higher standards for passenger and pedestrian protection and driver assistance technologies These protocols impose additional requirements relating to testing evaluation and mandatory safety features and compliance with them or any subsequent updates to them may be costly 12 Item 1 Business Continued HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES People Strategy and Governance Caring for each other through valuing diversity embracing inclusion celebrating success encouraging new thinking supporting each other through change and winning as a team is a key element of our plan to drive longterm business success Ford maintains an Executive People Forum consisting of the CEO and top leadership team that meets monthly with a specific focus on people and organizational topics that will enable and accelerate delivery of the business plan Key topic areas include our Enterprise People Strategy Organization Design Workforce Planning Talent Planning Development and Leadership Development Culture Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters including items discussed at the Executive People Forum The Compensation Talent and Culture Committee maintains responsibility to review discuss and set strategic direction for various peoplerelated business strategies including compensation and benefit programs leadership succession planning culture diversity equity and inclusion DEI and talent development programs The Sustainability Innovation and Policy Committee is responsible for discussing and advising management on maintaining and improving sustainability strategies the implementation of which creates value consistent with the longterm preservation and enhancement of shareholder value and social wellbeing including human rights working conditions and responsible sourcing The collective recommendations to the Board and its committees are how we proactively manage our human capital and care for our employees in a manner that is consistent with our Ford values Diversity Equity and Inclusion At Ford we believe that creating a Culture of Belonging for all our employees is both foundational to achieving our Ford plan and the right thing to do Ford offers 11 Employee Resource Groups ERGs that represent various dimensions of our employee population including racial ethnic gender religious sexual orientation and gender identity ability and generational communities with chapters throughout the world in addition to Ford Advocacy for Belonging FAB Councils in every region Our ERGs and FAB Councils are instrumental in providing a voice to our globally diverse workforce as well as sharing valuable insights into the development of products services and experiences In 2020 and 2021 we conducted comprehensive DEI Audits in the United States and seven major markets The purpose of the audits which included qualitative data quantitative data and deep ethnography is to accelerate our efforts to improve the employee experience and cultivate a culture of belonging Each of our global Business Units has developed action plans specific to its unique needs and culture From an enterprise perspective we have taken several concrete steps to further these efforts including embedding DEI into our corporate strategy and governance and establishing objectives for progress for every salaried employee This holistic DEI strategy includes a strong focus on racial equity and DEI education Our diversity statistics include the following as of December 31 2021 based on selfreporting at the date of hire 281 of our salaried employees worldwide are females excludes certain employees in Europe in accordance with the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation 250 of our total salaried and hourly employees in the United States are females and 349 of our total salaried and hourly employees in the United States are minorities Talent Attraction Growth and Capability Assessment In an environment where many employees are no longer bound to physical locations where and how we source our talent is evolving From a growth perspective we are focusing on several key segments vital to our success eg software electrification and data science Since January 2020 we have added a substantial number of employees to our salaried workforce to support these emerging areas of our business and have dedicated more resources to recruiting these employees 13 Item 1 Business Continued From a capability perspective we are leveraging best practices in assessments and talent management to strengthen our current capabilities and future pipeline while reinforcing a culture of belonging empowerment and innovation Further we are also creating targeted learning experiences democratizing learning and career development opportunities across the organization and empowering employees to design their own career paths with skill development targeted for the roles of today and the future Finally the extent to which our People Leaders are equipped to care for inspire and empower our people plays a vital role in our strategy and we are committed to helping our leaders strengthen these capabilities with dedicated learning paths and nontraditional learning opportunities In 2021 we established Leadership a new mechanism for developing People Leaders and delivering key messages related to that role including demonstrating care fostering psychological safety instilling a challenger mindset and leading through the evolution of work Through Leadership we have activated People Leaders quickly and at scale to help deliver Ford Employee Health and Safety Nothing is more important than the health safety and wellbeing of our people and we consistently strive to achieve worldclass levels of safety through the application of sound policies and best practices We maintain a robust safety culture to reduce workplace injuries supported by effective communication reporting and external benchmarking We verify compliance with regulatory requirements as well as our internal safety standards and regularly report to Company management on key safety issues including significant incidents and high potential nearmisses to prevent recurrences We also participate in multiindustry groups within and outside the automotive sector to share safety best practices and collaborate to address common issues Our Safety Record Any loss of life or serious injury in the workplace is unacceptable and deeply regretted Unfortunately there were three fatal incidents in 2021 in our North American manufacturing facilities Another key safety indicator is our global losttime case rate LTCR which is defined as the number of cases where one or more working days is lost due to workrelated injuryillness per 200000 hours worked Our LTCR increased to 035 in 2021 from 031 in 2020 primarily due to high variations in production schedules and employee turnover We continue to address the complexity of the global COVID19 pandemic including how we support and protect our employees the communities in which we operate and our Company assets The COVID19 Business Resumption Plan ie The ReturnToWork Playbook continues to guide our efforts to protect our employees as the pandemic continues The ReturnToWork Playbook is our corporate guideline and aligns with recommendations from the World Health Organization the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and country and local health departments The Playbooks core objective is to protect our employees and provide a safe work environment The main elements of the Playbook include Guidelines and requirements for completion of a daily health check survey Guidelines for temperature scanning prior to entering certain facilities Guidelines for appropriate use and application of Personal Protective Equipment Guidelines and recommendations for social distancing inside and outside of workstations Cleaning and disinfecting workstations and common areas Guidelines supporting handwashing methods and frequency Placement strategy for hand sanitizer stations We will continue to be vigilant and proactive in our efforts to effectively manage the COVID19 pandemic 14 Item 1 Business Continued Employee Wellbeing Initiatives Our global holistic approach to wellbeing encompasses the financial social mentalemotional physical and professional needs of our employees Foundational to our wellbeing philosophy is providing a broad array of resources and solutions to educate employees build capability and meet individual and organizational wellbeing needs and goals Wellbeing is an integral part of our total rewards strategy as we work to address business and employee challenges through a multichannel approach that provides our diverse populations and global regions flexibility and choice to meet their specific needs We use datadriven insights gathered through surveys focus groups and claims data to understand employee needs and prioritize our wellbeing efforts Through our global wellbeing programs which include enhanced childcare and parental resources Mental Health First Aid mindfulness clubs and World Mental Health Day observances among other things we provide employees with experiences selfguided tools and access to the professional support and resources they need to achieve their own sense of wellbeing We are committed to creating an environment where employees and People Leaders care for each other as we deliver Ford Employee Sentiment Strategy We leverage our asklistenobserve framework to understand employee sentiment at Ford This approach is a holistic and consistent methodology that enables us to understand how employees are feeling in real time and act accordingly Our measurement focuses on several areas that are key to our business Employee Mental and Emotional Wellbeing Health Safety including our COVID19 safety protocols Employee Experience Culture DEI Leadership and Strategic Alignment Our efforts to drive change in these areas are paying off For example we began surveying our employees about their worklife balance at the onset of the COVID19 pandemic in 2021 87 of the respondents which were primarily salaried employees indicated that they have the flexibility to balance the needs of their work and personal lives In 2021 employee responses also indicated that 84 of respondents understand corporate strategy and their role in it and 85 are excited about what Ford can accomplish in the future A critical element of our measurement program is ensuring that data ends up in the hands of those who are best positioned to drive meaningful change To this end leaders at all levels have access to dashboards with data from their teams and organizations as well as personalized next step recommendations embedded into action planning tools Our measurement approach is also used to inform our areas of focus as an organization and to evaluate the effectiveness of talent initiatives across the enterprise Employment Data The approximate number of individuals employed by us and entities that we consolidated as of December 31 was as follows in thousands 2020 a 2021 North America 100 99 South America 8 4 Europe 42 42 China including Taiwan 4 3 International Markets Group 14 16 Total Automotive 168 164 Ford Credit 6 5 Mobility 2 2 Corporate and Other 10 12 Total Company 186 183 __________ a Effective with 2021 reporting certain costs for the benefit of the global enterprise previously reported in Automotive are now reported in Corporate Other and costs and benefits related to connectivity previously reported in Mobility are now reported in Automotive Prior period totals have been updated to be consistent with 2021 reporting The reduction in employees in 2021 is primarily a result of our global redesign efforts primarily in South America and Europe partially offset by the addition of employees in growth areas including software and electrification 15 Item 1 Business Continued Substantially all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements In the United States approximately 99 of these unionized hourly employees in our Automotive segment are represented by the International Union United Automobile Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America UAW or United Auto Workers At December 31 2021 approximately 56000 hourly employees in the United States were represented by the UAW 16 ITEM 1A Risk Factors We have listed below the material risk factors applicable to us grouped into the following categories Operational Risks Macroeconomic Market and Strategic Risks Financial Risks and Legal and Regulatory Risks Operational Risks Ford and Ford Credits financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by public health issues including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID19 We face various risks related to public health issues including epidemics pandemics and other outbreaks including the global outbreak of COVID19 The impact of COVID19 including changes in consumer behavior pandemic fears and market downturns and restrictions on business and individual activities has periodically created significant volatility in the global economy There have been extraordinary actions taken by international federal state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID19 in regions throughout the world including travel bans quarantines stayathome orders and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations For example in 2020 consistent with the actions taken by governmental authorities we idled our manufacturing operations in regions around the world before ultimately resuming our manufacturing operations taking a phased approach and after introducing new safety protocols at our plants To the extent cases surge in any locations stringent limitations on daily activities that may have been eased previously could be reinstated in those areas Further if new strains or variants of COVID19 develop or sufficient amounts of vaccines or treatments are not available not widely administered for a significant period of time or otherwise prove ineffective the impact of COVID19 on the global economy and in turn our financial condition liquidity and results of operations could be material The predominant share of Ford Credits business consists of financing Ford and Lincoln vehicles and the duration or resurgence of COVID19 or similar public health issues may negatively impact the level of originations at Ford Credit For example Fords suspension of manufacturing operations a significant decline in dealer showroom traffic andor a reduction of operations at dealers may lead to a significant decline in Ford Credits consumer and nonconsumer originations Moreover COVID19 has had a significant negative impact on many businesses and unemployment rates increased from preCOVID19 levels Economic uncertainty and higher unemployment may result in higher defaults in Ford Credits consumer portfolio and prolonged unemployment may have a negative impact on both new and used vehicle demand The global economic slowdown and stayathome orders enacted across the United States disrupted auction activity in many locations which adversely impacted and caused delays in realizing the resale value for offlease and repossessed vehicles Although auction values have increased significantly future or additional restrictions could have a similar adverse impact on Ford Credit For more information about the impact of higher credit losses and lower residual values on Ford Credits business see Ford Credit could experience higherthanexpected credit losses lowerthananticipated residual values or higherthanexpected return volumes for leased vehicles below As described in more detail below under Ford and Ford Credits access to debt securitization or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades market volatility market disruption regulatory requirements or other factors the volatility created by COVID19 adversely affected Ford Credits access to the debt and securitization markets and its cost of funding and any volatility in the capital markets as a result of a surge in cases of COVID19 new outbreaks or variants or for any other reason could have an adverse impact on Ford Credits access to those markets and its cost of funding 17 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued The full impact of COVID19 on our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and will depend on future developments such as the ultimate duration and scope of the outbreak including any potential future waves the emergence or reemergence of variants and their transmissibility and the success of vaccination programs and treatments its impact on our customers dealers and suppliers how quickly normal economic conditions operations and the demand for our products can resume and any permanent behavioral changes that the pandemic may cause For example in the event manufacturing operations are again suspended fully ramping up our production schedule to prior levels may take longer than the prior resumption and will depend in part on whether our suppliers and dealers have resumed normal operations Our automotive operations generally do not realize revenue while our manufacturing operations are suspended but we continue to incur operating and nonoperating expenses resulting in a deterioration of our cash flow Accordingly any significant future disruption to our production schedule regionally or globally whether as a result of our own or a suppliers suspension of operations could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations Further governmentsponsored liquidity or stimulus programs in response to COVID19 may not be available to our customers suppliers dealers or us and if available may nevertheless be insufficient to address the impacts of COVID19 Moreover our supply and distribution chains may be disrupted by supplier or dealer bankruptcies or their permanent discontinuation of operations The COVID19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks disclosed in our 2021 Form 10K Report including but not limited to our competitiveness demand or market acceptance for our products and services and shifting consumer preferences and our ability to successfully execute our strategy Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Fords production schedule and a shortage of key components such as semiconductors or raw materials can disrupt Fords production of vehicles Our products contain components that we source globally from suppliers who in turn source components from their suppliers If there is a shortage of a key component in our supply chain and the component cannot be easily sourced from a different supplier the shortage may disrupt our production For example the automotive industry continues to face a significant shortage of semiconductors which has a complex supply chain with long lead times required to increase production and capacity The shortage is due in large part to strong crossindustry demand which has presented challenges and production disruptions globally including at our assembly plants In addition Renesas Electronics Corporation a key supplier of semiconductors for the automotive industry and for us in particular experienced a significant fire at its Naka Factory in March 2021 and COVIDrelated work restrictions in Southeast Asia have further impacted semiconductor production With up to fifty modules on a vehicle we and our competitors who need integrated circuits are experiencing various levels of semiconductor impact A shortage of key components or raw materials as a result of disruptions in the supply chain capacity constraints competition for those items within the automotive industry and other sectors or otherwise can cause a significant disruption to our production schedule and have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations Fords longterm competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford We previously announced our plan for growth and value creation Ford Ford is focused on delivering distinctive and increasingly electric products plus AlwaysOn customer relationships and user experiences Our Ford plan is designed to leverage our foundational strengths to build new capabilities enriching customer experiences and deepening loyalty As we undertake this transformation of our business we must integrate our strategic initiatives into a cohesive business model and balance competing priorities or we will not be successful To facilitate this transformation we are making substantial investments recruiting new talent and optimizing our business model management system and organization Accordingly maintaining discipline in our capital allocation continues to be important as a strong core business and a balance sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in these new growth opportunities is critical to the success of our Ford plan If we are unable to optimize our capital allocation among vehicles services technology and other calls on capital or we are otherwise not successful in executing Ford or are delayed for reasons outside of our control we may not be able to realize the full benefits of our plan which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations Furthermore if we fail to make progress on our plan at the pace that shareholders expect it may lead to an increase in shareholder activism which may disrupt the conduct of our business and divert managements attention and resources 18 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Fords vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches recall campaigns or increased warranty costs Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard NHTSAs enforcement strategy has resulted in significant civil penalties being levied and the use of consent orders requiring direct oversight by NHTSA of certain manufacturers safety processes a trend that could continue Should we or government safety regulators determine that a safety or other defect or a noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles prior to the start of production the launch of such vehicle could be delayed until such defect is remedied The cost of recall and customer satisfaction actions to remedy defects in vehicles that have been sold could be substantial particularly if the actions relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production For example NHTSA and the automotive industry are currently engaged in a study of the safety of approximately 56 million Takata desiccated airbag inflators in the United States Of these approximately three and a half million of the inflators are in our vehicles Should NHTSA determine that the inflators contain a safety defect Ford and other manufacturers could potentially face significant incremental recall costs Further to the extent recall and customer satisfaction actions relate to defective components we receive from suppliers our ability to recover from the suppliers may be limited by the suppliers financial condition We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time a vehicle is sold and we reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis In addition from time to time we issue extended warranties at our expense the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance For additional information regarding warranty and field service action costs including our process for establishing our reserves see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 and Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements If warranty costs are greater than anticipated as a result of increased vehicle and component complexity the adoption of new technologies or otherwise such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations Furthermore launch delays recall actions and increased warranty costs could adversely affect our reputation or market acceptance of our products as discussed below under Fords new and existing products digital and physical services and mobility services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive mobility and digital services industries Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances joint ventures acquisitions divestitures or new business strategies We have invested in formed strategic alliances with and announced or formed joint ventures with a number of companies and we may expand those relationships or enter into similar relationships with additional companies These initiatives typically involve enormous complexity and may involve a lengthy regulatory approval process As a result we may not be able to complete anticipated transactions the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be realized or the benefits may be delayed For example we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations including the implementation of our controls systems procedures and policies or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were not discovered during due diligence prior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance or a misalignment of interests may develop between us and the other party Further to the extent we share ownership control or management with another party in a joint venture our ability to influence the joint venture may be limited and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control systems In addition implementation of a new business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations including distracting management from current operations Results of operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities and if a strategy is unsuccessful we may not recoup our investments which may be significant in that strategy Moreover we may continue to have financial exposure following a strategic divestiture or cessation of operations in a market and restructuring actions may subject us to potential claims from employees suppliers dealers or governmental authorities or harm our reputation Failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions or strategies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 19 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Operational systems security systems vehicles and services could be affected by cyber incidents ransomware attacks and other disruptions We rely on information technology networks and systems including invehicle systems and mobile devices some of which are managed by suppliers to process transmit and store electronic information that is important to the operation of our business our vehicles and the services we offer Despite security measures we are at risk for interruptions outages and compromises of i operational systems including business financial accounting product development consumer receivables data processing or manufacturing processes ii facility security systems andor iii invehicle systems or mobile devices whether caused by a ransomware or other cyber attack security breach or other reasons eg a natural disaster fire or overburdened infrastructure system Such incidents could materially disrupt operational systems result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information compromise the privacy of personal information of consumers employees or others jeopardize the security of our facilities affect the performance of invehicle systems or services we offer andor impact the safety of our vehicles This risk exposure rises as we continue to develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity Moreover we our suppliers and our dealers have been the target of cyber attacks in the past and such attacks will continue and evolve in the future which may cause cyber incidents to be more difficult to detect for periods of time Our networks and invehicle systems sharing similar architectures could also be impacted by or a data breach may result from the negligence or misconduct of insiders or third parties who have access to our networks and systems We continually employ capabilities processes and other security measures designed to reduce and mitigate the risk of cyber attacks however such preventative measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all potential risks Moreover a cyber incident could harm our reputation cause customers to lose trust in our security measures andor subject us to regulatory actions or litigation and a cyber incident involving us or one of our suppliers could impact production our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers Fords production as well as Fords suppliers production could be disrupted by labor issues natural or manmade disasters financial distress production difficulties capacity limitations or other factors A work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at Fords or its suppliers facilities for any number of reasons including as a result of labor issues including disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements absenteeism public health issues eg COVID19 stayathome orders or in response to potential restructuring actions eg plant closures as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints such as limited quantities of components including but not limited to semiconductors or raw materials quality issues capacity limitations or other difficulties as a result of a natural disaster including climaterelated physical risk cyber incidents or for other reasons Many components used in our vehicles are available only from a single or limited number of suppliers and therefore cannot be resourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier due to long lead times new contractual commitments that may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the components or materials etc Such suppliers also could threaten to disrupt our production as leverage in negotiations In addition when we undertake a model changeover significant downtime at one or more of our production facilities may be required and our ability to return to full production may be delayed if we experience production difficulties at one of our facilities or a suppliers facility Moreover as vehicles components and their integration become more complex we may face an increased risk of a delay in production of new vehicles Regardless of the cause our ability to recoup lost production volume may be limited Accordingly a significant disruption to our production schedule could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards as discussed below under Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with safety emissions fuel economy autonomous vehicle and other regulations Fords ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints Substantially all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations in the United States and Canada are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements These agreements provide guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the contract term and some degree of income security subject to certain conditions These agreements may restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses A substantial number of our employees in other regions are represented by unions or government councils and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other employment in the state country or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or other facilities 20 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Fords ability to attract and retain talented diverse and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and competitiveness Our success depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain talented and diverse employees who are highly skilled in engineering software technology including digital capabilities and connectivity marketing and finance among other areas Competition for such employees is intense which has led to an increase in compensation throughout the labor market and accordingly may increase costs for employers In addition to compensation considerations potential employees are increasingly placing a premium on various intangibles such as working for companies with a clear purpose flexible work arrangements and other considerations If we are not perceived as an employer of choice we may be unable to recruit highly skilled employees Further if we lose existing employees with needed skills or we are unable to upskill and develop existing employees particularly with the introduction of new technologies it could have a substantial adverse effect on our business Macroeconomic Market and Strategic Risks Fords new and existing products digital and physical services and mobility services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive mobility and digital services industries Although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicles and introducing new services many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace and we may not be able to accurately predict or identify emerging trends or the success of new products or services in the market It takes years to design and develop a new vehicle or change an existing vehicle Because customers preferences may change quickly our new and existing products may not generate sales in sufficient quantities and at costs low enough to be profitable and recoup investment costs Offering vehicles and services that customers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand but products and services that are perceived to be less desirable whether in terms of price quality styling safety overall value fuel efficiency or other attributes can exacerbate these risks For example if we are unable to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors develop innovative new products and services or sufficiently tailor our products and services to customers in other markets there could be insufficient demand for our products and services which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet social media and other media mere allegations relating to quality safety fuel efficiency corporate social responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services even where such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded Further our ability to successfully grow through capacity expansion and investments in the areas of electrification connectivity digital and physical services and mobility depends on many factors including advancements in technology regulatory changes infrastructure development eg a widespread vehicle charging network and other factors that are difficult to predict that may significantly affect the future of electric and autonomous vehicles digital and physical services and mobility services The automotive mobility and digital service businesses are very competitive and are undergoing rapid changes Traditional competitors are expanding their offerings and new types of competitors particularly in our areas of strength eg pickup trucks and utilities that may possess superior technology may have business models with certain aspects that are more efficient and are not subject to the same level of fixed costs as us are entering the market This level of competition increases the importance of our ability to anticipate develop and deliver products and services that customers desire on a timely basis in quantities in line with demand and at costs low enough to be profitable We have announced our intent to continue making multibillion dollar investments in electrification and mobility Our plans include offering electrified versions of many of our vehicles including the F150 Lightning and ETransit If the market for electrified vehicles does not develop at the rate we expect even if the regulatory framework encourages a rapid adoption of electrified vehicles there is a negative perception of our vehicles or about electric vehicles in general or if consumers prefer our competitors vehicles there could be an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations Further as discussed below under Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with safety emissions fuel economy autonomous vehicle and other regulations lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards Moreover new offerings including those related to electric and autonomous vehicles may present technological challenges that could be costly to implement and overcome and may subject us to customer claims if they do not operate as anticipated In addition since new technologies are subject to market acceptance a malfunction involving any manufacturers autonomous vehicle may negatively impact the perception of autonomous vehicles and erode customer trust 21 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Fords nearterm results are dependent on sales of larger more profitable vehicles particularly in the United States A shift in consumer preferences away from larger more profitable vehicles with internal combustion engines including trucks and utilities to battery electric or other vehicles in our portfolio that may be less profitable could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the near term In the longer term if demand for battery electric vehicles grows at a rate greater than our ability to increase our production capacity for those vehicles lower market share and revenue as well as facility and other assetrelated charges eg accelerated depreciation associated with the production of internal combustion vehicles may result With a global footprint Fords results could be adversely affected by economic geopolitical protectionist trade policies or other events including tariffs With the interconnectedness of the global economy the challenges of a pandemic a financial crisis economic downturn or recession natural disaster geopolitical crisis or other significant event in one area of the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on markets around the world Changes in international trade policy can also have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations Steps taken by the US government to apply or consider applying tariffs on automobiles parts and other products and materials have the potential to disrupt existing supply chains impose additional costs on our business and may lead to other countries attempting to retaliate by imposing tariffs which would make our products more expensive for customers in other markets and in turn could make our products less competitive China presents unique risks to US automakers due to the strain in USChina relations and Chinas unique regulatory landscape We have operations in various markets with volatile economic or political environments This may expose us to heightened risks of economic geopolitical or other events including governmental takeover ie nationalization of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual property restrictive exchange or import controls disruption of operations as a result of systemic political or economic instability outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities and acts of terrorism each of which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations Further the US government other governments and international organizations could impose additional sanctions that could restrict us from doing business directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties which could include affiliates Industry sales volume in any of Fords key markets can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis recession or significant geopolitical event Because we like other manufacturers have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs relatively small changes in industry sales volume can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and results of operations Industry vehicle sales are affected by overall economic and market conditions and developing trends such as shared vehicle ownership and the transportation as a service model eg ridesharing services If industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption for key markets including the United States Europe or China the decline could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow For a discussion of economic trends see Item 7 Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity currency fluctuations competitive actions or other factors The global automotive industry is intensely competitive with manufacturing capacity generally far exceeding current demand the recent capacity constraints being a temporary exception Historically industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share these incentives historically have included a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs price rebates and other incentives As a result we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher marketing incentives commodity or other cost increases tariffs or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations including cost advantages foreign competitors may have because of their weaker home market currencies which may in turn enable those competitors to offer their products at lower prices As the automotive industry transitions to battery electric vehicles excess capacity particularly for internal combustion engine trucks and utilities may continue or increase This excess capacity may further increase price competition in that segment of the market which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 22 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market value of Ford or Ford Credits investments including marketable securities can have a significant effect on results We are exposed to inflationary pressure and a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business Changes in commodity prices from tariffs as discussed above under With a global footprint Fords results could be adversely affected by economic geopolitical protectionist trade policies or other events including tariffs or otherwise currency exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted hedged or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility As a result significant changes in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations See Item 7 and Item 7A for additional discussion of currency commodity price and interest rate risks In addition our results are impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments including our Rivian marketable securities with unrealized gains and losses that could be material in any period Financial Risks Ford and Ford Credits access to debt securitization or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades market volatility market disruption regulatory requirements or other factors Ford and Ford Credits ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost is dependent on their credit ratings or their perceived creditworthiness Further Ford Credits ability to obtain securitized funding under its committed assetbacked liquidity programs and certain other assetbacked securitization transactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs as well as Ford Credits ability to obtain appropriate credit ratings and for certain committed programs derivatives to manage the interest rate risk Over time and particularly in the event of credit rating downgrades market volatility market disruption or other factors Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints The discontinuance of LIBOR is one such risk that could cause market volatility or disruption and could adversely affect Ford Credits access to the debt securitization or derivative markets and increase its cost of funding and hedging In addition Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there is a significant decline in the demand for the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its securitization transactions A significant reduction in the amount of receivables Ford Credit purchases or originates would significantly reduce its ongoing results of operations and could adversely affect its ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles Fords receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction termination or clawback We receive economic benefits from national state and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish maintain or increase investment workforce or production These incentives may take various forms including grants loan subsidies or tax abatements or credits The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period A decrease in expiration without renewal of or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units as a result of administrative decision or otherwise could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations Until 2021 most of our manufacturing facilities in South America were located in Brazil where the state or federal governments historically offered significant incentives to manufacturers to encourage capital investment increase manufacturing production and create jobs As a result the performance of our South American operations had been impacted favorably by government incentives to a substantial extent The federal government in Brazil has levied assessments against us concerning the federal incentives we previously received and the State of SÃ£o Paulo has challenged the grant to us of tax incentives by the State of Bahia See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting for government incentives and Item 3 Legal Proceedings for a discussion of tax proceedings in Brazil and the potential requirement for us to post collateral 23 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Ford Credit could experience higherthanexpected credit losses lowerthananticipated residual values or higherthanexpected return volumes for leased vehicles Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customers or dealers failure to make payments according to contract terms Credit risk which is heavily dependent upon economic factors including unemployment consumer debt service burden personal income growth dealer profitability and used car prices has a significant impact on Ford Credits business The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations In addition Ford Credit projects expected residual values including residual value support payments from Ford and return volumes for the vehicles it leases Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected which would reduce Ford Credits return on the lease transaction Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume and mix of vehicles returned industrywide economic conditions marketing programs and quality or perceived quality safety fuel efficiency or reliability of the vehicles or changes in propulsion technology and related legislative changes Actual return volumes may be influenced by these factors as well as by contractual leaseend values relative to auction values In 2021 Ford Credit experienced lowerthanexpected return volumes If auction values decrease significantly in the future return volumes could exceed Ford Credits expectations Each of these factors alone or in combination has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credits results of operations if actual results were to differ significantly from Ford Credits projections See Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 for additional discussion Economic and demographic experience for pension and other postretirement benefit plans eg discount rates or investment returns could be worse than Ford has assumed The measurement of our obligations costs and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates including assumptions related to discount rates investment returns on designated plan assets and demographic experience eg mortality and retirement rates We generally remeasure these estimates at each year end and recognize any gains or losses associated with changes to our plan assets and liabilities in the year incurred To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions we may recognize a remeasurement loss in our results which could be substantial For additional information regarding our assumptions see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Fords liquidity and financial condition We have defined benefit retirement plans in the United States that cover many of our hourly and salaried employees We also provide pension benefits to nonUS employees and retirees primarily in Europe In addition we sponsor plans to provide other postretirement benefits OPEB for retired employees primarily health care and life insurance benefits See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information about these plans These benefit plans impose significant liabilities on us and could require us to make additional cash contributions which could impair our liquidity If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to meet any pension or OPEB obligations we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures suspend dividend payments seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness Legal and Regulatory Risks Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation governmental investigations or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products services perceived environmental impacts or otherwise We spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with governmental safety regulations mobile and stationary source emissions regulations consumer and automotive financial regulations and other standards but we cannot ensure that employees or other individuals affiliated with us will not violate such laws or regulations In addition as discussed below under Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with safety emissions fuel economy autonomous vehicle and other regulations and Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations consumer protection regulations or other regulations regulatory standards and interpretations may change on short notice and impact our compliance status Moreover compliance with governmental standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits which can entail significant cost and risk In certain circumstances courts may permit civil actions even where our vehicles services and financial products comply with federal andor other applicable law Furthermore simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards whether related to our products services or business or commercial relationships requires significant expenditures of time and other resources Litigation also is inherently uncertain and we could experience significant adverse results which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations In addition adverse publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could have a significant adverse effect on our sales 24 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with safety emissions fuel economy autonomous vehicle and other regulations The automotive industry is subject to regulations worldwide that govern product characteristics and that differ by global region country and sometimes within national boundaries Further additional and new regulations continue to be proposed to address concerns regarding the environment including concerns about global climate change and its impact vehicle safety and energy independence and the regulatory landscape can change on short notice In the United States legal and policy debates are continuing with a primary focus on reducing GHG emissions and increasing vehicle electrification The Trump administration rolled back Obama administration GHG standards through the 2026 model year and sought to block Californias authority to adopt its own regulations as well as other states authority to opt in to Californias standards States environmental groups and others challenged both of those Trump administration actions in court The Biden administration has completed actions to reverse the rollback of GHG emissions standards and repeal a NHTSA rule blocking California and other states authority and the administration is expected to reverse NHTSAs rollback of fuel economy standards and EPAs action blocking California and other states authority California has an ambitious plan to reduce overall GHG emissions to 40 below 1990 levels by 2030 and EPA is also developing new and more stringent GHG emissions standards after the 2026 model year Court rulings and actions by federal California and other state regulators create regulatory uncertainty and the potential for applicable regulatory standards to change quickly In addition many governments regulate local product content andor impose import requirements with the aim of creating jobs protecting domestic producers and influencing the balance of payments We are continuing to make changes to our product cycle plan to improve the fuel economy of our petroleumpowered vehicles and to offer more propulsion choices such as electrified vehicles with lower GHG emissions There are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame however primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies consumer acceptance of new technologies and changes in vehicle mix as described in more detail above under Fords new and existing products digital and physical services and mobility services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive mobility and digital services industries willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies the appropriateness or lack thereof of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles the widespread availability or lack thereof of supporting infrastructure for new technologies and the human engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time If fuel prices are relatively low and market conditions do not drive consumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuelefficient vehicles in large numbers it may be difficult to meet applicable environmental standards without compromising results Moreover a production disruption stop ship limited availability of necessary components eg batteries lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product plans or in some cases purchase credits in order to comply with fuel economy standards which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations andor cause reputational harm Increased scrutiny of automaker emission testing by regulators around the world has led to new regulations more stringent enforcement programs requests for field actions demands for reporting on the field performance of emissions components and higher scrutiny of field data andor delays in regulatory approvals The cost to comply with existing government regulations in addition to the cost of any field service actions that may result from regulatory actions is substantial and additional regulations changes in regulatory interpretations or changes in consumer preferences that affect vehicle mix could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations In addition a number of governments as well as nongovernmental organizations publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols The protocols could change and any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicles subjected to such tests could reduce future sales Court decisions arising out of consumer and investor litigation could give rise to de facto changes in the interpretation of existing emission laws and regulations thereby imposing new burdens on manufacturers For more discussion of the impact of standards on our global business see the Governmental Standards discussion in Item 1 Business above We and other companies continue to develop autonomous vehicle technologies and the US and foreign governments are continuing to develop the regulatory framework that will govern autonomous vehicles The evolution of the regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles and the pace of the development of such regulatory framework may subject us to increased costs and uncertainty and may ultimately impact our ability to deliver autonomous vehicles and related services that customers want 25 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy data use and data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information We are subject to laws rules guidelines from privacy regulators and regulations in the United States and other countries such as the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act relating to the collection use crossborder data transfer and security of personal information of consumers employees or others including laws that may require us to notify regulators and affected individuals of a data security incident Existing and newly developed laws and regulations may contain broad definitions of personal information are subject to change and uncertain interpretations by courts and regulators and may be inconsistent from state to state or country to country Accordingly complying with such laws and regulations may lead to a decline in consumer engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs to modify our operations or business practices Moreover regulatory actions seeking to impose significant financial penalties for noncompliance andor legal actions including pursuant to laws providing for private rights of action by consumers could be brought against us in the event of a data compromise misuse of consumer information or perceived or actual noncompliance with data protection or privacy requirements Further any unauthorized release of personal information could harm our reputation disrupt our business cause us to expend significant resources and lead to a loss of consumer confidence resulting in an adverse impact on our business andor consumers deciding to withhold or withdraw consent for our collection or use of data Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations consumer protection regulations or other regulations As a finance company Ford Credit is highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations in which it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business In the United States for example Ford Credits operations are subject to regulation and supervision under various federal state and local laws including the federal TruthinLending Act Consumer Leasing Act Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act The DoddFrank Act directs federal agencies to adopt rules to regulate the finance industry and the capital markets and gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB broad rulemaking and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that regulate consumer finance businesses such as Ford Credits automotive financing business Exercise of these powers by the CFPB may increase the costs of impose additional restrictions on or otherwise adversely affect companies in the automotive finance business The CFPB has authority to supervise and examine the largest nonbank automotive finance companies such as Ford Credit for compliance with consumer financial protection laws Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject Ford Credit to regulatory enforcement actions including consent orders or similar orders where Ford Credit may be required to revise practices remunerate customers or pay fines An enforcement action against Ford Credit could harm Ford Credits reputation or lead to further litigation ITEM 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None 26 ITEM 2 Properties Our principal properties include manufacturing and assembly facilities distribution centers warehouses sales or

adequate for the manufacture and assembly of our and our joint ventures products The furniture equipment and other physical property owned by our Ford Credit operations are not material in relation to the operations total assets ITEM 3 Legal Proceedings The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of loss contingencies Following is a discussion of our significant pending legal proceedings PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS We are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts within and outside of the United States alleging damages from injuries resulting from or aggravated by alleged defects in our vehicles In many actions no monetary amount of damages is specified or the specific amount alleged is the jurisdictional minimum Our experience with litigation alleging a specific amount of damages suggests that such amounts on average bear little relation to the actual amount of damages if any that we will pay in resolving such matters In addition to pending actions we assess the likelihood of incidents that likely have occurred but not yet been reported to us We also take into consideration specific matters that have been raised as claims but have not yet proceeded to litigation Individual product liability matters that have more than a remote risk of loss and such loss would likely be significant if the matter is resolved unfavorably to us would be described herein Currently there are no such matters to report ASBESTOS MATTERS Asbestos was used in some brakes clutches and other automotive components from the early 1900s Along with other vehicle manufacturers we have been the target of asbestos litigation and as a result are a defendant in various actions for injuries claimed to have resulted from alleged exposure to Ford parts and other products containing asbestos Plaintiffs in these personal injury cases allege various health problems as a result of asbestos exposure either from component parts found in older vehicles insulation or other asbestos products in our facilities or asbestos aboard our former maritime fleet We believe that we are targeted more aggressively in asbestos suits because many previously targeted companies have filed for bankruptcy or emerged from bankruptcy relieved of liability for such claims 28 Item 3 Legal Proceedings Continued Most of the asbestos litigation we face involves individuals who claim to have worked on the brakes of our vehicles We are prepared to defend these cases and believe that the scientific evidence confirms our longstanding position that there is no increased risk of asbestosrelated disease as a result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the brakes on our vehicles The extent of our financial exposure to asbestos litigation remains very difficult to estimate and could include both compensatory and punitive damage awards The majority of our asbestos cases do not specify a dollar amount for damages in many of the other cases the dollar amount specified is the jurisdictional minimum and the vast majority of these cases involve multiple defendants sometimes more than one hundred Many of these cases also involve multiple plaintiffs and often we are unable to tell from the pleadings which plaintiffs are making claims against us as opposed to other defendants Annual payout and defense costs may become significant in the future Our accrual for asbestos matters includes probable losses for both asserted and unasserted claims CONSUMER MATTERS We provide warranties on the vehicles we sell Warranties are offered for specific periods of time andor mileage and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale Pursuant to these warranties we will repair replace or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factorysupplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period We are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts alleging breach of warranty and claiming damages based on state and federal consumer protection laws Remedies under these statutes may include vehicle repurchase civil penalties and payment by Ford of the plaintiffs attorneys fees In some cases plaintiffs also include an allegation of fraud Remedies for a fraud claim may include contract rescission vehicle repurchase and punitive damages The cost of these litigation matters is included in our warranty costs We accrue obligations for warranty costs at the time of sale using a patterned estimation model that includes historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis We are currently a defendant in a significant number of litigation matters relating to the performance of vehicles including those equipped with DPS6 transmissions ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We have received notices under various federal and state environmental laws that we along with others are or may be a potentially responsible party for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage recycling or disposal sites in many states and in some instances for natural resource damages We also may have been a generator of hazardous substances at a number of other sites The amount of any such costs or damages for which we may be held responsible could be significant At this time we have no legal proceedings arising under any federal state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment in which i a governmental authority is a party and ii we believe there is the possibility of monetary sanctions exclusive of interest and costs in excess of 1000000 CLASS ACTIONS In light of the fact that few of the purported class actions filed against us in the past have been certified by the courts as class actions in general we list those actions that i have been certified as a class action by a court of competent jurisdiction and any additional purported class actions that raise allegations substantially similar to an existing and certified class and ii have more than a remote risk of loss and such loss would likely be significant if the action is resolved unfavorably to us At this time we have no such class actions filed against us 29 Item 3 Legal Proceedings Continued OTHER MATTERS Brazilian Tax Matters One Brazilian state SÃ£o Paulo and the Brazilian federal tax authority currently have outstanding substantial tax assessments against Ford Motor Company Brasil Ltda Ford Brazil related to state and federal tax incentives Ford Brazil received for its operations in the Brazilian state of Bahia The SÃ£o Paulo assessment is part of a broader conflict among various states in Brazil The federal legislature enacted laws designed to encourage the states to end that conflict and in 2017 the states reached an agreement on a framework for resolution Ford Brazil continues to pursue a resolution under the framework and expects the amount of any remaining assessments by the states to be resolved under that framework The federal assessments are outside the scope of the legislation All of the outstanding assessments have been appealed to the relevant administrative court of each jurisdiction To proceed with an appeal within the judicial court system an appellant may be required to post collateral To date we have not been required to post any collateral If we are required to post collateral which could be in excess of 1 billion we expect it to be in the form of fixed assets surety bonds andor letters of credit but we may be required to post cash collateral Although the ultimate resolution of these matters may take many years we consider our overall risk of loss to be remote European Competition Law Matter On October 5 2018 FCE Bank plc FCE received a notice from the Italian Competition Authority the ICA concerning an alleged violation of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union The ICA alleged that FCE and other parties engaged in anticompetitive practices in relation to the automotive finance market in Italy On January 9 2019 FCE received a decision from the ICA which included an assessment of a fine against FCE in the amount of 42 million On March 8 2019 FCE appealed the decision and the fine to the Italian administrative court and on November 24 2020 the Italian administrative court ruled in favor of FCE On December 23 2020 the ICA filed an appeal of the Italian administrative courts decision to the Italian Council of State and a hearing on the appeal was held on January 13 2022 On February 1 2022 the Italian Council of State dismissed the ICAs appeal Emissions Certification Beginning in 2018 and continuing into 2020 the Company investigated a potential concern involving its US emissions certification process The matter focused on issues related to road load estimations including analytical modeling and coastdown testing The potential concern did not involve the use of defeat devices see Item 1 Governmental Standards for a definition of defeat devices We voluntarily disclosed this matter to the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the California Air Resources Board CARB on February 18 2019 and February 21 2019 respectively Subsequently the US Department of Justice DOJ opened a criminal investigation into the matter In addition we notified a number of other state and federal agencies We cooperated fully with these government agencies We received notifications from EPA CARB and DOJ that these agencies have closed their inquiries into the matter and do not intend to take any further action Environment and Climate Change Canadas request for information has been completed Transit Connect Customs Penalty Notice US Customs and Border Protection CBP ruled in 2013 that Transit Connects imported as passenger wagons and later converted into cargo vans are subject to the 25 duty applicable to cargo vehicles rather than the 25 duty applicable to passenger vehicles We filed a challenge in the US Court of International Trade CIT and CIT ruled in our favor in 2017 CBP subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which ruled in favor of CBP Following the US Supreme Courts denial of our petition for a writ of certiorari in 2020 we paid the increased duties for certain prior imports plus interest and disclosed that CBP might assert a claim for penalties Subsequently CBP issued a penalty notice to us dated July 22 2021 and on November 18 2021 CBP assessed against us a monetary penalty of 13 billion and additional duties of 181 million plus interest We intend to vigorously defend our actions and contest payment of the penalty and the additional duties ITEM 4 Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable 30 ITEM 4A Executive Officers of Ford Our executive officers are as follows along with each executive officers

Supplier Disruptions The automotive industry has a complex supply network with each manufacturers products containing components sourced from suppliers who in turn source components from their suppliers When there is a shortage of a key component in our supply chain and the component cannot be easily sourced from a different supplier the shortage can disrupt production Since early 2021 we and others in the automotive industry have faced a significant shortage of semiconductors The global semiconductor shortage is due in large part to makers of semiconductors having allocated their capacity to meet surging demand for consumer electronics during the COVID19 pandemic while automotive OEMs experienced industrywide plant closures At the same time wafer foundries that support chipmakers have not invested enough in recent years to increase capacities to the levels needed to support demand from all of their customers Wafers have a long lead time for production which further exacerbates the shortage When global automakers resumed vehicle production in 2020 even more quickly than some expected semiconductor supplies became further strained A combination of these factors including increased demand for consumer electronics automotive shutdowns due to COVID19 the rapid recovery of demand for vehicles and long lead times for wafer production is contributing to the ongoing shortage of semiconductors For additional information on the impact of the semiconductor shortage see the Outlook section on page 73 COVID19 The impact of COVID19 including changes in consumer behavior pandemic fears and market downturns and restrictions on business and individual activities has created significant volatility in the global economy Consistent with the actions taken by governmental authorities in late March 2020 we idled our manufacturing operations in regions around the world other than China where manufacturing operations were suspended in January and February before beginning to resume operations in March A successful phased restart of our manufacturing plants supply network and other dependent functions occurred in the second quarter of 2020 The remote work arrangements that we implemented in 2020 remain in place in most locations Our remote work arrangements have been designed to allow for continued operation of nonproduction businesscritical functions including financial reporting systems and internal control The full impact of COVID19 on future results depends on future developments such as the ultimate duration and scope of outbreaks including any potential future waves due to variants or otherwise and the success of vaccination programs and their impact on our customers dealers and suppliers Despite the successful restart of our manufacturing operations in 2020 we continue to experience intermittent COVID19related disruptions in our supply chain Moreover new restrictions could have an adverse effect on production supply chains distribution and demand for vehicles For additional information on the impact and potential impact of COVID19 on us please see Item 1A Risk Factors on page 17 Global Redesign We previously announced our plan for the global redesign of our business pursuant to which we are working to turn around automotive operations compete like a challenger and capitalize on our strengths by allocating more capital more resources and more talent to our strongest business and vehicle franchises Pursuant to the plan we expect to incur about 11 billion of EBIT charges with about 7 billion of cash effects related to our global redesign efforts During the 2018 through 2022 period we expect to have incurred the vast majority of the 11 billion of EBIT charges For additional information on Global Redesign see the Outlook section on page 73 Currency Exchange Rate Volatility After aggressively easing monetary policy in response to the COVID19 pandemic the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world are poised to withdraw monetary stimulus by raising interest rates The last time the Fed shifted from easing to tightening from 2013 through 2017 the US dollar strengthened and financial markets became more volatile Increased volatility in both developed and emerging market currencies may again be a result of policy tightening Emerging markets also face differing inflation backdrops and in some cases exposure to commodity prices and political instability contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates In addition to direct impacts on the financial flows of global automotive companies currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets most notably in the case of the Japanese yen and Korean won In most markets exchange rates are marketdetermined and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors and thus likely to remain volatile However in some markets exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments 34 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Excess Capacity According to IHS Automotive an automotive research firm the estimated global production capacity for light vehicles of about 124 million units exceeded global production by just under 41 million units in 2021 Actual global production is projected to have risen by 89 million units in 2021 while capacity rose by just under 2 million units leading excess capacity to decline by just under 7 million units Part of the decline was due to the impact of COVID19related production disruptions but the rebound in 2021 production still left global excess capacity 1 above 2019 In North America the amount of excess capacity rose from 48 million units in 2019 to 75 million units in 2020 but then fell to 57 million units in 2021 Europe followed a similar pattern with excess capacity rising from 62 million units in 2019 to 106 million in 2020 but then declining to 86 million in 2021 In Asia however excess capacity declined from 193 million units in 2019 to 159 million in 2020 and to 152 million units in 2021 coming off a weak base for Chinas economy and automotive sector during 2018 and 2019 After the pandemicrelated disruptions ease IHS projects that global excess capacity will trend lower from around 49 of capacity in 2021 to just under 30 in 2028 Despite the projected gradual decline the amount of excess capacity will remain substantial and represents a risk to automotive prices and revenue Pricing Pressure Over the last year prices of both new and used vehicles have increased substantially due to both rising demand and supply shortages It is likely that the rate of price increases will slow down as auto production slowly recovers from the semiconductor shortage but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to preCOVID19 pandemic levels Over the long term intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflationadjusted prices for similarlycontented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets Commodity and Energy Price Changes The recovery from the COVID19 pandemic has driven energy prices higher over the last year Oil prices are expected to remain volatile and are likely to rise in the near term because of low global stocks In the long term the outcome of decarbonization may depress oil demand but the global energy transition will also contribute to volatility of oil and other energy prices Prices for other commodities have also been volatile though generally higher as fluctuating global demand and differences in output across sectors due to the pandemic have generated divergence in price movements across different commodities For additional information on commodity costs see the Outlook section on page 73 Vehicle Profitability Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell which may vary significantly by vehicle line In general larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles both across and within vehicle segments For example in North America our larger more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 118 of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins In addition government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency eg ZEV mandates and low emission zones and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins Trade Policy To the extent governments in various regions erect or intensify barriers to imports or implement currency policy that advantages local exporters selling into the global marketplace there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets While we believe the longterm trend will support the growth of free trade we have noted with concern recent developments in a number of regions In Asia Pacific a weak yen significantly reduces the cost of exports into the United States Europe and other global markets by Japanese manufacturers and over a period of time contribute to other countries pursuing weak currency policies by intervening in the exchange rate markets This is particularly likely in other Asian countries such as South Korea We believe the primary focus of the Biden administration will be addressing the COVID19 pandemic and moving ahead with economic stimulus We will continue to monitor and address developing issues Other Economic Factors Interest rates notably mature market government bond yields have remained lower than expected At the same time inflation has accelerated and government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many major markets The eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt tighter monetary policy and potentially higher longterm interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital over our planning period Higher interest rates andor taxes to address the higher deficits also may impede real growth in gross domestic product and therefore vehicle sales over our planning period 35 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Revenue Our Automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles parts and accessories Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers generally our dealers and distributors For the majority of sales this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities However we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or standready performance obligation such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations revenue related to other future or standready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase for a guaranteed amount exercisable at the option of the customer are accounted for as operating leases with lease revenue and profits recognized over the term of the lease Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealers purchase of a vehicle Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Automotive legal entity in payment of the dealers obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer Our Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables net of certain deferred origination costs that are included as a reduction of financing revenue and such revenue is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method Also revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the lease Income is generated to the extent revenues exceed expenses most of which are interest depreciation and operating expenses Transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments occur in the ordinary course of business For example we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealers customer Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments Costs and Expenses Our income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories i cost of sales and ii selling administrative and other expenses We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development production and distribution of our vehicles parts accessories and services Specifically we include in cost of sales each of the following material costs including commodity costs freight costs warranty including product recall costs labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity parts accessories and services depreciation and amortization and other associated costs We include within selling administrative and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles parts accessories and services including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs 36 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Certain of our costs such as material costs generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production In our industry production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel As a result we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant presentyear volume and mix and currency exchange in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels We analyze these cost changes in the following categories Contribution Costs these costs typically vary with production volume These costs include material including commodity warranty and freight and duty costs Structural Costs these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume These costs include manufacturing vehicle and software engineering spendingrelated advertising and sales promotion administrative information technology and selling and pension and OPEB costs While contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs For example depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions On the other hand while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume for example when we increase overtime add a production shift or add personnel to support volume increases Other structural costs such as advertising or engineering costs do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume Our structural costs generally are within our discretion although to varying degrees and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors We consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue For example structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability invest in new products and technologies respond to increasing industry sales volume and grow our market share Cost of sales and Selling administrative and other expenses for full year 2021 were 1266 billion Our Automotive segments material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses followed by structural costs Although material costs are our largest absolute cost our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs 37 Item 7

for offlease vehicles were up 25 from a year ago reflecting strong demand for used vehicles including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage We are planning for full year 2022 auction values to remain strong 46 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Ford Credits 2021 EBT increased 2109 million from a year ago explained primarily by favorable operating lease residual performance the nonrecurrence of the 2020 increase to the credit loss reserve due to deterioration in macroeconomic conditions related to COVID19 and reductions in the credit loss reserve in 2021 partially offset by lower volume driven by the impact of the global semiconductor shortage and lower financing margin 47 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors In general we measure yearoveryear changes in Ford Credits EBT using the causal factors listed below Volume and Mix Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average managed receivables at prior period financing margin yield defined below in financing margin at prior period exchange rates Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing the sales price of the vehicles financed the level of dealer inventories Fordsponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit and the availability of costeffective funding Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by periodoverperiod changes in the composition of Ford Credits average managed receivables by product within each region Financing Margin Financing margin variance is the periodtoperiod change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average managed receivables at prior period exchange rates This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated Financing margin yield equals revenue less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period divided by average managed receivables for the same period Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates cost assumptions in pricing mix of business and competitive environment Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates borrowing spreads and assetliability management Credit Loss Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates For analysis purposes management splits the provision for credit losses into net chargeoffs and the change in the allowance for credit losses Net chargeoff changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions severity per repossession and recoveries Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries changes in the composition and size of Ford Credits present portfolio changes in trends in historical used vehicle values and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions For additional information refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2021 Form 10K Report Lease Residual Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates For analysis purposes management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation of the vehicles sold Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credits estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term and changes in Ford Credits estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold For additional information refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2021 Form 10K Report Exchange Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to US dollars Other Primarily includes operating expenses other revenue insurance expenses and other income at prior period exchange rates Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs facilities costs and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts In general other income changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives primarily related to movements in interest rates and other miscellaneous items 48 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued In addition the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in

contractually obligated contributions to the FordWerke plan See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information regarding our expected 2021 pension contributions and funded status We plan to utilize our liquidity as described above and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements Changes in Company Cash In managing our business we classify changes in Company cash into operating and nonoperating items Operating items include Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT capital spending depreciation and tooling amortization changes in working capital Ford Credit distributions interest on debt cash taxes and all other and timing differences including timing differences between accrualbased EBIT and associated cash flows Nonoperating items include global redesign including separation payments changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit contributions to funded pension plans shareholder distributions and other items including gains and losses on investments in equity securities acquisitions and divestitures and other transactions with Ford Credit With respect to Changes in working capital in general we carry relatively low Automotive segment trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our Automotive wholesales are financed primarily by Ford Credit immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers which generally occurs shortly after being produced In contrast our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industrystandard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days As a result our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes and the corresponding revenue decrease while trade payables continue to become due Conversely our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes and the corresponding revenue increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days For example the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to preCOVID19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow Even in normal economic conditions however these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow For example we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes are usually at their lowest levels while payables continue to come due and be paid The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods 62 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Our inventory includes vehicles completed but awaiting installation of components affected by the semiconductor supply shortage As a result of the shortage our inventory in 2021 was higher than in prior years In response to or in anticipation of supplier disruptions we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles Such actions could have an adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers at their sole discretion to sell their Ford receivables ie our payment obligations to the suppliers to the financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms the amounts we pay or our liquidity We have no economic interest in a suppliers decision to participate in the SCF program and we have no direct financial relationship with the SCF financial institutions Moreover we do not provide any guarantees in connection with the SCF program As of December 31 2021 the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 178 million The amount settled through the SCF program during 2021 was 10 billion Changes in Company

page 78 for additional information The yearoveryear decrease was driven by adverse working capital and a decrease in Ford Credit operating cash flow Company adjusted free cash flow was 46 billion 33 billion higher than a year ago driven by higher Ford Credit distributions and Company adjusted EBIT Capital spending was 62 billion in 2021 05 billion higher than a year ago and is expected to be in the range of 70 billion to 80 billion in 2022 63 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued The full year 2021 working capital impact was 17 billion negative driven by higher inventory All other and timing differences were negative 31 billion reflecting assorted differences including differences between accrualbased EBIT and the associated cash flows eg marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers pension and OPEB income or expense We expect the working capital and timing differences to normalize when supply is restored dealer stocks rebound and incentives potentially increase Shareholder distributions were 400 million in 2021 all of which were attributable to the reinstatement of our regular quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter We previously announced our plan for the global redesign of our business pursuant to which we are working to turn around automotive operations compete like a challenger and capitalize on our strengths by allocating more capital more resources and more talent to our strongest business and vehicle franchises Beginning with the actions we took in 2018 we expect our global redesign to have a potential cash effect of about 7 billion The cash effect related to our global redesign activities was 35 billion through December 31 2021 For additional information on Global Redesign see the Outlook section on page 73 Available Credit Lines Total Company committed credit lines excluding Ford Credit at December 31 2021 were 183 billion consisting of 135 billion of our corporate credit facility 20 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility 15 billion of our delayed draw term loan facility and 13 billion of local credit facilities At December 31 2021 the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was 25 million representing amounts utilized for letters of credit and no portion of the supplemental revolving credit facility was utilized The 15 billion delayed draw term loan facility was drawn in full in 2019 and remains outstanding In addition 847 million of committed Company credit lines excluding Ford Credit was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of December 31 2021 Lenders under our corporate credit facility have 34 billion of commitments maturing on September 29 2024 and 101 billion of commitments maturing on September 29 2026 Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have 20 billion of commitments maturing on September 29 2024 In September 2021 we amended the corporate and supplemental credit agreements to remove the restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends In addition the agreements include certain sustainabilitylinked targets pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves or fails to achieve the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions renewable electricity consumption and Ford Europe CO tailpipe emissions Further interest on any US dollar borrowings under both the corporate and supplemental revolving credit facilities will be calculated using daily simple SOFR Prior to the amendments such interest was calculated using LIBOR The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing restrictive financial covenants for example interest or fixedcharge coverage ratio debttoequity ratio and minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash cash equivalents and loaned and marketable securities andor availability under the facility The terms and conditions of the delayed draw term loan other than the sustainabilitylinked provisions and the transition from LIBOR to SOFR and the supplemental revolving credit facility are consistent with our corporate credit facility Each of the corporate credit facility supplemental revolving credit facility delayed draw term loan and our Loan Arrangement and Reimbursement Agreement with the US Department of Energy the DOE include a covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior unsecured

Continued Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile Ford Credit defines its balance sheet liquidity profile as the cumulative maturities including the impact of expected prepayments and allowance for credit losses of its finance receivables investment in operating leases and cash less the cumulative debt maturities over upcoming annual periods Ford Credits balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the shortterm nature of its finance receivables investment in operating leases and cash Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities This positive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded and is in addition to liquidity available to protect for stress

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued NONGAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and nonGAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making and to assess Company and segment business performance The nonGAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures to aid investors in better understanding our financial results We believe that these nonGAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends and a means to compare our periodoverperiod results These nonGAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP These nonGAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted Company Adjusted EBIT Most Comparable GAAP Measure Net IncomeLoss Attributable to Ford Earnings before interest and taxes EBIT excludes interest on debt excl Ford Credit Debt taxes and pretax special items This nonGAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends and improves comparability of our periodoverperiod results Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources Our categories of pretax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action are as follows PreTax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses dealerrelated costs and facilityrelated charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions generally 100 million or more for other items When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities Company Adjusted EBIT Margin Most Comparable GAAP Measure Company Net IncomeLoss Margin Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue This nonGAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting Adjusted EarningsLoss Per Share Most Comparable GAAP Measure EarningsLoss Per Share Measure of Companys diluted net earningsloss per share adjusted for impact of pretax special items described above tax special items and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of the underlying run rate of our business When we provide guidance for adjusted earningsloss per share we do not provide guidance on an earningsloss per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to yearend including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Most Comparable GAAP Measure Effective Tax Rate Measure of Companys tax rate excluding pretax special items described above and tax special items The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to yearend including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses 75 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Credits operating cash flows The measure contains elements management considers operating activities including Automotive and Mobility capital spending Ford Credit distributions to its parent and settlement of derivatives The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions global redesign including separations and other items that are considered operating cash flows under US GAAP This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with managements assessment of the Companys operating cash flow performance When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow we do not provide guidance for net cash provided byused in operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty including cash flows related to the Companys exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices separate from any related hedges Ford Credits operating cash flows and cash flows related to special items including separation payments each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided byused in our

Net Investment in Operating Leases Measure of Ford Credits total net receivables excluding unearned interest supplements and residual support allowance for credit losses and other primarily accumulated supplemental depreciation The measure is useful to management and investors as it closely approximates the customers outstanding balance on the receivables which is the basis for earning revenue Ford Credit Managed Leverage Most Comparable GAAP Measure Financial Statement Leverage Ford Credits debttoequity ratio adjusted i to exclude cash cash equivalents and marketable securities other than amounts related to insurance activities and ii for derivative accounting The measure is useful to investors because it reflects the way Ford Credit manages its business Cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are deducted because they generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support operations and onbalance sheet securitization transactions Derivative accounting adjustments are made to asset debt and equity positions to reflect the impact of interest rate instruments used with Ford Credits termdebt issuances and securitization transactions Ford Credit generally repays its debt obligations as they mature so the interim effects of changes in market interest rates are excluded in the calculation of managed leverage 76 Item 7

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1 the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors In addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements Warranties and Field Service Actions Nature of Estimates Required We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time andor mileage which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale Separately we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls emission recalls and other product campaigns Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions we will repair replace or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factorysupplied materials or workmanship We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale In addition from time to time we issue extended warranties at our expense the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance Assumptions and Approach Used We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model We use historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile therefore our process relies on longterm historical averages until sufficient data are available With actual experience we use the data to update the historical averages We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations Based on this data we update our estimates as necessary Field service actions may occur in periods beyond the base warranty coverage period We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model We use historical information regarding the nature frequency severity and average cost of claims for each model year We assess our obligation for field service actions on a regular basis using actual claims experience and update our estimates as necessary Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors used in establishing our estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and field service action costs Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits Nature of Estimates Required The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as demographic experience and health care cost increases Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed eg in existing labor contracts 84 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Assumptions and Approach Used The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors Discount rates Our discount rate assumptions are based primarily on the results of cash flow matching analyses which match the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on highquality bonds specific to the country of the plan Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the yearend obligations Expected longterm rate of return on plan assets Our expected longterm rate of return considers inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns inflation bond yields and other variables adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan Historical returns also are considered when appropriate The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs with a focus on longterm trends to avoid shortterm market influences Salary growth Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience longterm outlook and assumed inflation Inflation Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets Expected contributions Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements cash availability and other considerations eg funded status avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies and tax efficiency Retirement rates Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience Mortality rates Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience Health care cost trends Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends Assumptions are set at each yearend and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event such as a curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions Pension Plans Effect of Actual Results The yearend 2021 weighted average discount rate was 291 for US plans and 175 for nonUS plans reflecting increases of 35 and 52 basis points respectively compared with yearend 2020 In 2021 the US actual return on assets was 282 which was lower than the expected longterm rate of return of 60 NonUS actual return on assets was 269 which was lower than the expected longterm rate of return of 342 The lower returns are primarily explained by losses on fixed income assets offset by growth asset returns in excess of our growth return assumptions In total higher rates and excess growth asset returns in addition to demographic and other updates resulted in a net remeasurement gain of 35 billion which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item For 2022 the expected longterm rate of return on assets is 575 for US plans down 25 basis points from 2021 and 329 for nonUS plans down 13 basis points compared with a year ago reflecting a lower consensus on capital market return expectations from advisors Derisking Strategy We employ a broad derisking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves Changes in interest rates which directly influence changes in discount rates in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio Our derisking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio 85 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Sensitivity Analysis The December 31 2021 pension funded status and 2022 expense are affected by yearend 2021 assumptions Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted The effects of changes in the factors that generally have the largest impact on yearend funded status and pension expense are discussed below Discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our obligations and fixed income assets The table

compared with 262 at December 31 2020 resulting in a worldwide net remeasurement gain of 376 million which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item

purposes We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas i the calculation of tax credits ii the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax reporting and financial statement purposes as well as iii the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs 86 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Assumptions and Approach Used We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws regulations and various related judicial opinions If in our judgment it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than 50 that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably for us we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized This process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized This assessment which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis takes into account various types of evidence including the following Nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses A pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence We generally consider cumulative pretax losses in the threeyear period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability We also consider the strength and trend of earnings as well as other relevant factors In certain circumstances historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations Sources of future taxable income Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated Otherwise these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has not yet been achieved In such cases we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment and Tax planning strategies If necessary and available tax planning strategies could be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and depending on their nature could be heavily weighted In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider the tradeoffs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits In 2021 we reversed 918 million of the previously established US valuation allowance The reversal primarily reflects a change in our intent to pursue planning actions involving cash outlays to preserve tax credits We presently believe that global valuation allowances of 11 billion are required We believe that we ultimately will recover the remaining 122 billion of deferred tax assets However the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is subject to a number of variables including our future profitability within relevant tax jurisdictions and future tax planning and the related effects on our cash and liquidity position Accordingly our valuation allowances may increase or decrease in future periods For additional information regarding income taxes see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements 87 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Impairment of LongLived Assets and Goodwill Asset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets Our asset groups presently are the regional Automotive business units ie North America South America Europe China including Taiwan and the International Markets Group Ford Credit and the separate legal entities within the Mobility segment Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting Nature of Estimates Required HeldandUsed LongLived Assets We test our longlived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses significant negative industry or economic trends including a substantial shift in consumer preference a current expectation that a longlived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition or when there is a change in the asset grouping When a triggering event occurs a test for recoverability is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment the asset groups fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method To the extent available we will also consider thirdparty valuations of our longlived assets that were prepared for other business purposes An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life Nature of Estimates Required Goodwill Goodwill is subject to periodic assessments of impairment We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the asset may be impaired We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill If a qualitative assessment identifies a possible impairment or we impair the assets of a reporting unit then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed If the carrying value of the reporting unit is above fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess Assumptions and Approach Used HeldandUsed LongLived Assets and Goodwill Fair value of an asset group is determined from the perspective of a marketparticipant considering among other things appropriate discount rates valuation techniques the most advantageous market and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group We measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices ie the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party when available When market prices are not available we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach andor the market approach The income approach uses cash flow projections Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plan forecasts expected growth rates and cost of capital similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and therefore can affect the test results The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections Business projections We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace These assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume mix and pricing We also make assumptions about our cost levels eg capacity utilization cost performance These projections are derived using our internal business plan forecasts that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our Board of Directors Longterm growth rate A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debtfree interim cash flows The growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset groups business units earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period 88 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Discount rate When measuring possible impairment future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use Weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall riskadjusted pretax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise Economic projections Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for our vehicles These macroeconomic assumptions include but are not limited to industry sales volumes inflation interest rates prices of raw materials eg commodities and foreign currency exchange rates The market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group This approach relies on the market value ie market capitalization of companies that are engaged in the same or similar line of business as the reporting unit or asset group being evaluated In addition to the extent available we also consider thirdparty valuations that were prepared for other business purposes During 2021 we continued to progress our global redesign by reassessing our operations and reducing structural costs As part of this redesign in 2020 Ford Brazil committed to a plan to exit manufacturing operations which resulted in the closure of facilities in CamaÃ§ari TaubatÃ© and Troller in 2021 In addition in 2021 Ford India committed to a plan to exit the engine and vehicle manufacturing operations at its facilities in Chennai and its vehicle manufacturing operation at its facility in Sanand Ford India ceased vehicle manufacturing in Sanand in the fourth quarter of 2021 and will cease engine and vehicle manufacturing in Chennai by the second quarter of 2022 Against this backdrop we determined that there were triggering events related to our South America and International Markets Group IMG business units In each situation in which we experienced a triggering event during the year we tested our longlived assets for impairment using our internal economic and business projections as well as thirdparty valuations of certain longlived assets We determined that the carrying values of the longlived assets were recoverable in these business units at December 31 2021 Although no impairment was required the carrying values of the longlived assets in Brazil and India were reduced by accelerated depreciation that was triggered at the point of decision to cease manufacturing operations prior to the end of their estimated useful lives If in future quarters our economic or business projections were to change as a result of our plans or changes in the economic or business environment there was a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or there was a current expectation that a longlived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life we would undertake additional testing as appropriate which could result in an impairment of longlived assets In our Mobility segment goodwill of 102 million related to two investments was fully impaired during the second half of 2021 based on external market indicators evaluated for other business purposes Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credits estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date The adequacy of Ford Credits allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly Because credit losses can vary substantially over time estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain Changes in assumptions affect Ford Credit interest operating and other expenses on our consolidated income statements and the allowance for credit losses contained within Ford Credit finance receivables net on our consolidated balance sheets See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses Nature of Estimates Required Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for receivables that share similar risk characteristics based on a collective assessment using a combination of measurement models and management judgment The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses recent portfolio performance and forwardlooking macroeconomic conditions The models vary by portfolio and receivable type including consumer finance receivables wholesale loans and dealer loans If Ford Credit does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty observable changes in portfolio performance and other relevant factors 89 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Assumptions Used Ford Credits allowance for credit losses is based on its assumptions regarding Probability of default The expected probability of payment and time to default which include assumptions about macroeconomic factors and recent performance and Loss given default The percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable The loss given default takes into account expected collateral value and future recoveries Macroeconomic factors used in Ford Credits models are country specific and include variables such as unemployment rates housing prices and gross domestic product Sensitivity Analysis Changes in the probability of default and loss given default assumptions would affect the allowance for credit losses The effect of the indicated increasedecrease in the assumptions for Ford Credits US Ford and Lincoln retail financing is as follows in millions Assumption Basis Point Change IncreaseDecrease Probability of default lifetime 100 bps 200200 Loss given default 100 1010 Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term Ford Credit monitors residual values each month and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credits revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term Adjustments to depreciation expense result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straightline basis Each lease customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer Nature of Estimates Required Each operating lease in Ford Credits portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values return volumes for its leased vehicles industrywide used vehicle prices marketing incentive plans and vehicle quality data Assumptions Used Ford Credits accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding Auction value Ford Credits projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease and Return volume Ford Credits projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at leaseend See Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases 90 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Sensitivity Analysis For returned vehicles Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases A change in the assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credits estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract The effect of the indicated increasedecrease in the assumptions for Ford Credits US Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows in millions Assumption Basis Point Change IncreaseDecrease Future auction values 100 bps 2020 Return volumes 100 55 Adjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases are reflected on our balance sheets as Net investment in operating leases and on our income statements in Ford Credit interest operating and other expenses 91 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB has issued the following Accounting Standards Updates ASU

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates as well as risks to availability of funding sources hazard events and specific asset risks These risks affect our Automotive and Ford Credit segments differently We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program which includes regular reports to a central management committee the Global Risk Management Committee GRMC The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and the committee includes our Controller and Treasurer Our Automotive and Ford Credit segments are exposed to liquidity risk including the possibility of having to curtail business or being unable to meet financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable Our plan is to maintain funding sources to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles As discussed in greater detail in Item 7 our funding sources include sales of receivables in securitizations and other structured financings unsecured debt issuances equity and equitylinked issuances and bank borrowings We are exposed to a variety of risks such as loss or damage to property liability claims and employee injury We protect against these risks through the purchase of commercial insurance that is designed to protect us above our selfinsured retentions against events that could generate significant losses Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written policies and procedures Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades the transaction of derivatives and the settlement of cash flows Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective In addition our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are approved by the GRMC and reviewed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors In accordance with our corporate risk management policies we use derivative instruments when available such as forward contracts swaps and options that economically hedge certain exposures foreign currency commodity and interest rates We do not use derivative contracts for trading marketmaking or speculative purposes In certain instances we forgo hedge accounting and in certain other instances our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting Either situation results in unrealized gains and losses that are recognized in income For additional information on our derivatives see Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive and Ford Credit segments are discussed and quantified below AUTOMOTIVE MARKET RISK Our Automotive segment frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies including the following purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts debt and other payables subsidiary dividends and investments in foreign operations These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in the production of our vehicles and changes in interest rates Foreign currency risk commodity risk and interest rate risk are measured and quantified using a model to evaluate the sensitivity of market value to instantaneous parallel shifts in rates andor prices Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in currency exchange rates Accordingly our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge our economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenues and costs assets liabilities and firm commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies consistent with our overall risk management strategy In our hedging actions we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk eg forward contracts 93 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Continued The net fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts including adjustments for credit risk as of December 31 2021 was a liability of 253 million compared with a liability of 487 million as of December 31 2020 The potential change in the fair value from a 10 change in the underlying exchange rates in US dollar terms would have been 22 billion at December 31 2021 compared with 25 billion at December 31 2020 The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes foreign exchange rate changes are instantaneous and adverse across all currencies In reality some of our exposures offset and foreign exchange rates move in different magnitudes and at different times and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure See Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contracts Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in the prices of commodities used in the production of motor vehicles such as base metals eg steel copper and aluminum precious metals eg palladium energy eg natural gas and electricity and plasticsresins eg polypropylene As we transition to a greater mix of battery electric vehicles we expect to increase our reliance on lithium cobalt and nickel for batteries Accordingly our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we can economically hedge primarily base metals and precious metals and consistent with our overall risk management strategy In our hedging actions we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk eg financially settled forward contracts The extent to which we hedge is also impacted by our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting The net fair value of commodity forward contracts including adjustments for credit risk as of December 31 2021 was an asset of 220 million compared with an asset of 105 million as of December 31 2020 The potential change in the fair value from a 10 change in the underlying commodity prices would be 215 million at December 31 2021 compared with 141 million at December 31 2020 The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes commodity price changes are instantaneous and adverse across all commodities In reality commodity prices move in different magnitudes and at different times and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure In addition our purchasing organization with guidance from the GRMC as appropriate negotiates contracts for the continuous supply of raw materials In some cases these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific prices and therefore play a role in managing commodity price risk Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our Company cash investment portfolios due to a change in interest rates Our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolios includes cash and cash equivalents and net marketable securities At December 31 2021 Company cash consisted of 106 billion of Rivian marketable securities and 260 billion of cash in our investment portfolios compared to 308 billion of Company cash at December 31 2020 We invest the portfolios in securities of various types and maturities the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity minimize risk and earn a reasonable return on the shortterm investments In investing the cash in our investment portfolios safety of principal is the primary objective and riskadjusted return is the secondary objective At any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolios Assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point the value of our portfolios would be reduced by 250 million as calculated as of December 31 2021 This compares to 250 million as calculated as of December 31 2020 While these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario actual results could differ from those projected The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve In reality interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel 94 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Continued FORD CREDIT MARKET RISK Market risk for Ford Credit is the possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates will adversely affect cash flow and economic value Interest Rate Risk Generally Ford Credits assets and the related debt have different repricing periods and consequently respond differently to changes in interest rates Ford Credits assets consist primarily of fixedrate retail financing and operating lease contracts and floatingrate wholesale receivables Fixedrate retail financing and operating lease contracts generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract Wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicles held in dealers inventory and generally require dealers to pay a floating rate Debt consists primarily of short and longterm unsecured and securitized debt Ford Credits term debt instruments are principally fixedrate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows and volatility in its economic value from changes in interest rates based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market Ford Credit uses economic value sensitivity analysis and repricing gap analysis to evaluate potential longterm effects of changes in interest rates It then enters into interest rate swaps to convert portions of its floatingrate debt to fixed or its fixedrate debt to floating to ensure that Ford Credits exposure falls within the established tolerances Ford Credit also uses pretax cash flow sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of nearterm cash flow exposure The pretax cash flow sensitivity analysis measures the changes in expected cash flows associated with Ford Credits interestratesensitive assets liabilities and derivative financial instruments from hypothetical changes in interest rates over a twelvemonth horizon Interest rate swaps are placed to maintain exposure within approved thresholds and the AssetLiability Committee reviews the repricing mismatch monthly To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pretax cash flow to changes in interest rates Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rates across all maturities a parallel shift as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at existing levels In reality interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in Ford Credits analysis As a result the actual impact to pretax cash flow could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent Ford Credits view of future interest rate movements Under these interest rate scenarios Ford Credit expects more debt and liabilities than assets to reprice in the next twelve months Other things being equal this means that during a period of rising interest rates the interest received on Ford Credits assets will increase less than the interest paid on Ford Credits debt thereby initially decreasing Ford Credits pretax cash flow During a period of falling interest rates Ford Credit would expect its pretax cash flow to initially increase Ford Credits pretax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement is highlighted in the table below Pretax cash flow sensitivity at December 31 was as follows in millions PreTax Cash Flow Sensitivity 2020 2021 One percentage point instantaneous increase in interest rates 3 76 One percentage point instantaneous decrease in interest rates a 3 76 __________ a Pretax cash flow sensitivity given a one percentage point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in markets where existing interest rates are below one percent While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of the specified assumed interest rate scenarios its actual results could differ from those projected The model Ford Credit uses to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions Embedded in the model are assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivatives exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives and predicted repayment of retail financing and operating lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity Ford Credits repayment projections ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience If interest rates or other factors change Ford Credits actual prepayment experience could be different than projected 95 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Continued Foreign Currency Risk Ford Credits policy is to minimize exposure to changes in currency exchange rates To meet funding objectives Ford Credit borrows in a variety of currencies principally US dollars Canadian dollars euros sterling and renminbi Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables When possible receivables are funded with debt in the same currency minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements When a different currency is used Ford Credit may use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables As a result of this policy Ford Credit believes its market risk exposure relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31 2021 is insignificant Derivative Fair Values The net fair value of Ford Credits derivative financial instruments was an asset of 553 million and 21 billion at December 31 2021 and 2020 respectively TRANSITION FROM LIBOR TO ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE RATES We and our affiliates including Ford Credit have been working to transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR to alternative reference rates We have developed a total company inventory of affected financial instruments and contracts have been working to transition legacy contracts linked to LIBOR to alternative reference rates and are no longer utilizing LIBOR for new contracts COUNTERPARTY RISK Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract We enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to manage this risk Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risk We together with Ford Credit establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forwardlooking and proactive allowing us to take risk mitigation actions before risks become losses Exposure limits are established based on our overall risk tolerance which is calculated from counterparty credit ratings and marketbased credit default swap CDS spreads The exposure limits are lower for smaller and lowerrated counterparties counterparties that have relatively higher CDS spreads and for longer dated exposures Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and included in periodic reports to our Treasurer Substantially all of our counterparty exposures are with counterparties that have an investment grade rating Investment grade is our guideline for minimum counterparty longterm ratings ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm our

Directors and Stockholders of Ford Motor Company Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ford Motor Company and its subsidiaries the Company as of December 31 2021 and 2020 and the related consolidated statements of income of comprehensive income of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2021 including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15a2 collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO In our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Company as of December 31 2021 and 2020 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America Also in our opinion the Company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the COSO Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses in 2020 Basis for Opinions The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks Such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions 106 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that i relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and ii involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matters below providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate Ford Credit Consumer Finance Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements the Company had consumer finance receivables of 73446 million for which a consumer allowance for credit losses of 903 million was recorded as of December 31 2021 The consumer allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the consumer finance receivables as of the balance sheet date For consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics management estimates the lifetime expected credit losses based on a collective assessment using measurement models and management judgment The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumptions to monthly expected exposures then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivables original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable If management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty observable changes in portfolio performance and other relevant factors The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Ford Credit consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are i the significant judgment by management in determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses ii a high degree of auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the probability of default and loss given default assumptions and managements judgment regarding qualitative factors and iii the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Companys determination of the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses These procedures also included among others i testing managements process for determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses ii evaluating the appropriateness of the models used to determine the allowance iii evaluating the reasonableness of the probability of default and loss given default assumptions iv testing the data used in the models and v evaluating the reasonableness of managements judgment regarding qualitative factors related to economic uncertainty observable changes in portfolio performance and other relevant factors Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in performing the procedures described in i through v 107 Warranty and Field Service Actions Accrual United States As described in Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements the Company had an accrual for estimated future warranty and field service action costs net of estimated supplier recoveries warranty accrual of 8451 million as of December 31 2021 of which the United States comprises a significant portion Management accrues the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale Management establishes their estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model using historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year Management establishes their estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model using historical information regarding the nature frequency severity and average cost of claims for each model year Management reevaluates the adequacy of their accruals on a regular basis The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the warranty accrual for the United States is a critical audit matter are i the significant judgment by management in the estimation of the accrual and development of the patterned estimation model ii a high degree of auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the estimation model and significant assumptions related to the frequency and average cost of claims and iii the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to the estimate of the warranty accrual for the United States These procedures also included among others evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management to develop the warranty accrual for the United States related to the frequency and average cost of claims in part by considering the historical experience of the Company Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the model as well as the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the frequency and average cost of claims s PricewaterhouseCoopers

which we are the primary beneficiary unless the context requires otherwise We also make reference to Ford Motor Credit Company LLC herein referenced to as Ford Credit Our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP We reclassified certain prior year amounts in our consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation Certain Transactions Between Automotive Mobility and Ford Credit Intersegment transactions occur in the ordinary course of business Additional detail regarding certain transactions and the effect on each segment at December 31 was as follows in billions 2020 2021 Automotive Mobility Ford Credit Automotive Mobility Ford Credit Trade and other receivables a 59 74

vehicles that we lease to our employees 114 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES For each accounting topic that is addressed in its own note the description of the accounting policy may be found in the related note Other significant accounting policies are described below Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results Estimates are used to account for certain items such as marketing accruals warranty costs employee benefit programs allowance for credit losses and other items requiring judgment Estimates are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates actual results may differ Foreign Currency When an entity has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from its functional currency we remeasure those assets and liabilities from the transactional currency to the entitys functional currency The effect of this remeasurement process and the results of our related foreign currency hedging activities are reported in Cost of sales and Other incomeloss net and were 58 million 46 million and 74 million for the years ended 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively Generally our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to US dollars using endofperiod exchange rates Changes in the carrying value of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates are recognized in Foreign currency translation a component of Other comprehensive incomeIoss net of tax Upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary the amount of accumulated foreign currency translation related to the entity is reclassified to income and recognized as part of the gain or loss on the investment Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate quoted price or penalty on withdrawal A debt security is classified as a cash equivalent if it meets these criteria and if it has a remaining time to maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase Amounts on deposit and available upon demand or negotiated to provide for daily liquidity without penalty are classified as Cash and cash equivalents Time deposits certificates of deposit and money market accounts that meet the above criteria are reported at par value on our consolidated balance sheets Restricted Cash Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements are recorded in Other assets in the noncurrent assets section of our consolidated balance sheets Our Company excluding Ford Credit restricted cash balances primarily include various escrow agreements related to legal insurance customs and environmental matters and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements Our Ford Credit segment restricted cash balances primarily include cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements Restricted cash does not include required minimum balances or cash securing debt issued through securitization transactions 115 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued Marketable Securities Investments in debt securities with a maturity date greater than three months at the date of purchase and other debt securities for which there is more than an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate quoted price or penalty on withdrawal are classified and accounted for as either trading or availableforsale marketable securities Equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are classified and accounted for as trading marketable securities Realized gains and losses interest income and dividend income on all of our marketable securities and unrealized gains and losses on securities not classified as available for sale are recorded in Other incomeloss net Unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities are recognized in Unrealized gains and losses on securities a component of Other comprehensive incomeloss net of tax Realized gains and losses and reclassifications of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income are measured using the specific identification method On a quarterly basis we review our availableforsale debt securities for credit losses We compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security we determine if a credit loss allowance is necessary If a credit loss allowance is necessary we will record an allowance limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis and recognize the corresponding charge in Other incomeloss net Factors we consider include the severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value interest rate changes and counterparty longterm ratings Trade Receivables Trade and other receivables consist primarily of Company excluding Ford Credit receivables from contracts with customers for the sale of vehicles parts accessories and services Trade receivables initially are recorded at the transaction amount and are typically outstanding for 30 days or less Each reporting period we evaluate the collectibility of the receivables and record an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our estimate of the expected losses that result from possible default events over the expected life of a receivable Changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by recording charges to bad debt expense reported in Selling administrative and other expenses Net Intangible Assets and Goodwill Indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired Goodwill impairment testing is also performed following an allocation of goodwill to a business to be disposed or a change in reporting units We test for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset or the reporting unit allocated the goodwill is less than its carrying amount If the qualitative assessment indicates a possible impairment the carrying value of the asset or reporting unit is compared with its fair value Fair value is measured relying primarily on the income approach by applying a discounted cash flow method the market approach using market values or multiples andor thirdparty valuations We capitalize and amortize our finitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives The carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill is reported in Other assets in the noncurrent assets section of our consolidated balance sheets Intangible assets are comprised primarily of advertising agreements land rights and technology licenses The net carrying amount of our intangible assets was 144 million and 111 million at December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively For the periods presented we have not recorded any material impairments for indefinitelived intangibles The net carrying amount of goodwill was 258 million and 619 million at December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively The goodwill increase from December 31 2020 primarily reflects the acquisitions of Getrag Ford Transmissions GmbH in March 2021 and Electriphi Inc in June 2021 see Note 22 offset partially by the full impairment of goodwill for two investments in our Mobility segment 116 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued HeldandUsed LongLived Asset Impairment We test longlived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses significant negative industry or economic trends a current expectation that a longlived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition or when there is a change in the asset grouping When a triggering event occurs a test for recoverability is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment the asset groups fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method To the extent available we will also consider thirdparty valuations of our longlived assets that were prepared for other business purposes An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life For the periods presented we have not recorded any impairments HeldforSale Asset Impairment We perform an impairment test on a disposal group to be discontinued held for sale HFS or otherwise disposed when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be completed within one year We estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received less cost to sell and compare it to the carrying value of the disposal group An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value see Note 22 We also assess fair value if circumstances arise that were considered unlikely and as a result we decide not to sell a disposal group previously classified as HFS upon reclassification as held and used When there is a change to a plan of sale and the assets are reclassified from HFS to held and used the longlived assets would be reported at the lower of i the carrying amount before HFS designation adjusted for depreciation that would have been recognized if the assets had not been classified as HFS or ii the fair value at the date the assets no longer satisfy the criteria for classification as HFS Fair Value Measurements We measure fair value of our financial instruments including those held within our pension plans using various valuation methods and prioritize the use of observable inputs The use of observable and unobservable inputs and their significance in measuring fair value are reflected in our fair value hierarchy Level 1 inputs include quoted prices for identical instruments and are the most observable Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments and observable inputs such as interest rates currency exchange rates and yield curves Level 3 inputs include data not observable in the market and reflect management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the instruments Fixed income securities equities commingled funds derivative financial instruments and alternative assets are remeasured and presented within our consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis Finance receivables and debt are measured at fair value for the purpose of disclosure Other assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis Transfers into and transfers out of the hierarchy levels are recognized as if they had taken place at the end of the reporting period 117 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued Valuation Method Fixed Income Securities Fixed income securities primarily include government securities government agency securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities We generally measure fair value using prices obtained from pricing services or quotes from dealers that make markets in such securities Pricing methods and inputs to valuation models used by the pricing services depend on the security type ie asset class Where possible fair values are generated using market inputs including quoted prices the closing price in an exchange market bid prices the price at which a buyer stands ready to purchase and other market information For fixed income securities that are not actively traded the pricing services use alternative methods to determine fair value for the securities including quotes for similar fixed income securities matrix pricing discounted cash flow using benchmark curves or other factors In certain cases when market data are not available we may use broker quotes or pricing services that use proprietary pricing models to determine fair value The proprietary models incorporate unobservable inputs primarily consisting of prepayment curves discount rates default assumptions recovery rates yield assumptions and credit spread assumptions An annual review is performed on the security prices received from our pricing services which includes discussion and analysis of the inputs used by the pricing services to value our securities We also compare the price of certain securities sold close to the quarter end to the price of the same security at the balance sheet date to ensure the reported fair value is reasonable Equities Equity securities are primarily exchangetraded and are valued based on the closing bid official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange If closing prices are not available securities are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price Securities that are thinly traded or delisted are valued using unobservable pricing data Commingled Funds Fixed income and public equity securities may each be combined into commingled fund investments Most commingled funds are valued to reflect our interest in the fund based on the reported yearend net asset value NAV Derivative Financial Instruments Exchangetraded derivatives for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded Overthecounter derivatives are not exchange traded and are valued using independent pricing services or industrystandard valuation models such as a discounted cash flow When discounted cash flow models are used projected future cash flows are discounted to a present value using marketbased expectations for interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and the contractual terms of the derivative instruments The discount rate used is the relevant benchmark interest rate eg LIBOR SONIA plus an adjustment for nonperformance risk The adjustment reflects the full credit default swap CDS spread applied to a net exposure by counterparty considering the master netting agreements and any posted collateral We use our counterpartys CDS spread when we are in a net asset position and our own CDS spread when we are in a net liability position In cases when market data are not available we use broker quotes and models eg BlackScholes to determine fair value This includes situations where there is a lack of liquidity for a particular currency or commodity or when the instrument is longer dated When broker quotes or models are used to determine fair value the derivative is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy All other derivatives are categorized within Level 2 Alternative Assets Hedge funds generally hold liquid and readilypriced securities such as public equities exchangetraded derivatives and corporate bonds Private equity and real estate investments are less liquid External investment managers typically report valuations reflecting initial cost or updated appraisals which are adjusted for cash flows and realized and unrealized gainslosses All alternative assets are valued at the NAV provided by the investment sponsor or third party administrator as they do not have readilyavailable market quotations Valuations may be lagged up to six months The NAV will be adjusted for cash flows additional investments or contributions and distributions through year end We may make further adjustments for any known substantive valuation changes not reflected in the NAV 118 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued We may hold annuity contracts within some of our nonUS pension plans see Note 17 Generally the contract valuation method is applied for markets where we have purchased nonparticipating annuity contracts from an insurer as a plan asset The FordWerke GmbH FordWerke defined benefit plan is primarily funded through a participating group insurance contract For the FordWerke plan we measure the fair value of the insurance asset by projecting expected future cash flows from the contract and discounting them to present value based on current market rates as well as an assessment for nonperformance risk of the insurance company The assumptions used to project expected future cash flows are based on actuarial estimates and are unobservable We include all annuity contracts within Level 3 of the hierarchy Finance Receivables We measure finance receivables at fair value using internal valuation models see Note 10 These models project future cash flows of financing contracts based on scheduled contract payments including principal and interest The projected cash flows are discounted to present value based on assumptions regarding expected credit losses prepayment speed and applicable spreads to approximate current rates The fair value of finance receivables is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy On a nonrecurring basis we also measure at fair value retail contracts greater than 120 days past due or deemed to be uncollectible and individual dealer loans probable of foreclosure We use the fair value of collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell to determine the fair value of these receivables The collateral for a retail financing or wholesale receivable is the vehicle financed and for dealer loans is real estate or other property The fair value of collateral for retail receivables is calculated as the outstanding receivable balances multiplied by the average recovery value percentage The fair value of collateral for wholesale receivables is based on the wholesale market value or liquidation value for new and used vehicles The fair value of collateral for dealer loans is determined by reviewing various appraisals which include total adjusted appraised value of land and improvements alternate use appraised value brokers opinion of value and purchase offers Debt We measure debt at fair value using quoted prices for our own debt with approximately the same remaining maturities see Note 19 Where quoted prices are not available we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows and marketbased expectations for interest rates credit risk and the contractual terms of the debt instruments For certain shortterm debt with an original maturity date of one year or less we assume that book value is a reasonable approximation of the debts fair value The fair value of debt is categorized within Level 2 of the hierarchy Finance and Lease Incentives We routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration when the vehicle is sold to the dealer Ford Credit records a reduction to the finance receivable or reduces the cost of the vehicle operating lease when it records the underlying finance contract and we transfer to Ford Credit the amount of the incentive on behalf of the dealers customer See Note 1 for additional information regarding transactions between Automotive and Ford Credit The Ford Credit segment recognized interest revenue of 25 billion 24 billion and 24 billion in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively and lower depreciation of 26 billion 23 billion and 19 billion in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively associated with these incentives Supplier Price Adjustments We frequently negotiate price adjustments with our suppliers throughout a production cycle even after receiving production material These price adjustments relate to changes in design specification or other commercial terms such as economics productivity and competitive pricing We recognize price adjustments when we reach final agreement with our suppliers In general we avoid direct price changes in consideration of future business however when these occur our policy is to defer the recognition of any such price change given explicitly in consideration of future business Government Incentives We receive incentives from US and nonUS governmental entities in the form of tax rebates or credits grants and loans Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense a reduction of the cost of the capital investment or other income The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met and there is reasonable assurance of receipt 119 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL

Update ASU 201912 Income Taxes Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes Effective January 1 2021 we adopted the amendments in this ASU to simplify the accounting for income taxes The amendments clarified that an entity may elect but is not required to reflect an allocation of consolidated current and deferred tax expense for nontaxable legal entities that are treated as disregarded by taxing authorities in their separately issued financial statements With the adoption of the amendments in ASU 201912 Ford Credits separately issued financial statements no longer reflect an allocation of our consolidated US current and deferred tax expense to it and certain of its US subsidiaries that are treated as disregarded entities for US tax purposes Adoption of these amendments reduces complexity in accounting for income taxes and better reflects Ford Credits external obligations to tax authorities Following the adoption in April 2021 we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Tax Sharing Agreement with Ford Credit The adoption of ASU 201912 and the Second Amended and Restated Tax Sharing Agreement had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations The amendments were adopted on a retrospective basis and are reflected in Ford Credits standalone financial statements and disclosures ASU 202006 Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity Effective January 1 2021 we adopted the new standard which simplified guidance on the issuers accounting for convertible debt instruments and amended certain guidance related to the computation of earnings per share for convertible instruments and contracts in an entitys own equity There was no impact on the date of adoption During the first quarter of 2021 we issued convertible notes see Note 19 Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs ASUs were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements 120 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 4 REVENUE The following tables disaggregate our

of a contract with our customer are satisfied generally this occurs when we transfer control of our vehicles parts or accessories or provide services Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services For the majority of sales this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities However we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or standready performance obligation such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity Sales valueadded and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenueproducing activities are excluded from revenue Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense The expected costs associated with our base warranties and field service actions are recognized as expense when the products are sold see Note 25 We do not have any material significant payment terms as payment is received at or shortly after the point of sale 121 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 4 REVENUE Continued Company Excluding Ford Credit Vehicles Parts and Accessories For the majority of vehicles parts and accessories we transfer control and recognize a sale when we ship the product from our manufacturing facility to our customer dealers and distributors We receive cash equal to the invoice price for most vehicle sales at the time of wholesale When the vehicle sale is financed by our whollyowned subsidiary Ford Credit the dealer is obligated to pay Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to the retail customer see Note 10 Payment terms on part sales to dealers distributors and retailers range from 30 to 120 days The amount of consideration we receive and revenue we recognize varies with changes in return rights and marketing incentives we offer to our customers and their customers When we give our dealers the right to return eligible parts and accessories we estimate the expected returns based on an analysis of historical experience Estimates of marketing incentives are based on expected retail and fleet sales volumes mix of products to be sold and incentive programs to be offered Customer acceptance of products and programs as well as other market conditions will impact these estimates We adjust our estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the value of consideration we expect to receive changes or when the consideration becomes fixed As a result of changes in our estimate of marketing incentives we recorded a decrease in revenue of 844 million and 973 million during 2019 and 2020 respectively and an increase in revenue of 252 million during 2021 related to revenue recognized in prior annual periods We have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in Cost of sales We sell vehicles to daily rental companies and may guarantee that we will pay them the difference between an agreed amount and the value they are able to realize upon resale At the time of transfer of vehicles to the daily rental companies we record the probable amount we will pay under the guarantee to Other liabilities and deferred revenue see Note 25 Used Vehicles We sell used vehicles both at auction and through our consolidated dealerships Proceeds from the sale of these vehicles are recognized in Company excluding Ford Credit revenues upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Cost of sales Services and other revenue We use an observable price to determine the standalone selling price for separate or standready performance obligations that are included as part of the vehicle consideration received eg free extended service contracts vehicle connectivity overtheair updates or a costplus margin approach when one is not available We also sell separately priced service contracts that extend mechanical and maintenance coverages beyond our base warranty agreements to vehicle owners We receive payment at contract inception and the contracts range from 12 to 120 months We recognize revenue for vehicle service contracts that extend mechanical and maintenance coverages beyond our base warranties over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations Revenue related to other future or standready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed At December 31 2019 and 2020 a balance of 42 billion of unearned revenue associated primarily with outstanding extended service contracts was reported in Other liabilities and deferred revenue We recognized 12 billion and 13 billion of the unearned amounts as revenue during the years ended December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively At December 31 2021 the unearned amount was 43 billion We expect to recognize approximately 13 billion of the unearned amount in 2022 11 billion in 2023 and 19 billion thereafter We record a premium deficiency reserve to the extent we estimate the future costs associated with extended service contracts exceed the unrecognized revenue Amounts paid to dealers to obtain these contracts are deferred and recorded as Other assets These costs are amortized to expense consistent with how the related revenue is recognized We had a balance of 283 million and 309 million in deferred costs as of December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively We recognized 74 million 79 million and 81 million of amortization during the years ended December 31 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively 122 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 4 REVENUE Continued We also receive net commissions for serving as the agent in facilitating the sale of a third partys products or services to our customers payments for vehiclerelated design and testing services we perform for others and revenue associated with various Mobility operations We have applied the practical expedient to recognize Automotive revenues for vehiclerelated design and testing services over the two to three year term of these agreements in proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice Leasing Income We sell vehicles to daily rental companies with an obligation to repurchase the vehicles for a guaranteed amount exercisable at the option of the customer The transactions are accounted for as operating leases Upon the transfer of vehicles to the daily rental companies we record proceeds received in Other liabilities and deferred revenue The difference between the proceeds received and the guaranteed repurchase amount is recorded in Company excluding Ford Credit revenues over the term of the lease using a straightline method The cost of the vehicle is recorded in Net investment in operating leases on our consolidated balance sheets and the difference between the cost of the vehicle and the estimated auction value is depreciated in Cost of sales over the term of the lease Ford Credit Segment Leasing Income Ford Credit offers leasing plans to retail consumers through Ford and Lincoln brand dealers that originate the leases Ford Credit records an operating lease upon purchase of a vehicle subject to a lease from the dealer The retail consumer makes lease payments representing the difference between Ford Credits purchase price of the vehicle and the contractual residual value of the vehicle plus lease fees which we recognize on a straightline basis over the term of the lease agreement Depreciation and the gain or loss upon disposition of the vehicle is recorded in Ford Credit interest operating and other expenses Financing Income Ford Credit originates and purchases finance installment contracts Financing income represents interest earned on the finance receivables including salestype and direct financing leases Interest is recognized using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain direct origination costs Insurance Income Income from insurance contracts is recognized evenly over the term of the agreement Insurance commission revenue is recognized on a net basis at the time of sale of the third partys

stock units RSUs restricted stock shares RSSs and stock options RSUs and RSSs consist of timebased and performancebased awards The number of shares that may be granted in any year is limited to 2 of our issued and outstanding Common Stock as of December 31 of the prior calendar year The limit may be increased up to 3 in any year with a corresponding reduction in shares available for grants in future years Granted RSUs generally cliff vest or ratably vest over a threeyear service period Performancebased RSUs have two components one based on internal financial performance metrics and the other based on total shareholder return relative to an industrial and automotive peer group At the time of vest RSU awards are net settled ie shares are withheld to cover the employee tax obligation Stock options ratably vest over a threeyear service period and expire ten years from the grant date The fair value of both the timebased and the internal performance metrics portion of the performancebased RSUs and RSSs is determined using the closing price of our Common Stock at grant date For awards that include a market condition we measure the fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation The weighted average per unit grant date fair value for the years ended December 31 2019 2020 and 2021 was 899 711 and 1302 respectively Timebased RSUs generally have a graded vesting feature whereby onethird of each grant vests after the first anniversary of the grant date onethird after the second anniversary and onethird after the third anniversary The graded vesting method recognizes expense over the service period for each separatelyvesting tranche which results in accelerated recognition of expense The fair value of timebased RSUs RSSs and stock options is expensed over the shorter of each separate vesting period using the graded vesting method or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement The fair value of performancebased RSUs and RSSs is expensed when it is probable and estimable as measured against the performance metrics over the shorter of the performance or required service periods We measure the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using either the BlackScholes optionpricing model for options without a market condition or a Monte Carlo simulation for options with a market condition We have elected to recognize forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense for all RSUs RSSs and stock options in the same period as the forfeitures occur Expense is recorded in Selling administrative

equivalent of about 197 million in new issues used to settle the exercised options For options exercised during the year ended December 31 2021 the difference between the fair value of the Common Stock issued and the respective exercise price was 64 million As of December 31 2021 the intrinsic value for vested and unvested stock options was 516 million and 632 million respectively The average remaining terms for fully vested stock options and unvested stock options were 23 years and 85 years respectively Compensation cost for stock options for the year ended December 31 2021 was 2 million

are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns and their future probability In assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets If based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized we record a valuation allowance 125 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 7 INCOME TAXES Continued Components of Income Taxes Components of income taxes excluding cumulative

and Jobs Act HR 1 was signed into law This act includes among other items a permanent reduction to the US corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective January 1 2018 and requires immediate taxation of accumulated unremitted nonUS earnings For the year ended December 31 2019 our tax provision includes additional expense of 95 million related to the impact of the act and subsequently issued Treasury regulations on our global operations During 2020 based on all available evidence we established US valuation allowances of 13 billion primarily against tax credits as it was deemed more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would not be realized In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider the tradeoffs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits In 2021 we reversed 918 million of the previously established US valuation allowances The reversal primarily reflects a change in our intent to pursue planning actions involving cash outlays to preserve tax credits At December 31 2021 167 billion of nonUS earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided Quantification of the deferred tax liability if any associated with indefinitely reinvested basis differences is not practicable 126 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE

returns During 2021 we restructured a significant portion of these operations resulting in recognition of 29 billion of net deferred tax assets Reversal of the remaining elections would result in the recognition of 43 billion of deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowance testing Operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes were 114 billion at December 31 2021 resulting in a deferred tax asset of 42 billion There is no expiration date for 32 billion of these losses A substantial portion of the remaining losses will expire beyond 2024 Tax credits available to offset future tax liabilities are 104 billion The majority of these credits have a remaining carryforward period of five years or more Tax benefits of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis including a review of historical and projected future operating results the eligible carryforward period and available tax planning strategies In our evaluation we anticipate making tax

Receivables Classification Finance receivables are accounted for as held for investment HFI if Ford Credit has the intent and ability to hold the receivables for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff The determination of intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future is highly judgmental and requires Ford Credit to make good faith estimates based on all information available at the time of origination or purchase If Ford Credit does not have the intent and ability to hold the receivables then the receivables are classified as HFS Each quarter Ford Credit makes a determination of whether it is probable that finance receivables originated or purchased during the quarter will be held for the foreseeable future based on historical receivables sale experience internal forecasts and budgets as well as other relevant reliable information available through the date of evaluation For purposes of this determination probable means at least 70 likely and consistent with the budgeting and forecasting period the foreseeable future means twelve months Ford Credit classifies receivables as HFI or HFS on a receivablebyreceivable basis Specific receivables

measures credit quality using information in the credit application proposed contract terms credit bureau data and other information After a proprietary risk score is generated Ford Credit decides whether to originate a contract using a decision process based on a judgmental evaluation of the applicant the credit application the proposed contract terms credit bureau information eg FICO score proprietary risk score and other information The evaluation emphasizes the applicants ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment affordability applicant credit history and stability as key considerations After origination Ford Credit reviews the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity As each customer develops a payment history an internally developed behavioral scoring model is used to assist in determining the best collection strategies which allows Ford Credit to focus collection activity on higherrisk accounts These models are used to refine Ford Credits riskbased staffing model to ensure collection resources are aligned with portfolio risk Based on data from this scoring model contracts are categorized by collection risk Ford Credits collection models evaluate several factors including origination characteristics updated credit bureau data and payment patterns Credit quality ratings for consumer receivables are based on aging Consumer receivables credit quality ratings are as follows Pass current to 60 days past due Special Mention 61 to 120 days past due and in intensified collection status and Substandard greater than

credit to purchase new Ford and Lincoln vehicles as well as used vehicles Payment is required when the dealer has sold the vehicle Each nonconsumer lending request is evaluated by considering the borrowers financial condition and the underlying collateral securing the loan Ford Credit uses a proprietary model to assign each dealer a risk rating This model uses historical dealer performance data to identify key factors about a dealer that are considered most significant in predicting a dealers ability to meet its financial obligations Ford Credit also considers numerous other financial and qualitative factors of the dealers operations including capitalization and leverage liquidity and cash flow profitability and credit history with Ford Credit and other creditors Dealers are assigned to one of four groups according to risk ratings as follows Group I strong to superior financial metrics Group II fair to favorable financial metrics Group III marginal to weak financial metrics and Group IV poor financial metrics including dealers classified as uncollectible Ford Credit generally suspends credit lines and extends no further funding to dealers classified in Group IV Ford Credit regularly reviews the model to confirm the continued business significance and statistical predictability of the model and may make updates to improve the performance of the model In addition Ford Credit regularly audits dealer inventory and dealer sales records to verify that the dealer is in possession of the financed vehicles and is promptly paying each receivable following the sale of the financed vehicle The frequency of onsite vehicle inventory audits depends primarily on the dealers risk rating Under Ford Credits policies onsite vehicle inventory audits of lowrisk dealers are conducted only as circumstances warrant Onsite vehicle inventory audits of higherrisk dealers are conducted with increased frequency based primarily on the dealers risk rating but also considering the results of electronic monitoring of the dealers performance including daily payment verifications and monthly analyses of the dealers financial statements payoffs aged inventory over credit line and delinquency reports Ford Credit typically performs a credit review of each dealer annually and more frequently reviews certain dealers based on the dealers risk rating and total exposure Ford Credit adjusts the dealers risk rating if necessary 136 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 10 FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR

on the principal balance of the receivables If a receivable is modified in a reorganization proceeding all payment requirements of the reorganization plan need to be met before remaining balances are forgiven 137 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 10 FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES Continued Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges to Ford Credit interest operating and other expenses on our consolidated income statements The uncollectible portion of a finance receivable is charged to the allowance for credit losses at the earlier of when an account is deemed to be uncollectible or when an account is 120 days delinquent taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer or borrower the value of the collateral recourse to guarantors and other factors Chargeoffs on finance receivables include uncollected amounts related to principal interest late fees and other allowable charges Recoveries on finance receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance for credit losses In the event Ford Credit repossesses the collateral the receivable is charged off and the collateral is recorded at its estimated fair value less costs to sell and reported in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets Consumer Portfolio For consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics such as product type initial credit risk term vintage geography and other relevant factors Ford Credit estimates the lifetime expected credit loss allowance based on a collective assessment using measurement models and management judgment The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumption models to monthly expected exposures then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivables original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable Probability of default models are developed from internal risk scoring models taking into account the expected probability of payment and time to default adjusted for macroeconomic outlook and recent performance The models consider factors such as risk evaluation at the time of origination historical trends in credit losses which include the impact of TDRs and the composition and recent performance of the present portfolio including vehicle brand term risk evaluation and newused vehicles The loss given default is the percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable taking into account the expected collateral value and trends in recoveries including key metrics such as delinquencies repossessions and bankruptcies Monthly exposures are equal to the receivables expected outstanding principal and interest balance The allowance for credit losses incorporates forwardlooking macroeconomic conditions for baseline upturn and downturn scenarios Three separate credit loss allowances are calculated from these scenarios They are then probabilityweighted to determine the quantitative estimate of the credit loss allowance recognized in the financial statements Ford Credit uses forecasts from a third party that revert to a longterm historical average after a reasonable and supportable forecasting period which is specific to the particular macroeconomic variable and which varies by market Ford Credit updates the forwardlooking macroeconomic forecasts quarterly If management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty observable changes in portfolio performance and other relevant factors On an ongoing basis Ford Credit reviews its models including macroeconomic factors the selection of macroeconomic scenarios and their weighting to ensure they reflect the risk of the portfolio 138 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 10 FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES Continued NonConsumer Portfolio Dealer financing is evaluated on an individual dealer basis by segmenting dealers by risk characteristics such as the amount of the loans the nature of the collateral the financial status of the dealer and any TDR modifications to determine if an individual dealer requires a specific allowance for credit loss If required the allowance is based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the dealers receivables discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell For the remaining dealer financing Ford Credit estimates an allowance for credit losses on a collective basis Wholesale Loans Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans based on historical losstoreceivable LTR ratios expected future cash flows and the fair value of collateral For wholesale loans with similar risk characteristics the allowance for credit losses is estimated on a collective basis using the LTR model and management judgment The LTR model is based on the most recent years of history An LTR ratio is calculated by dividing credit losses ie chargeoffs net of recoveries by average net finance receivables excluding unearned interest supplements and allowance for credit losses The average LTR ratio is multiplied by the endofperiod balances representing the lifetime expected credit loss reserve Dealer Loans Ford Credit uses a weightedaverage remaining maturity method to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss reserve for dealer loans The loss model is based on the industrywide commercial real estate credit losses adjusted to factor in the historical credit losses for the dealer loans portfolio The expected credit loss is calculated under different macroeconomic scenarios that are weighted to provide the total lifetime expected credit loss After establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit losses if management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions or other relevant forwardlooking economic factors an adjustment is made based on management judgment 139 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 10

uncertainty attributable to the COVID19 pandemic including the negative impact to consumer liquidity once economic support programs end and the pandemics effect on the labor market and unemployment For the year ended December 31 2021 the allowance for credit losses decreased 380 million primarily reflecting improvement in the economic outlook that caused Ford Credit to lower its expectation of lifetime losses attributable to macroeconomic assumptions driven by COVID19 Although net chargeoffs for the year ended December 31 2021 remained low due in part to government support programs changes in consumer spending behavior and high vehicle auction values the impact of COVID19 on future credit losses remains uncertain Ford Credit will continue to monitor economic trends and conditions and

periodic benefit cost in the period of the remeasurement The impact of a retroactive plan amendment is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss and is amortized as a component of net periodic cost generally over the remaining service period of the active employees The service cost component is included in Cost of sales and Selling administrative and other expenses Other components of net periodic benefit costincome are included in Other incomeloss net on our consolidated income statements A curtailment results from an event that significantly reduces the expected years of future service or eliminates the accrual of defined benefits for the future services of a significant number of employees A curtailment gain is recorded when the employees who are entitled to a benefit terminate their employment or when a plan suspension or amendment that results in a curtailment gain is adopted A curtailment loss is recorded when it becomes probable a curtailment loss will occur We recognize settlement expense when the costs associated with all settlements during the year exceed the interest component of net periodic cost for the affected plan Expense from curtailments and settlements is recorded in Other incomeloss net Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering hourly and salaried employees in the United States Canada United Kingdom Germany and other locations The largest portion of our worldwide obligation is associated with our US plans Virtually all of our worldwide defined benefit plans are closed to new participants

expect to make about 390 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans Based on current assumptions and regulations we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major US

investment objectives for the US plans are to minimize the volatility of the value of our US pension assets relative to US pension obligations and to ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits Our largest nonUS plans eg United Kingdom and Canada have similar investment objectives to the US plans Investment strategies and policies for the US plans and the largest nonUS plans reflect a balance of riskreducing and returnseeking considerations The objective of minimizing the volatility of assets relative to obligations is addressed primarily through assetliability matching asset diversification and hedging The fixed income asset allocation matches the bondlike and longdated nature of the pension obligations Assets are broadly diversified within asset classes to achieve riskadjusted returns that in total lower asset volatility relative to the obligations Strategies to address the goal of ensuring sufficient assets to pay benefits include target allocations to a broad array of asset classes and strategies within asset classes that provide adequate returns diversification and liquidity 148 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 17 RETIREMENT BENEFITS Continued Derivatives are permitted for fixed income investment and public equity managers to use as efficient substitutes for traditional securities and to manage exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks Interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments are used for the purpose of hedging changes in the fair value of assets that result from interest rate changes and currency fluctuations Interest rate derivatives are also used to adjust portfolio duration Derivatives may not be used to leverage or to alter the economic exposure to an asset class outside the scope of the mandate an investment manager has been given Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage including through the use of derivatives or other tools that may alter economic exposure Alternative investments execute diverse strategies that provide exposure to a broad range of hedge fund strategies equity investments in private companies and investments in private property funds Significant Concentrations of Risk Significant concentrations of risk in our plan assets relate to interest rates growth assets and operating risks In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the obligations the majority of plan assets are allocated to fixed income investments which are exposed to interest rate risk Rate increases generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets while reducing the present value of the obligations Conversely rate decreases generally will increase the value of fixed income assets offsetting the related increase in the obligations In order to ensure assets are sufficient to pay benefits a portion of plan assets is allocated to growth assets primarily hedge funds real estate private equity and public equity that are expected over time to earn higher returns with more volatility than fixed income investments which more closely match pension obligations Within growth assets risk is mitigated by constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by asset class investment strategy manager style and process Operating risks include the risks of inadequate diversification and weak controls To mitigate these risks investments are diversified across and within asset classes in support of investment objectives Policies and practices to address operating risks include ongoing manager oversight eg style adherence team strength firm health and internal risk controls plan and asset class investment guidelines and instructions that are communicated to managers and periodic compliance reviews to ensure adherence At yearend 2021 Ford securities comprised less than 1 of our plan assets Expected LongTerm Rate of Return on Assets The longterm return assumption at yearend 2021 is 575 for the US plans 300 for the UK plans and 411 for the Canadian plans and averages 329 for all nonUS plans A generally consistent approach is used worldwide to develop this assumption This approach considers primarily inputs from a range of advisors for longterm capital market returns inflation bond yields and other variables adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan Historical returns also are considered where appropriate The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs with a focus on longterm trends to avoid shortterm market influences 149 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND

terminate the head lease We include options that we are reasonably certain to exercise in our evaluation of the lease term after considering all relevant economic and financial factors Leases that are economically similar to the purchase of an asset are classified as finance leases The leased rightofuse assets in finance lease arrangements are reported in Net property on our consolidated balance

separate the nonlease components eg maintenance and operating services from the lease components to which they relate Instead nonlease components are included in the measurement of the lease liabilities However we do separate lease and nonlease components for contracts containing a significant service component eg energy performance contracts We calculate the initial lease liability as the present value of fixed payments not yet paid and variable payments that are based on a market rate or an index eg CPI measured at commencement The majority of our leases are discounted using our incremental borrowing rate because the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable All other variable payments are expensed as incurred 152 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 24 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES A VIE is an entity that either i has insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or ii has equity investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest We consolidate VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary We consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE Assets recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets Liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional claims on our general assets rather they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated VIEs We have the power to direct the significant activities of an entity when our management has the ability to make key operating decisions such as decisions regarding capital investment or manufacturing production schedules For securitization entities we have the power to direct significant activities when we have the ability to exercise discretion in the servicing of financial assets issue additional debt exercise a unilateral call option add assets to revolving structures or control investment decisions VIEs of Which We are Not the Primary Beneficiary Certain of our affiliates are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary Our maximum exposure to any potential losses associated with these affiliates is limited to our affiliate investments and loans and was 3 billion and 28 billion at December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively VIEs of Which We are the Primary Beneficiary Securitization Entities Through Ford Credit we securitize transfer and service financial assets associated with consumer finance receivables operating leases and wholesale loans Our securitization transactions typically involve the legal transfer of financial assets to bankruptcy remote SPEs We generally retain a portion of the economic interests in the assetbacked securitization transactions which could be retained in the form of a portion of the senior interests the subordinated interests cash reserve accounts residual interests and servicing rights The transfers of assets in our securitization transactions do not qualify for accounting sale treatment In most cases the bankruptcy remote SPEs meet the definition of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary and therefore are consolidated We account for all securitization transactions as if they were secured financing and therefore the assets liabilities and related activity of these transactions are consolidated in our financial statements See Note 19 for additional information on the accounting for assetbacked debt and the assets securing this debt 169 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 25 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments and contingencies primarily consist of guarantees and indemnifications litigation and claims and warranty and field service actions Guarantees and Indemnifications Financial Guarantees Financial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception Subsequent to initial recognition the guarantee liability is adjusted at each reporting period to reflect the current estimate of expected payments resulting from possible default events over the remaining life of the guarantee The maximum potential payments for financial guarantees were 346 million and 357 million at December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively The carrying value of recorded liabilities related to financial guarantees was 46 million and 36 million at December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively Our financial guarantees consist of debt and lease obligations of certain joint ventures as well as certain financial obligations of outside third parties including suppliers to support our business and economic growth Expiration dates vary through 2033 and guarantees will terminate on payment andor cancellation of the underlying obligation A payment by us would be triggered by failure of the joint venture or other third party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee In some circumstances we are entitled to recover from a third party amounts paid by us under the guarantee NonFinancial Guarantees Nonfinancial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception We regularly review our performance risk under these arrangements and in the event it becomes probable we will be required to perform under a guarantee or indemnity the amount of probable payment is recorded The maximum potential payments for nonfinancial guarantees were 245 million and 453 million at December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively The carrying value of recorded liabilities related to nonfinancial guarantees was 48 million and 38 million at December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively We guarantee the resale value of vehicles sold in certain arrangements to daily rental companies The maximum potential payment of 446 million as of December 31 2021 represents the total proceeds we guarantee the rental company will receive on resale Reflecting our present estimate of proceeds the rental companies will receive on resale from third parties we have recorded 38 million as our best estimate of the amount we will have to pay under the guarantee In the ordinary course of business we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction such as the sale of a business These indemnifications might include and are not limited to claims relating to any of the following environmental tax and shareholder matters intellectual property rights power generation contracts governmental regulations and employmentrelated matters dealer supplier and other commercial contractual relationships and financial matters such as securitizations Performance under these indemnities generally would be triggered by a breach of contract claim brought by a counterparty including a joint venture or alliance partner or a thirdparty claim While some of these indemnifications are limited in nature many of them do not limit potential payment Therefore we are unable to estimate a maximum amount of future payments that could result from claims made under these unlimited indemnities 170 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 25 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Continued Litigation and Claims Various legal actions proceedings and claims generally matters are pending or may be instituted or asserted against us These include but are not limited to matters arising out of alleged defects in our products product warranties governmental regulations relating to safety emissions and fuel economy or other matters government incentives tax matters including trade and customs alleged illegal acts resulting in fines or penalties financial services employmentrelated matters dealer supplier and other contractual relationships intellectual property rights environmental matters shareholder or investor matters and financial reporting matters Certain of the pending legal actions are or purport to be class actions Some of the matters involve or may involve claims for compensatory punitive or antitrust or other treble damages in very large amounts or demands for field service actions environmental remediation programs sanctions loss of government incentives assessments or other relief which if granted would require very large expenditures The extent of our financial exposure to these matters is difficult to estimate Many matters do not specify a dollar amount for damages and many others specify only a jurisdictional minimum To the extent an amount is asserted our historical experience suggests that in most instances the amount asserted is not a reliable indicator of the ultimate outcome We accrue for matters when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature the specific facts and circumstances asserted the likelihood that we will prevail and the severity of any potential loss We reevaluate and update our accruals as matters progress over time For the majority of matters which generally arise out of alleged defects in our products we establish an accrual based on our extensive historical experience with similar matters We do not believe there is a reasonably possible outcome materially in excess of our accrual for these matters For the remaining matters where our historical experience with similar matters is of more limited value ie nonpattern matters we evaluate the matters primarily based on the individual facts and circumstances For nonpattern matters we evaluate whether there is a reasonable possibility of a material loss in excess of any accrual that can be estimated Our estimate of reasonably possible loss in excess of our accruals for all material matters currently reflects indirect tax and customs matters for which we estimate the aggregate risk to be a range of up to about 17 billion an increase of about 13 billion from December 31 2020 primarily reflecting an assessment received in 2021 in a customs matter As noted the litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance Our assessments are based on our knowledge and experience but the ultimate outcome of any matter could require payment substantially in excess of the amount that we have accrued andor disclosed 171 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 25 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Continued Warranty and Field Service Actions We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model using historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model using historical information regarding the nature frequency severity and average cost of claims for each model year In addition from time to time we issue extended warranties at our expense the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance Warranty and field service action obligations are reported in Other liabilities and deferred revenue We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis We recognize the benefit from a recovery of the costs associated with our warranty and field service actions when specifics of the recovery have been agreed with our supplier and the amount of recovery is virtually certain Recoveries are reported in Trade and other receivables net and Other assets The estimate of our future warranty and field service action costs net of estimated supplier recoveries for the years ended December 31 was as follows in millions 2020 2021 Beginning balance 5702 8172 Payments made during the period 3923 3952 Changes in accrual related to warranties issued during the period 3934 4102 Changes in accrual related to preexisting warranties 2403 221 Foreign currency translation and other 56 92 Ending balance 8172 8451 Changes to our estimated costs are reported as changes in accrual related to preexisting warranties in the table above Our estimate of reasonably possible costs in excess of our accruals for material field service actions and customer satisfaction actions is a range of up to about 1 billion in the aggregate 172 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 26 SEGMENT
