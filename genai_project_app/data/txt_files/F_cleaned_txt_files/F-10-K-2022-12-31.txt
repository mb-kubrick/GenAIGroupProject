new operating model and reporting structure With this change we will analyze the results of our business through the following reportable segments Ford Blue Ford Model e and Ford Pro combined replacing the Automotive segment Ford Next previously Mobility and Ford Credit As a result of the change beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10Q for the quarter ending March 31 2023 we will report our results in these five reportable segments Company adjusted EBIT will include the financial results of these five reportable segments and Corporate Other and net income will comprise the financial results of the five reportable segments and Corporate Other as well as Interest on Debt Special Items and Taxes Below is a description of our reportable segments and other activities as of December 31 2022 AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT The Automotive segment primarily includes the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles service parts and accessories worldwide together with the associated costs to develop manufacture distribute and service the vehicles parts and accessories This segment includes revenues and costs related to our electrification vehicle programs and enterprise connectivity The segment includes the following regional business units North America South America Europe China including Taiwan and the International Markets Group General Our vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln In 2022 we sold approximately 4231000 vehicles at wholesale throughout the world See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 7 for a discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volumes Substantially all of our vehicles parts and accessories are sold through distributors and dealers collectively dealerships the substantial majority of which are independently owned At December 31 the approximate number of dealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands was as follows Brand 2021 2022 Ford 8900 8596 FordLincoln combined 654 607 Lincoln 401 408 Total 9955 9611 We do not depend on any single customer or a few customers to the extent that the loss of such customers would have a material adverse effect on our business In addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale we also sell vehicles to our dealerships for sale to fleet customers including commercial fleet customers daily rental car companies and governments We also sell parts and accessories primarily to our dealerships which in turn sell these products to retail customers and to authorized parts distributors which in turn primarily sell these products to retailers We also offer extended service contracts The worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic and political conditions over which we have little control Vehicles are durable goods and consumers and businesses have latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing vehicle The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth geopolitical events and other factors including the cost of purchasing and operating cars trucks and utility vehicles and the availability and cost of financing and fuel As a result the number of cars trucks and utility vehicles sold may vary substantially from year to year Further the automotive industry is a highly competitive business that has a wide and growing variety of product and service offerings from a growing number of manufacturers 2 Item 1 Business Continued Our wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand Our wholesale unit volumes also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory and our ability to maintain sufficient production levels to support desired dealer inventory in the event of supplier disruptions or other types of disruptions affecting our production Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived by customers in comparison to those offered by other manufacturers based on many factors including price quality styling reliability safety fuel efficiency functionality and reputation Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions Our ability to satisfy changing consumer and business preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle as well as design and performance characteristics affects our sales and earnings significantly As with other manufacturers the profitability of our business is affected by many factors including Wholesale unit volumes Margin of profit on each vehicle sold which in turn is affected by many factors such as Market factors volume and mix of vehicles and options sold and net pricing reflecting among other factors incentive programs Costs of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles Costs for customer warranty claims and additional service actions Costs for safety emissions and fuel economy technology and equipment A high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can significantly affect overall profitability Although recent supply disruptions have resulted in nearterm upward pressure on new vehicle prices our industry has historically had a very competitive pricing environment driven in part by excess capacity For the past several decades manufacturers typically have offered price discounts and other marketing incentives to provide value for customers and maintain market share and production levels and we are beginning to see indications that some of these actions will resume in 2023 as industry production and inventories improve The decline in value of foreign currencies in the past has also contributed significantly to competitive pressures in many of our markets Competitive Position The worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers with no single dominant producer Certain manufacturers however account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries especially their countries of origin Seasonality We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors including retail sales ie units sold by our dealerships to their customers at retail and dealer stock levels ie the number of units held in inventory by our dealerships for sale to their customers Historically we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in the business with production in many markets tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer typically the strongest sales months of the year In recent years due to COVID19 the semiconductor shortage and other supply constraints production has been higher in the second half of the year Backlog Orders During the past year gross stock levels at dealers were lower than normal due largely to the semiconductor shortage and other supply constraints and the amount of time required to fill orders for certain vehicles increased Raw Materials We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in the production of and development of technologies in our vehicles These materials include base metals eg steel and aluminum precious metals eg palladium energy eg natural gas and plasticsresins eg polypropylene As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles we expect to increase our reliance on lithium cobalt nickel graphite and manganese among other materials for batteries We expect to have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs however there always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact availability in sufficient quantities and at cost effective prices to meet our needs See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks associated with a shortage of components or raw materials supplier disruptions and inflationary pressures the Key Trends and Economic Factors

patents trade secrets copyrights and trademarks on a global basis We expect to continue building this portfolio as we actively pursue innovation in every part of our business We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our Company and its products and services globally While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property agreement Warranty Coverage Field Service Actions and Customer Satisfaction Actions We provide warranties on vehicles we sell Warranties are offered for specific periods of time andor mileage and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale Pursuant to these warranties we will repair replace or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factorysupplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period In addition to the costs associated with this warranty coverage provided on our vehicles we also incur costs as a result of field service actions ie safety recalls emission recalls and other product campaigns and for customer satisfaction actions For additional information regarding warranty and related costs see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 and Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements Wholesales Wholesales consist primarily of vehicles sold to dealerships For the majority

Statements Effective January 1 2023 our Ford Next segment formerly Mobility primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in complementary market segments 5 Item 1 Business Continued FORD CREDIT SEGMENT The Ford Credit segment is comprised of the Ford Credit business on a consolidated basis which is primarily vehiclerelated financing and leasing activities Ford Credit offers a wide variety of automotive financing products to and through automotive dealers throughout the world The predominant share of Ford Credits business consists of financing our vehicles and supporting our dealers Ford Credit earns its revenue primarily from payments made under retail installment sale and finance lease retail financing and operating lease contracts that it originates and purchases interest rate supplements and other support payments from us and our affiliates and payments made under dealer financing programs As a result of these financing activities Ford Credit has a large portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases which it classifies into two portfolios consumer and nonconsumer Finance receivables and operating leases in the consumer portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of our vehicles from dealers for personal and commercial use Retail financing includes retail installment sale contracts for new and used vehicles and finance leases comprised of salestype and direct financing leases for new vehicles to retail and commercial customers including leasing companies government entities daily rental companies and fleet customers Finance receivables in the nonconsumer portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers Ford Credit makes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory also known as floorplan financing as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities finance the purchase of dealership real estate and finance other dealer vehicle programs Ford Credit also purchases receivables generated by us and our affiliates primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet companies Ford Credit also provides financing to us for vehicles that we lease to our employees The majority of Ford Credits business is in the United States and Canada Outside of the United States Europe is Ford Credits largest operation Ford Credits European operations are managed primarily through its United Kingdombased subsidiary FCE Bank plc FCE Within Europe Ford Credits largest markets are the United Kingdom and Germany See Item 7 and Notes 10 and 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of Ford Credits receivables credit losses allowance for credit losses losstoreceivables ratios funding sources and funding strategies See Item 7A for a discussion of how Ford Credit manages its financial market risks We routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealers customer These programs increase Ford Credits financing volume and share See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information about our accounting for these programs We have a Third Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement with Ford Credit pursuant to which if Ford Credits financial statement leverage for a calendar quarter were to be higher than 1251 as reported in its most recent periodic report Ford Credit could require us to make or cause to be made a capital contribution to it in an amount sufficient to have caused such financial statement leverage to have been 1251 No capital contributions have been made pursuant to this agreement In a separate agreement with FCE Ford Credit has agreed to maintain FCEs net worth in excess of 500 million No payments have been made pursuant to that agreement Ford Credit files periodic reports with the SEC that contain additional information regarding Ford Credit The reports are available through Ford Credits website located at wwwfordcreditcominvestorcenter and can also be found on the SECs website located at wwwsecgov The foregoing information regarding Ford Credits website

incomeexpense and related assets previously reported in the Automotive segment were realigned to Corporate Other INTEREST ON DEBT Interest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit GOVERNMENTAL STANDARDS Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety fuel economy emissions control noise control vehicle recycling substances of concern vehicle damage and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles engines and equipment In addition manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions water discharges and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances The most significant of the standards and regulations affecting us are discussed below Vehicle Emissions Control US Requirements Federal and California Tailpipe Emission Standards Both the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the California Air Resources Board CARB have established motor vehicle tailpipe and evaporative emissions standards that become increasingly stringent over time Seventeen states have adopted Californias lightduty standards four states have adopted Californias heavyduty standards and other states are expected to join Both federal and California regulations also require motor vehicles to be equipped with onboard diagnostic OBD systems that monitor emissionrelated systems and components In addition light and mediumduty vehicles and heavyduty engines must be certified by EPA prior to sale in the United States and by CARB prior to sale in California and the relevant states Canada accepts EPA certification Compliance with emissions standards OBD requirements and related regulations can be challenging and can drive increased product development costs warranty costs and vehicle recalls CARB has adopted new emissions regulations applicable to model year 2024 heavyduty engines as well as extended heavyduty warranty requirements beginning with the 2022 model year and EPA has proposed more stringent heavyduty standards beginning with the 2027 model year These rules include more stringent emissions standards as well as new requirements affecting durability testing warranty and OBD CARB has also adopted new lightduty emissions standards applicable to 2026 model year vehicles including a more stringent emissions standard and other new emissions requirements These new rules are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on the development of lightduty vehicles and heavyduty engines Compliance with automobile emissions standards depends in part on the widespread availability of highquality and consistent automotive fuels that the vehicles were designed to use Legislative regulatory and judicial developments related to fuel quality at both the national and state levels could affect vehicle manufacturers warranty costs as well as their ability to comply with vehicle emissions standards 7 Item 1 Business Continued The California vehicle emissions program also includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale zeroemission vehicles ZEVs Californias lightduty vehicle ZEV regulation which uses a system based on credits that can be banked and carried forward mandates annual increases in the production and sale of batteryelectric fuel cell and plugin hybrid vehicles For 2025 model year this regulation will require approximately 22 of a manufacturers California lightduty vehicle sales volume be ZEVs In August 2022 California approved a sweeping revision to the ZEV regulation Beginning with the 2026 model year the revised ZEV rule mandates a 35 ZEV sales requirement rising to 100 by 2035 The revised regulation also imposes significant restrictions on credit usage and new requirements for EV battery durability California has also instituted ZEV regulations governing medium and heavyduty vehicles beginning with the 2024 model year These stringent ZEV requirements covering light medium and heavyduty vehicles could entail significant costs and compliance challenges and include complex warranty and recall requirements Compliance with ZEV rules depends on market conditions including the pace of adoption of EVs technology readiness and battery raw material availability as well as the availability of adequate infrastructure to support vehicle charging European Requirements European Union EU and UK regulations directives and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the EU and the United Kingdom Regulatory stringency has increased significantly with the application of Stage VI emission standards first introduced in 2014 and the implementation of a laboratory test cycle for CO and emissions and the introduction of onroad emission testing using portable emission analyzers Real Driving Emission or RDE These onroad emission tests are in addition to the laboratorybased tests first introduced in 2017 The divergence between the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory conditions and the allowed values measured in RDE tests will ultimately be reduced to zero as the regulatory demands increase In addition new requirements for tailpipe and nontailpipe emissions will be included in the upcoming Euro 7 regulation and the leadtime for engineering and type approval may potentially be too short The costs associated with complying with all of these requirements are significant and following the EU Commissions indication of its intent to accelerate emissions rules in its road map publication EU Green Deal as well as the EU sustainable mobility action plan these challenges will continue in European markets including the United Kingdom In addition the Whole Vehicle Type Approval WVTA regulation has been updated to increase the stringency of inmarket surveillance Moreover following the UKs withdrawal from the European Union we may be subject to diverging requirements in our European markets which could increase vehicle complexity and duties There is an increasing trend of city access restrictions for internal combustion engine powered vehicles The access rules being introduced are developed by individual cities based on their specific concerns resulting in rapid deployment of access rules that differ greatly among cities The speed of implementation of access rules may directly influence customer vehicle residual values and choice of next purchase In an effort to support the Paris Accord some countries are adopting yearly increases in CO taxes where such a system is in place and publishing dates by when internal combustion powered vehicles may no longer be registered eg Norway in 2025 and the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in 2030 Other National Requirements Many countries in an effort to address air quality and climate change concerns are adopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe UNECE mobile source emission regulations Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of European or US regulations For example the China Stage VI lightduty vehicle emission standards based on European Stage VI emission standards for lightduty vehicles US evaporative and refueling emissions standards and CARB OBD II requirements incorporate two levels of stringency for tailpipe emissions Under the level one VIa standard which is currently in place nationwide in China the emissions limits are comparable to the EU Stage VI limits except for carbon monoxide which is 30 lower than the EU Stage VI limit The more stringent level two VIb standards emissions limits are approximately 3050 lower than the EU Stage VI limits depending on the pollutant While level two VIb is not slated for nationwide implementation until July 2023 the government has encouraged the more economically developed cities and provinces to pull ahead implementation For example Beijing Shanghai Tianjin Hebei province and Guangdong province have all begun implementing level two VIb Both China Stage VII lightduty vehicle and heavy duty vehicle emission regulations are currently under prestudy and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has advised that the Stage VII regulations will have more stringent limits on pollutant emissions and will establish limits for greenhouse gas primarily CO tailpipe emissions In South America most countries are evolving to implement more stringent requirements accepting Europe and US regulations except Brazil which has a unique local process called PROCONVE based on US regulations for lightduty vehicles and European regulations for heavyduty vehicles 8 Item 1 Business Continued Canadian criteria emissions regulations are largely aligned with US requirements however the existing ZEV regulations in Quebec and those published in British Columbia in July 2020 are more stringent than those in place in California Both British Columbia and Quebec have proposed draft amendments to their regulations to increase requirements starting in 2025 and 2026 respectively The federal government has published draft lightduty ZEV sales requirements through an amendment to the Passenger Automobile and Light Truck Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations and has also published its intent to develop ZEV sales requirements for heavyduty vehicles Other provinces have signaled their interest in lightduty ZEV sales regulations but are awaiting the finalization of the federal ZEV regulations Elsewhere there is a mix of regulations and processes based on US and EU standards Not all countries have adopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emission standards adopted This could lead to compliance problems particularly if OBD or inuse surveillance requirements are implemented Global Developments In recent years EPA and CARB have increased their focus on the use of defeat devices Defeat devices are elements of design typically embedded in software that improperly cause the emission control system to function less effectively during normal onroad driving than during an official laboratory emissions test without justification They are prohibited by law in many jurisdictions and we do not use defeat devices in our vehicles Regulators around the world continue to scrutinize automakers emission testing which has led to a number of defeat device settlements by various manufacturers EPA is carrying out additional nonstandard tests as part of its vehicle certification program CARB has also been conducting extensive nonstandard emission tests which in some cases have resulted in certification delays for diesel vehicles In the past several European countries have conducted nonstandard emission tests and published the results and in some cases this supplemental testing has triggered investigations of manufacturers for possible defeat devices Testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis In addition plaintiffs attorneys are pursuing consumer class action lawsuits based on alleged excessive emissions from cars and trucks which could in turn prompt further investigations by regulators Vehicle Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Standards US Requirements LightDuty Vehicles Federal law requires that lightduty vehicles meet minimum corporate average fuel economy CAFE standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA Manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the CAFE standard in any model year after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years The law requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each manufacturers fleet of domestic passenger cars imported passenger cars and lightduty trucks EPA also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act Because the vast majority of GHGs emitted by a vehicle are the result of fuel combustion GHG emission standards are similar to fuel economy standards Thus NHTSA and EPA coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and GHG standards respectively to avoid potential inconsistencies Beginning with the 2012 model year EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated harmonized GHG and fuel economy regulations under what came to be known as the One National Program ONP framework California which had promulgated its own statespecific set of GHG regulations agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with its own GHG requirements thereby avoiding a patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state GHG standards ONP has required manufacturers to achieve increasingly stringent yearoveryear standards ONP was envisioned to continue at least through the 2025 model year In 2020 EPA introduced significantly less stringent fuel economy and GHG standards applicable to model years 20212026 The federal government also revoked Californias authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards as well as the authority of other states that opted in to Californias standards California continued to assert its authority to regulate vehicle GHGs challenged in court the federal governments preemption actions withdrew from ONP and planned to return to enforcing its own statespecific GHG standards 9 Item 1 Business Continued The litigation over both standards and preemption with uncertain outcomes created difficulty for purposes of Fords future product planning To avoid a bifurcated regulatory scenario in which California and the 15 other states that adopted Californias GHG standards enforce one set of rules while a different set of rules applies in the rest of the country Ford reached an agreement with California on a set of terms for an alternative framework in which Ford committed to meet a designated set of standards on a national basis in lieu of the California regulatory program This framework enabled Ford to continue its product planning on a nationwide basis while being consistent with Fords environmental goals Ford finalized its agreement with California in 2020 and other states that adopted the California standards indicated they would respect the agreement In 2021 EPA again reevaluated the stringency of lightduty fuel economy and GHG standards through the 2026 model year and considered whether to restore the stringency to the previous ONP levels or greater EPA finalized this evaluation in December 2021 establishing GHG standards applicable to model years 20232026 with stringency that exceeded ONP levels In 2022 NHTSA finalized more stringent fuel economy standards for model years 20242026 which are substantially aligned with EPAs GHG standards The federal government also acted in December 2021 to repeal its rule blocking Californias authority to set and enforce its own vehicle GHG standards as well as the authority of other states that adopted Californias standards and EPA took similar action in early 2022 under the Clean Air Act In late 2022 EPA began consideration of sweeping changes to lightduty GHG regulations for model years 2027 and beyond These regulations are expected to extend through at least the 2030 model year and to drive significant ZEV sales mix along with rapid improvement of ICE vehicle performance by virtue of greatly increased stringency These new rules are expected to impose increased challenges and costs on the development of lightduty vehicles If any federal or state agency imposes and enforces fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market conditions Ford would likely be forced to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on its sales volumes and results of operations Such actions likely would include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options increasing market support programs for Fords most fuelefficient vehicles and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicles such as highperformance cars utilities andor fullsize light trucks in order to maintain compliance US Requirements HeavyDuty Vehicles EPA and NHTSA have jointly promulgated GHG and fuel economy standards for heavyduty vehicles generally vehicles over 8500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating through the 2027 model year and EPA is preparing a major update to these standards for the 2027 model year and beyond In Fords case the standards primarily affect heavyduty pickup trucks and vans plus vocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks As the heavyduty standards increase in stringency it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavyduty trucks European Requirements The European Union regulates passenger car and light commercial vehicle CO emissions using sliding scales with different CO targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for its fleet of vehicles first registered in a calendar year with separate targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles A penalty system applies to manufacturers failing to meet the individual CO targets Pooling agreements between manufacturers to utilize credits are possible under certain conditions and we have entered into such pooling agreements in order to comply with fuel economy regulations without paying a penalty and to enable other manufacturers to benefit from our positive CO performance For multistage vehicles eg Fords Transit chassis cabs the base manufacturer eg Ford is fully responsible for the CO performance of the final upfitted vehicles The initial target levels get significantly more stringent every five years 2025 2030 and 2035 after which all new vehicles must be zero emission requiring significant investments in propulsion technologies and extensive fleet management forcing low CO emissions The United Kingdom and Switzerland have introduced similar rules and the United Kingdom is considering adopting ZEV mandates The EU Commission is investigating the introduction of Real Driving CO and Life Cycle Assessment elements and heavyduty vehicles are addressed in separate regulations with analogous requirements and challenges As discussed above the EU Commission has announced a Green Deal that is likely to trigger more stringent requirements for CO emissions including stricter CO fleet regulations and other regulated emissions and include recycling and substance restrictions While the EU Commission targets net climate neutrality by 2050 and a more ambitious 2030 interim target a 55 instead of 40 CO reduction compared to 1990 several countries such as Germany have adopted stricter interim targets and earlier net climate neutrality targets Ford also faces the risk of advance premium payments for both passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in all European markets due to for example unexpected market fluctuations and shorter lead times impacting average fleet performance 10 Item 1 Business Continued The United Nations developed a technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO This world lightduty test procedure WLTP is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory CO and fuel consumption figures with customerreported figures The introduction of WLTP in Europe started in September 2017 and requires updates to CO labeling thereby impacting taxes in countries with a CO tax scheme as well as CO fleet regulations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP are significant Some European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO vehicle emissions including fiscal measures and CO labeling to address country specific targets associated with the Paris Accord For example the United Kingdom France Germany Spain Portugal and the Netherlands among others have introduced taxation based on CO emissions The EU CO requirements are likely to trigger further measures In addition delayed vehicle launches and supply shortages as well as an insufficient charging infrastructure and lower demand for ZEV and low CO emission vehicles as certain electric vehicle incentives are reduced can trigger compliance risks in all European markets Other National Requirements The Canadian federal government regulates vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act In October 2014 the Canadian federal government published the final changes to the regulation for lightduty vehicles which maintain alignment with US EPA vehicle GHG standards for the 20172025 model years The revised US EPA standards were automatically adopted in Canada by reference for the 20222025 model years and draft amendments for a few standalone administrative elements not automatically adopted by reference were published in December 2022 The heavyduty vehicle and engine GHG emissions regulations for the 2021 model year and beyond were published in May 2018 and are in line with US requirements subject to any change in those requirements Chinas Corporate Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle NEV Credit Administrative Rules contain fuel consumption requirements as well as credit mandates for NEV passenger vehicles ie plugin hybrids battery electric vehicles or fuel cell vehicles The fuel consumption requirement uses a weightbased approach to establish targets with yearoveryear target reductions China set a target of 50L100km for the 2020 passenger vehicle industry fuel consumption fleet average which lowers to 40L100km by 2025 based on the New European Driving Cycle system The government is projecting a further fuel consumption reduction in 2030 and is targeting 35L100km based on the WLTP cycle WLTC system The NEV mandate requires that OEMs generate a specific amount of NEV credits each year with NEV credits of at least 16 18 28 and 38 of the annual ICE passenger vehicle production or import volume required in 2022 2023 2024 and 2025 respectively Future percentages are currently under consideration As discussed below in Item 1A Risk Factors under Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans to comply with safety emissions fuel economy autonomous vehicle and other regulations a production disruption stop ship lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product plans or in some cases purchase credits in order to comply with fuel economy standards Vehicle Safety US Requirements The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 the Safety Act regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in two primary ways First the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly and has continued to evolve as global compliance and public domain eg New Car Assessment Programs NCAPs Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHS requirements continue to evolve are increasing in demands and lack harmonization globally As we expand our business priorities to include autonomous vehicles and broader mobility products and services our financial exposure has increased Second the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial European Requirements The EU has established vehicle safety standards and regulations and is likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirements in the future especially in the areas of access to invehicle data artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles 11 Item 1 Business Continued The European General Safety Regulation GSR introduced UNECE regulations which are required for the European Type Approval process The GSR includes the mandatory introduction of multiple active and passive safety features including cybersecurity requirements for new vehicle models from 2022 and for all registrations in 2024 EU regulators are focusing on active safety features such as lane departure warning systems electronic stability control and automatic brake assist Furthermore mobile network providers in certain EU Member States have begun shutting down their 2G and 3G networks which form the basis for eCall system functionality in existing vehicles The eCall systems in existing vehicles may need to be updated as these systems are phased out It is also possible that the EU may mandate Member States to maintain these networks to allow for the continued functionality of existing eCall systems Other National Requirements Globally governments generally have been adopting UNECE based regulations with minor variations to address local concerns Any difference between North American and UNECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to the development of global platform vehicles and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing a common level of safety performance several ongoing bilateral negotiations on free trade can potentially contribute to this goal Safety and recall requirements in Brazil China India South Korea and Gulf Cooperation Council GCC countries may add substantial costs and complexity to our global recall practice Brazil has set mandatory fleet safety targets and penalties are applied if these levels are not maintained while a tax reduction may be available for overperformance In Canada regulatory requirements are currently aligned with US regulations however under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or noncompliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety In 2021 Canada started preliminary consultations on several new proposed regulations including Administrative Monetary Penalties AMPs and Analysis of Technical Information for Vehicles and Equipment ACTIVE regulations Draft language for the AMPs regulation was published in May 2022 with final regulations expected to be published at the end of 2023 In China a new mandatory Event Data Recorder regulation that is more comprehensive than US requirements has been released and in China Malaysia and South Korea mandatory eCall requirements are being drafted ECall is mandatory in the UAE for new vehicles starting with the 2021 model year and in Saudi Arabia from the 2025 model year New Car Assessment Programs Organizations around the world rate and compare motor vehicles in NCAPs to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations and use stars to rate vehicle safety with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest Achieving high NCAP ratings which may vary by country or region can add complexity and cost to vehicles Similarly environmental rating systems exist in various regions eg Green NCAP in Europe In China CNCAP has a stringent rating structure to decrease the number of fivestar ratings Further the China Insurance Auto Safety Index similar to IIHS has been implemented with higher standards for passenger and pedestrian protection and driver assistance technologies These protocols impose additional requirements relating to testing evaluation and mandatory safety features and compliance with them or any subsequent updates to them may be costly 12 Item 1 Business Continued HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES People Strategy and Governance We strive to create an employee experience that enables an inclusive environment of excellence focus and collaboration among team members allowing us to deliver short and longterm business success Ford maintains an Executive People Forum consisting of the CEO and top leadership team that meets monthly with a specific focus on people and organizational topics that will enable and accelerate delivery of the business plan Key topic areas include Compensation Retention Diversity Equity and Inclusion DEI Organization Design Talent Planning Development and Culture Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide important oversight on certain human capital matters including items discussed at the Executive People Forum The Compensation Talent and Culture Committee maintains responsibility to review discuss and set strategic direction for various peoplerelated business strategies including compensation and benefit programs leadership succession planning culture DEI and talent development programs The Sustainability Innovation and Policy Committee is responsible for discussing and advising management on maintaining and improving sustainability strategies the implementation of which creates value consistent with the longterm preservation and enhancement of shareholder value and social wellbeing including human rights working conditions and responsible sourcing The collective recommendations to the Board and its committees are how we proactively manage our human capital and create an employee experience that allows employees and our organization to thrive Diversity Equity and Inclusion At Ford we believe that creating a Culture of Inclusion for all our employees is both foundational to achieving our Ford plan and the right thing to do Ford offers 12 Employee Resource Groups ERGs that represent various dimensions of our employee population including racial ethnic gender religious sexual orientation and gender identity ability and generational communities with chapters throughout the world in addition to Ford Advocacy for Belonging FAB Councils in every region Our ERGs and FAB Councils are instrumental in providing a voice to our globally diverse workforce as well as sharing valuable insights into the development of products services and experiences Our business has developed DEI action plans specific to each regions unique needs and culture From an enterprise perspective we have taken several concrete steps to further these efforts including embedding DEI into our corporate strategy and governance ensuring that revisions to employee expected behaviors enable an inclusive culture and establishing objectives for progress for every salaried employee This holistic DEI strategy includes a strong focus on racial equity growing representation of diverse talent throughout the pipeline and DEI education Our diversity statistics include the following as of December 31 2022 based on selfreporting at the date of hire 288 of our salaried employees worldwide are females excludes certain employees in Europe in accordance with the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation 254 of our total salaried and hourly employees in the United States are females and 362 of our total salaried and hourly employees in the United States are minorities Talent Attraction Growth and Capability Assessment The workplace is quickly evolving and new working practices are constantly developing Many employees are no longer bound to physical locations where and how we source our talent is evolving and employee expectations have shifted From a growth perspective we are focused on several key areas vital to our success eg software electrification and data science Ford continues to accelerate its efforts to attract new employees with diverse skill sets and capabilities and more resources have been dedicated to recruiting these employees who are critical to supporting our business model From a capability perspective we are leveraging best practices in assessments and talent management to strengthen our current capabilities and future pipeline while reinforcing a culture of belonging collaboration empowerment and innovation The performance management process is reviewed regularly to ensure we set clear expectations measure individual performance and reward appropriately We are also creating targeted learning experiences democratizing learning and career development opportunities across the organization and empowering employees to design their own career paths with skill development targeted for the roles of today and the future 13 Item 1 Business Continued Finally the extent to which our People Leaders are equipped to care for inspire and empower our people plays a vital role in our strategy and we are committed to helping our leaders strengthen these capabilities with dedicated learning paths and nontraditional learning opportunities Our Leadership mechanism for developing People Leaders guides how we think about performance management and how we assess our talent to meet our organizational needs Leadership will continue to prepare and empower our People Leaders to lead our teams through significant change at our Company and in our industry Employee Health and Safety Nothing is more important than the health safety and wellbeing of our employees and we consistently strive to achieve worldclass levels of safety through the application of sound policies and best practices We maintain a robust safety culture to reduce workplace injuries supported by effective communication reporting and external benchmarking We verify compliance with regulatory requirements as well as our internal safety standards and regularly report to Company management on key safety issues including significant incidents and high potential nearmisses to prevent recurrences We also participate in multiindustry groups within and outside the automotive sector to share safety best practices and collaborate to address common issues Our Safety Record Any loss of life or serious injury in the workplace is unacceptable and deeply regretted Unfortunately there were two fatal incidents in 2022 in our China region Another key safety indicator is our global losttime case rate LTCR which is defined as the number of cases where one or more working days is lost due to workrelated injuryillness per 200000 hours worked While our global LTCR remains stable overall there was an increase to 039 in 2022 from 035 in 2021 We will continue our efforts to reduce workplace injuries Employee Wellbeing Initiatives Our global holistic approach to wellbeing encompasses the financial social mentalemotional physical and professional needs of our employees Foundational to our wellbeing philosophy is providing a broad array of resources and solutions to educate employees build capability and meet individual and organizational wellbeing needs and goals Wellbeing is an integral part of our total rewards strategy as we work to address business and employee challenges through a multichannel approach that provides our diverse populations and global regions flexibility and choice to meet their specific needs We use datadriven insights gathered through surveys focus groups and claims data to understand employee needs and prioritize our wellbeing efforts We provide global wellbeing programs such as Employee Assistance Programs and mindfulness sessions among other things In addition we provide employees with experiences selfguided tools and social connection opportunities as well as access to the professional support and resources they need to achieve their own sense of wellbeing We are committed to creating an environment where employees and People Leaders care for each other as we deliver Ford Employee Sentiment Strategy We leverage our asklistenobserve framework to understand employee sentiment at Ford This approach is a holistic and consistent methodology that enables us to understand how employees are feeling in real time and act accordingly Our measurement focuses on several areas that are key to our business Employee Mental and Emotional Wellbeing Health Safety Employee Experience Culture DEI Leadership and Strategic Alignment Our employee sentiment surveys guide the actions we take to address employee concerns and related risks and also help us understand whether our efforts to drive change in these areas are effective A critical element of our measurement program is ensuring that data ends up in the hands of those who are best positioned to drive meaningful change To this end leaders at all levels have access to dashboards with data from their teams and organizations as well as personalized next step recommendations embedded into action planning tools Our measurement approach is also used to inform our areas of focus as an organization and to evaluate the effectiveness of talent initiatives across the enterprise 14 Item 1 Business Continued Employment Data The approximate number of individuals employed by us and entities that we consolidated as of December 31 was as follows in thousands 2021 2022 North America 99 98 South America 4 4 Europe 42 35 China including Taiwan 3 4 International Markets Group 16 14 Total Automotive 164 155 Ford Credit 5 5 Mobility 2 0 Corporate and Other 12 13 Total Company 183 173 The reduction in employees in 2022 is primarily a result of certain divestitures in Europe and in our Mobility segment and the cessation of operations at certain plants in India Substantially all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements In the United States approximately 99 of these unionized hourly employees in our Automotive segment are represented by the International Union United Automobile Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America UAW or United Auto Workers At December 31 2022 approximately 57000 hourly employees in the United States were represented by the UAW 15 ITEM 1A Risk Factors We have listed below the material risk factors applicable to us grouped into the following categories Operational Risks Macroeconomic Market and Strategic Risks Financial Risks and Legal and Regulatory Risks Operational Risks Ford and Ford Credits financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by public health issues including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID19 We face various risks related to public health issues including epidemics pandemics and other outbreaks including the global outbreak of COVID19 The impact of COVID19 including changes in consumer behavior pandemic fears and market downturns and restrictions on business and individual activities has periodically created significant volatility in the global economy There have been extraordinary actions taken by international federal state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID19 in regions throughout the world including travel bans quarantines stayathome orders and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations For example in 2020 consistent with the actions taken by governmental authorities we idled our manufacturing operations in regions around the world before ultimately resuming our manufacturing operations taking a phased approach and after introducing new safety protocols at our plants To the extent cases surge in any locations stringent limitations on daily activities that may have been eased previously could be reinstated in those areas A future suspension of our manufacturing operations could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations Moreover outbreaks in certain regions continue to cause intermittent disruptions in our supply chain and local manufacturing operations For example in China outbreaks of COVID19 have led the government to impose lockdowns and other restrictions which have adversely affected our and our supply chains production operations our wholesales and consumer demand for our products Further as new strains or variants of COVID19 or other viruses diseases or public health issues develop or sufficient amounts of vaccines or treatments are not available not widely administered for a significant period of time or otherwise prove ineffective the impact of a widespread public health issue on the global economy and in turn our financial condition liquidity and results of operations could be material The predominant share of Ford Credits business consists of financing Ford and Lincoln vehicles and the duration or resurgence of public health issues such as COVID19 may negatively impact the level of originations at Ford Credit For example Fords suspension of manufacturing operations a significant decline in dealer showroom traffic andor a reduction of operations at dealers may lead to a significant decline in Ford Credits consumer and nonconsumer originations Moreover economic uncertainty and higher unemployment arising from widespread public health issues or otherwise may result in higher defaults in Ford Credits consumer portfolio and prolonged unemployment may have a negative impact on both new and used vehicle demand As described in more detail below under Ford and Ford Credits access to debt securitization or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades market volatility market disruption regulatory requirements or other factors the volatility created by COVID19 adversely affected Ford and Ford Credits access to the debt and securitization markets and its cost of funding and any volatility in the capital markets as a result of a public health issue or for any other reason could have an adverse impact on Ford and Ford Credits access to those markets and its cost of funding The full impact of COVID19 or any widespread public health issue on our financial condition and results of operations will depend on the duration and scope of an outbreak including any potential future waves the emergence or reemergence of variants and their transmissibility and the success of vaccination programs and treatments its impact on our customers dealers and suppliers how quickly normal economic conditions operations and the demand for our products can resume and any permanent behavioral changes that the pandemic may cause For example the duration of a suspension of manufacturing operations and a return to our full production schedule will depend in part on not only a sufficient number of employees being able to return to work but also whether our suppliers and dealers have resumed normal operations Our Ford Blue Ford Model e and Ford Pro operations generally do not realize revenue while our manufacturing operations are suspended but we continue to incur operating and nonoperating expenses resulting in a deterioration of our cash flow Accordingly any significant future disruption to our production schedule regionally or globally whether as a result of our own or a suppliers suspension of operations could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and results of operations Moreover our supply and distribution chains may be disrupted by supplier or dealer bankruptcies or their permanent discontinuation of operations triggered by a shutdown of operations due to a widespread public health issue or for other reasons 16 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Public health issues may also exacerbate other risks disclosed in our 2022 Form 10K Report including but not limited to our competitiveness demand or market acceptance for our products and services and shifting consumer preferences and our ability to successfully execute our strategy Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Fords production schedule and specifications and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components such as semiconductors or raw materials such as lithium cobalt nickel graphite and manganese can disrupt Fords production of vehicles Our products contain components that we source globally from suppliers who in turn source components from their suppliers If there is a shortage of a key component in our supply chain or a supplier is unable to deliver a component to us in accordance with our specifications because of a production issue limited availability of materials shipping problems restrictions on transactions with certain countries or companies or other reason and the component cannot be easily sourced from a different supplier or we are unable to obtain a component on a timely basis the shortage may disrupt our operations or increase our costs of production For example the automotive industry continues to face a significant shortage of semiconductors which has a complex supply chain with long lead times required to increase production and capacity The shortage is due in large part to strong crossindustry demand which has presented challenges and production disruptions globally including at our assembly plants and COVID19related work restrictions in various parts of the world have further impacted semiconductor production Accordingly we and our competitors who need integrated circuits are experiencing various levels of semiconductor impact For the production of our electric vehicles we are dependent on the supply of batteries and the raw materials eg lithium cobalt nickel graphite and manganese used by our suppliers to produce those batteries As we increase our production of electric vehicles we expect our need for such materials to increase significantly At the same time other companies are increasing their production of electric vehicles which will further increase the demand for such raw materials As a result we may be unable to acquire raw materials needed for electric vehicle production in sufficient amounts that are responsibly sourced or at reasonable prices As described below under To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles Ford has entered into and expects to continue to enter into multiyear commitments to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast as well as in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7 below we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into offtake agreements and other longterm purchase contracts that obligate us subject to certain conditions such as quality or minimum output to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output from certain raw materials suppliers In the event the supplier under those agreements or any of our or our suppliers raw material supply contracts is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of raw materials needed for our or our suppliers production operations eg if a mine does not produce at expected levels or the raw materials do not otherwise satisfy our requirements and we or our suppliers are unable to find an alternative resource with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices responsibly sourced and in a timely manner it could impact our ability to produce electric vehicles A shortage of or our inability to acquire or find adequate suppliers of key components or raw materials as a result of disruptions in the supply chain capacity constraints limited availability competition for those items within the automotive industry and other sectors or otherwise can cause a significant disruption to our production schedule and have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles Ford has entered into and expects to continue to enter into multiyear commitments to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast We have announced plans to significantly increase our electric vehicle production volumes however our ability to produce higher volumes of electric vehicles is dependent upon the availability of raw materials necessary for the production of batteries eg lithium cobalt nickel graphite and manganese among others As described above under Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Fords production schedule and specifications and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components such as semiconductors or raw materials such as lithium cobalt nickel graphite and manganese can disrupt Fords production of vehicles to facilitate our access to such raw materials we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into offtake agreements and other longterm purchase contracts Such agreements obligate us subject to certain conditions such as quality or minimum output to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output from raw material suppliers over an agreed upon period of time pursuant to an agreed upon purchase price mechanism that is typically based upon the market price of the material at the time of delivery 17 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Unlike our historical arrangements with suppliers which are typically annual commitments under multiyear offtake agreements and other longterm purchase contracts the risks associated with lowerthanexpected electric vehicle production volumes or changes in battery technology that reduce the need for certain raw materials are borne by Ford rather than our suppliers In the event we do not purchase the materials pursuant to the terms of these agreements even if the supplier finds another purchaser we may be obligated to reimburse the supplier for costs it incurs in finding the new purchaser as well as any lost revenue attributable to the replacement purchaser paying a lower price than required under the pricing mechanism in our agreement As a result of the competition for and limited availability of the raw materials needed for our electric vehicle business the costs of such materials are difficult to accurately forecast as they may fluctuate during the term of the offtake agreements and other longterm purchase contracts based on market conditions Accordingly we may be subject to increases in the prices we pay for those raw materials and our ability to recoup such costs through increased pricing to our customers may be limited As a result our margins results of operations financial condition and reputation may be adversely impacted by commitments we make pursuant to offtake agreements and other longterm purchase contracts Fords longterm competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford We previously announced our plan for growth and value creation Ford Ford is focused on delivering distinctive and increasingly electric products plus AlwaysOn customer relationships and user experiences Our Ford plan is designed to leverage our foundational strengths to build new capabilities enriching customer experiences and deepening loyalty As we undertake this transformation of our business we must integrate our strategic initiatives into a cohesive business model and balance competing priorities or we will not be successful To facilitate this transformation we are making substantial investments recruiting new talent and optimizing our business model management system and organization Accordingly maintaining discipline in our capital allocation continues to be important as a strong core business and a balance sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in these new growth opportunities is critical to the success of our Ford plan If we are unable to optimize our capital allocation among vehicles services technology and other calls on capital or we are otherwise not successful in executing Ford or are delayed for reasons outside of our control we may not be able to realize the full benefits of our plan which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations Furthermore if we fail to make progress on our plan at the pace that shareholders expect it may lead to an increase in shareholder activism which may disrupt the conduct of our business and divert managements attention and resources Fords vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches recall campaigns or increased warranty costs Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard We may also be obligated to remedy defects or potentially recall our vehicles due to defective components provided to us by our suppliers arising from their quality issues or otherwise NHTSAs enforcement strategy has resulted in significant civil penalties being levied and the use of consent orders requiring direct oversight by NHTSA of certain manufacturers safety processes a trend that could continue Should we or government safety regulators determine that a safety or other defect or a noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles prior to the start of production the launch of such vehicle could be delayed until such defect is remedied The cost of recall and customer satisfaction actions to remedy defects in vehicles that have been sold could be substantial particularly if the actions relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production For example NHTSA and the automotive industry are currently engaged in a study of the safety of approximately 56 million Takata desiccated airbag inflators in the United States Of these approximately three and a half million of the inflators are in our vehicles Should NHTSA determine that the inflators contain a safety defect Ford and other manufacturers could potentially face significant incremental recall costs Further to the extent recall and customer satisfaction actions relate to defective components we receive from suppliers our ability to recover from the suppliers may be limited by the suppliers financial condition We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time a vehicle is sold and we reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis In addition from time to time we issue extended warranties at our expense the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance For additional information regarding warranty and field service action costs including our process for establishing our reserves see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 and Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements If warranty costs are greater than anticipated as a result of increased vehicle and component complexity the adoption of new technologies or otherwise such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations Furthermore launch delays recall actions and increased warranty costs could adversely affect our reputation or market acceptance of our products as discussed below under Fords new and existing products and digital software and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced 18 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances joint ventures acquisitions divestitures restructurings or new business strategies We have invested in formed strategic alliances with and announced or formed joint ventures with a number of companies and we may expand those relationships or enter into similar relationships with additional companies These initiatives typically involve enormous complexity may require a significant amount of capital and may involve a lengthy regulatory approval process As a result we may not be able to complete anticipated transactions the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be realized or the benefits may be delayed For example we may not successfully integrate an alliance or joint venture with our operations including the implementation of our controls systems procedures and policies or unforeseen expenses or liabilities may arise that were not discovered during due diligence prior to an investment or entry into a strategic alliance or a misalignment of interests may develop between us and the other party Further to the extent we share ownership control or management with another party in a joint venture our ability to influence the joint venture may be limited and we may be unable to prevent misconduct or implement our compliance or internal control systems In order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements and other longterm purchase contracts with raw materials suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers however we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these actions and our efforts to have such suppliers particularly those in less developed markets adopt Fords sustainability and other standards may be unsuccessful which could have an adverse impact on our reputation In addition a restructuring or the implementation of a new or different business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations including distracting management from current operations Results of operations from new activities may be lower than our existing activities and if a strategy is unsuccessful we may not recoup our investments which may be significant in that strategy Moreover we may continue to have financial exposure following a strategic divestiture or cessation of operations in a market and restructuring actions may cause us to incur significant costs record impairments or other charges subject us to potential claims from employees suppliers dealers or governmental authorities or harm our reputation Failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions or strategies described herein could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations Operational systems security systems vehicles and services could be affected by cyber incidents ransomware attacks and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers We rely on information technology networks and systems including invehicle systems and mobile devices some of which are managed by suppliers to process transmit and store electronic information that is important to the operation of our business our vehicles and the services we offer Despite security measures we are at risk for interruptions outages and compromises of i operational systems including business financial accounting product development consumer receivables data processing or manufacturing processes ii facility security systems andor iii invehicle systems or mobile devices whether caused by a ransomware or other cyber attack security breach or other reasons eg a natural disaster fire acts of terrorism or war or an overburdened infrastructure system Such incidents could materially disrupt operational systems result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information compromise the privacy of personal information of consumers employees or others jeopardize the security of our facilities affect the performance of invehicle systems or services we offer andor impact the safety of our vehicles This risk exposure rises as we continue to develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity Moreover we our suppliers and our dealers have been the target of cyber attacks in the past and such attacks will continue and evolve in the future which may cause cyber incidents to be more difficult to detect for periods of time Our networks and invehicle systems sharing similar architectures could also be impacted by or a data breach may result from the negligence or misconduct of insiders or third parties who have access to our networks and systems We continually employ capabilities processes and other security measures designed to reduce and mitigate the risk of cyber attacks and we rely on our suppliers to do the same for their operations however we may not be aware of all vulnerabilities and such preventative measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all potential risks including potential production disruption Moreover a cyber incident could harm our reputation cause customers to lose trust in our security measures andor subject us to regulatory actions or litigation which may result in fines penalties judgments or injunctions and a cyber incident involving us or one of our suppliers could impact production our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers 19 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Fords production as well as Fords suppliers production andor the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues natural or manmade disasters adverse effects of climate change financial distress production difficulties capacity limitations or other factors A work stoppage or other limitation on production could occur at Fords facilities at a facility in its supply chain or at one of its logistics providers for any number of reasons including as a result of labor issues including shortages of available employees disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements absenteeism public health issues eg COVID19 stayathome orders or in response to potential restructuring actions eg plant closures as a result of supplier financial distress or other production constraints such as limited quantities of components including but not limited to semiconductors or raw materials quality issues capacity limitations or other difficulties as a result of a natural disaster including climaterelated physical risk cyber incidents or for other reasons Further the limited availability of components labor shortages COVID19 and supplier operating issues has led to an inconsistent production schedule at our facilities This has exacerbated the disruption to our suppliers operations which in turn has led to higher costs and production shortfalls Given the worldwide scope of our supply chain and operations we and our suppliers face a risk of disruption or operating inefficiencies that may increase costs due to the adverse physical effects of climate change which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of weather and other natural events eg wildfires extended droughts and extreme temperatures In addition in the event a weatherrelated event strike international conflict or other occurrence limits the ability of freight carriers to deliver components and other materials from suppliers to us or logistics providers to transport our vehicles for an extended period of time it may increase our costs and delay or otherwise impact both our production operations and customers ability to receive our vehicles Many components used in our vehicles are available only from a single or limited number of suppliers and therefore cannot be resourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier due to long lead times new contractual commitments that may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the components or materials etc Such suppliers also could threaten to disrupt our production as leverage in negotiations In addition when we undertake a model changeover significant downtime at one or more of our production facilities may be required and our ability to return to full production may be delayed if we experience production difficulties at one of our facilities or a suppliers facility Moreover as vehicles components and their integration become more complex we may face an increased risk of a delay in production of new vehicles Regardless of the cause our ability to recoup lost production volume may be limited Accordingly a significant disruption to our production schedule could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards as discussed below under Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety emissions fuel economy autonomous driving technology environmental and other regulations Fords ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints The vast majority of the hourly employees in our Ford Blue and Ford Model e manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements These agreements provide guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the contract term and some degree of income security subject to certain conditions These agreements may restrict our ability to close plants and divest businesses A substantial number of our employees in other regions are represented by unions or government councils and legislation or custom promoting retention of manufacturing or other employment in the state country or region may constrain as a practical matter our ability to sell or close manufacturing or other facilities Fords ability to attract and retain talented diverse and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and competitiveness Our success depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain talented and diverse employees who are highly skilled in engineering software technology including digital capabilities and connectivity marketing and finance among other areas Competition for such employees is intense which has led to an increase in compensation throughout a tight labor market and accordingly may increase costs for employers We have struggled to hire and retain salaried skilled hourly and production hourly employees in some of our manufacturing and parts supplies and logistics locations In addition to compensation considerations current and potential employees are increasingly placing a premium on various intangibles such as working for companies with a clear purpose and strong brand reputation flexible work arrangements and other considerations such as embracing sustainability and diversity equity and inclusion initiatives If we are not perceived as an employer of choice we may be unable to recruit highly skilled employees Further if we lose existing employees with needed skills or we are unable to upskill and develop existing employees particularly with the introduction of new technologies it could have a substantial adverse effect on our business 20 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Macroeconomic Market and Strategic Risks Fords new and existing products and digital software and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced Although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicles and introducing new services many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace and we may not be able to accurately predict or identify emerging trends or preferences or the success of new products or services in the market It takes years to design and develop a new vehicle or change an existing vehicle Because customers preferences may change quickly our new and existing products may not generate sales in sufficient quantities and at costs low enough to be profitable and recoup investment costs Offering vehicles and services that customers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand but products and services that are perceived to be less desirable whether in terms of price quality styling safety overall value fuel efficiency or other attributes can exacerbate these risks For example if we are unable to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors develop innovative new products and services or sufficiently tailor our products and services to customers in other markets there could be insufficient demand for our products and services which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet social media and other media mere allegations relating to quality safety fuel efficiency sustainability corporate social responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services even where such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded Further our ability to successfully grow through capacity expansion and investments in the areas of electrification connectivity digital and physical services and software services depends on many factors including advancements in technology regulatory changes infrastructure development eg a widespread vehicle charging network and other factors that are difficult to predict that may significantly affect the future of electric and autonomous vehicles digital and physical services and software services The automotive software and digital service businesses are very competitive and are undergoing rapid changes Traditional competitors are expanding their offerings and new types of competitors particularly in our areas of strength eg pickup trucks utilities and commercial vehicles that may possess superior technology may have business models with certain aspects that are more efficient and are not subject to the same level of fixed costs as us are entering the market This level of competition increases the importance of our ability to anticipate develop and deliver products and services that customers desire on a timely basis in quantities in line with demand and at costs low enough to be profitable We have announced our intent to continue making multibillion dollar investments in electrification and software services Our plans include offering electrified versions of many of our vehicles including the F150 Lightning and ETransit If the market for electrified vehicles does not develop at the rate we expect even if the regulatory framework encourages a rapid adoption of electrified vehicles there is a negative perception of our vehicles or about electric vehicles in general or if consumers prefer our competitors vehicles there could be an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations Further as discussed below under Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety emissions fuel economy autonomous driving technology environmental and other regulations lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles may impact our strategy to comply with fuel economy standards Ford is addressing its impact on climate change aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement by working to reduce our carbon footprint over time across our vehicles operations and supply chain We have announced interim emissions targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative SBTi and made other statements about similar initiatives eg our expected electric vehicle volumes in future years Achievement of these initiatives will require significant investments and the implementation of new processes however there is no assurance that the desired outcomes will be achieved To the extent we are unable to achieve these initiatives or our transition to electrification is slower than expected it may harm our reputation or we may not otherwise receive the expected return on the investment For example we are exposed to reputational risk if we do not reduce vehicle CO emissions in line with our targets or in compliance with applicable regulations Further our customers and investors evaluate how well we are progressing on our announced climate goals and aspirations and if we are not on track to achieve those goals and aspirations on a timely basis or if the expectations of our customers and investors change and we do not adequately address their expectations our reputation could be impacted and customers may choose to purchase the products and services of investors may choose to invest in and suppliers and vendors may choose to do business with other companies 21 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Moreover new offerings including those related to electric vehicles and autonomous driving technologies may present technological challenges that could be costly to implement and overcome and may subject us to customer claims if they do not operate as anticipated In addition since new technologies are subject to market acceptance a malfunction involving any manufacturers autonomous vehicle may negatively impact the perception of autonomous vehicles and erode customer trust Fords results are dependent on sales of larger more profitable vehicles particularly in the United States A shift in consumer preferences away from larger more profitable vehicles with internal combustion engines including trucks and utilities to electric or other vehicles in our portfolio that may be less profitable could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations If demand for electric vehicles grows at a rate greater than our ability to increase our production capacity for those vehicles lower market share and revenue as well as facility and other assetrelated charges eg accelerated depreciation associated with the production of internal combustion vehicles may result In addition government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency eg ZEV mandates and low emission zones and other factors that accelerate the transition to electric vehicles may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins With a global footprint Fords results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs or other events Because of the interconnectedness of the global economy the challenges of a pandemic a financial crisis economic downturn or recession natural disaster war geopolitical crises or other significant events in one area of the world can have an immediate and material adverse impact on markets around the world Changes in international trade policy can also have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations Steps taken by governments to apply or consider applying tariffs on automobiles parts and other products and materials have the potential to disrupt existing supply chains impose additional costs on our business and may lead to other countries attempting to retaliate by imposing tariffs which would make our products more expensive for customers and in turn could make our products less competitive In particular China presents unique risks to US automakers due to the strain in USChina relations Chinas unique regulatory landscape and the level of integration with key components in our global supply chain Ford has operations in various markets with volatile economic or political environments This may expose us to heightened risks as a result of economic geopolitical or other events including governmental takeover ie nationalization of our manufacturing facilities or intellectual property restrictive exchange or import controls disruption of operations as a result of systemic political or economic instability outbreak of war or expansion of hostilities such as the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine and acts of terrorism each of which could impact our supply chain as well as our operations and have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations Further the US government other governments and international organizations could impose additional sanctions or export controls that could restrict us from doing business directly or indirectly in or with certain countries or parties which could include affiliates Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis recession or significant geopolitical event Because we like other manufacturers have a higher proportion of fixed structural costs relatively small changes in industry sales volume can have a substantial effect on our cash flow and results of operations Vehicle sales are affected by overall economic and market conditions and developing trends such as shared vehicle ownership and the transportation as a service model eg ridesharing services If industry vehicle sales were to decline to levels significantly below our planning assumption the decline could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flow For a discussion of economic trends see Item 7 Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity currency fluctuations competitive actions or other factors The global automotive industry is intensely competitive with installed manufacturing capacity generally exceeding current demand Historically industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share these incentives historically have included a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs price rebates and other incentives As a result we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher marketing incentives commodity or other cost increases tariffs or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations This risk includes cost advantages foreign competitors may have because of their weaker home market currencies which may in turn enable those competitors to offer their products at lower prices Further higher inventory levels put downward pressure on pricing which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations As the automotive industry transitions to electric vehicles excess capacity particularly for internal combustion engine trucks and utilities may continue or increase This excess capacity may further increase price competition in that segment of the market which could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 22 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market value of Ford or Ford Credits investments including marketable securities can have a significant effect on results We and our suppliers are exposed to inflationary pressure and a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in commodity and energy prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce potentially adverse effects on our business Changes in commodity and energy prices from tariffs and the actions taken by Russia in Ukraine as discussed above under With a global footprint Fords results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs or other events or otherwise currency exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted hedged or offset with price increases to eliminate earnings volatility As a result significant changes in commodity and energy prices foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates as well as increased material freight logistics and similar costs could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations See Item 7 and Item 7A for additional discussion of currency commodity and energy price and interest rate risks For example interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets Accordingly the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt tighter monetary policy and potentially higher longterm interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business At Ford Credit rising interest rates may impact Ford Credits ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates which could reduce its financing margin In addition our results are impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments with unrealized gains and losses that could be material in any period Financial Risks Ford and Ford Credits access to debt securitization or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades market volatility market disruption regulatory requirements or other factors Ford and Ford Credits ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost is dependent on their credit ratings or their perceived creditworthiness Further Ford Credits ability to obtain securitized funding under its committed assetbacked liquidity programs and certain other assetbacked securitization transactions is subject to having a sufficient amount of assets eligible for these programs as well as Ford Credits ability to obtain appropriate credit ratings and for certain committed programs derivatives to manage the interest rate risk Over time and particularly in the event of credit rating downgrades market volatility market disruption or other factors Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints In addition Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates if there is a significant decline in the demand for the types of securities it offers or Ford Credit is unable to obtain derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its securitization transactions A significant reduction in the amount of receivables Ford Credit purchases or originates would significantly reduce its ongoing results of operations and could adversely affect its ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles Furthermore in addition to rising interest rates adversely affecting overall economic activity and the financial condition of our customers increases in interest rates could cause credit market disruptions which have historically resulted in higher borrower costs and made it more difficult to access the markets obtain financing on favorable terms and fund our operations The impact of government incentives on Fords business could be significant and Fords receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction termination or clawback We receive economic benefits from national state and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish maintain or increase investment workforce or production These incentives may take various forms including grants loan subsidies or tax abatements or credits The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period A decrease in expiration without renewal of or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units as a result of administrative decision or otherwise could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations Until 2021 most of our manufacturing facilities in South America were located in Brazil where the state or federal governments historically offered significant incentives to manufacturers to encourage capital investment increase manufacturing production and create jobs As a result the performance of our South American operations had been impacted favorably by government incentives to a substantial extent The federal government in Brazil has levied assessments against us concerning the federal incentives we previously received and the State of SÃ£o Paulo has challenged the grant to us of tax incentives by the State of Bahia See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for discussion of our accounting for government incentives and Item 3 Legal Proceedings for a discussion of tax proceedings in Brazil and the potential requirement for us to post collateral 23 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued The US Inflation Reduction Act IRA provides among other things financial incentives in the form of tax credits to grow the domestic supply chain and domestic manufacturing base for electric vehicles plugin hybrid vehicles PHEVs and other clean vehicles The law likewise incentivizes the purchase of clean vehicles and the infrastructure to fuel them These incentives are phasing in and will remain in effect until approximately 2032 unless modified by Congress The IRAs incentives are having and are expected to have material impacts on the automotive industry and Ford The IRA authorizes tax credits to manufacturers for the domestic production of batteries and battery components for EVs and PHEVs and to purchasers of qualified commercial and retail clean vehicles Ford expects that many customers will be able to monetize the commercial clean vehicle credit in light of Fords range of electrified product offerings for commercial applications When paired with the IRAs tax credit for the construction of certain electric vehicle charging infrastructure Ford expects the commercial clean vehicle credit will significantly influence commercial fleets in their evaluation of a transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs and PHEVs To claim the retail tax credit the IRA establishes numerous and complex prerequisites including that the vehicle must be assembled in North America the vehicle must be under specified limitations on manufacturer suggested retail price MSRP purchaser income limitations starting in 2024 any vehicle that contains battery components that were manufactured or assembled by a foreign entity of concern will be ineligible and starting in 2025 any vehicle that contains battery materials that were extracted processed or recycled by a foreign entity of concern will be ineligible A Critical Minerals Credit is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of critical minerals that are extracted or produced in the United States in a country with which the United States has a Free Trade Agreement or that is recycled in North America A Battery Components Credit is available for those vehicles that have a specified percentage of value of its battery components that are manufactured or assembled in North America Although we ultimately expect the IRA to benefit Ford and the automotive industry in general the availability of such benefits will depend on the further development and improvement of the US battery supply sufficient access to raw materials within the scope of the IRA and the terms of the regulations and guidance and the limitations therein the US government issues to implement the IRA which will ultimately determine which vehicles qualify for incentives and the amount thereof For example in late 2022 interim guidance was released on how to apply the MSRP limitations to the retail clean vehicle credit and subjected a significant number of SUVs to a lower MSRP limitation than the industry expected thereby excluding vehicles that may otherwise be eligible for the credit Automakers that better optimize eligibility for their vehicles as compared to their competition will have a competitive advantage Ford Credit could experience higherthanexpected credit losses lowerthananticipated residual values or higherthanexpected return volumes for leased vehicles Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customers or dealers failure to make payments according to contract terms Credit risk which is heavily dependent upon economic factors including unemployment consumer debt service burden personal income growth dealer profitability and used car prices has a significant impact on Ford Credits business The level of credit losses Ford Credit may experience could exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations In addition Ford Credit projects expected residual values including residual value support payments from Ford and return volumes for the vehicles it leases Actual proceeds realized by Ford Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected which would reduce Ford Credits return on the lease transaction Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease vehicles are the volume and mix of vehicles returned industrywide economic conditions marketing programs and quality or perceived quality safety fuel efficiency or reliability of the vehicles or changes in propulsion technology and related legislative changes Actual return volumes may be influenced by these factors as well as by contractual leaseend values relative to auction values In 2022 Ford Credit experienced lowerthanexpected return volumes If auction values decrease significantly in the future return volumes could exceed Ford Credits expectations Each of these factors alone or in combination has the potential to adversely affect Ford Credits results of operations if actual results were to differ significantly from Ford Credits projections See Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 for additional discussion Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans eg discount rates or investment returns could be worse than Ford has assumed The measurement of our obligations costs and liabilities associated with benefits pursuant to our pension and OPEB plans requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants We use many assumptions in calculating these estimates including assumptions related to discount rates investment returns on designated plan assets and demographic experience eg mortality and retirement rates We generally remeasure these estimates at each year end and recognize any gains or losses associated with changes to our plan assets and liabilities in the year incurred To the extent actual results are less favorable than our assumptions we may recognize a remeasurement loss in our results which could be substantial For additional information regarding our assumptions see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements 24 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Fords liquidity and financial condition We have defined benefit retirement plans in the United States that cover many of our hourly and salaried employees We also provide pension benefits to nonUS employees and retirees primarily in Europe In addition we sponsor plans to provide OPEB for retired employees primarily health care and life insurance benefits See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information about these plans These benefit plans impose significant liabilities on us and could require us to make additional cash contributions which could impair our liquidity If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to meet any pension or OPEB obligations we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures suspend dividend payments seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness Legal and Regulatory Risks Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation governmental investigations or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products services perceived environmental impacts or otherwise We spend substantial resources to comply with governmental safety regulations mobile and stationary source emissions regulations consumer and automotive financial regulations and other standards but we cannot ensure that employees or other individuals affiliated with us will not violate such laws or regulations In addition as discussed below under Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety emissions fuel economy autonomous driving technology environmental and other regulations and Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations consumer protection regulations or other regulations regulatory standards and interpretations may change on short notice and impact our compliance status Government investigations against Ford or Ford Credit could result in fines penalties or orders that could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or the operation of our business Moreover compliance with governmental standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits which can entail significant cost and risk In certain circumstances courts may permit civil actions even where our vehicles services and financial products comply with federal andor other applicable law Furthermore simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards whether related to our products services or business or commercial relationships requires significant expenditures of time and other resources Litigation also is inherently uncertain and we could experience significant adverse results including compensatory and punitive damage awards a disgorgement of profits or revenue or injunctive relief any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or our business in general In addition adverse publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could have a significant adverse effect on our sales Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety emissions fuel economy autonomous driving technology environmental and other regulations The automotive industry is subject to regulations worldwide that govern product characteristics and that differ by global region country and sometimes within national boundaries Further additional and new regulations continue to be proposed to address concerns regarding the environment including concerns about global climate change and its impact vehicle safety and energy independence and the regulatory landscape can change on short notice These regulations vary but generally require that over time motor vehicles and engines emit less air pollution including greenhouse gas emissions oxides of nitrogen hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and particulate matter Similarly we are making substantial investments in our facilities and revising our processes to not only comply with applicable regulations but also to make our operations more efficient and sustainable As our suppliers make similar investments those higher costs may be passed on to us In the United States legal and policy debates on environmental regulations are continuing with a primary trend toward reducing GHG emissions and increasing vehicle electrification Recently different federal administrations have either sought to make standards more strict or to make them less strict with one administration often replacing the regulations enacted by the last Various third parties routinely seek judicial review of these federal regulatory and deregulatory efforts In parallel California continues to enact increasingly strict emissions standards and requirements for zero emission vehicles and those actions are also the subject of legal challenges from third parties Court rulings regarding regulatory actions by federal California and other state regulators create uncertainty and the potential for applicable regulatory standards to change quickly In addition many governments regulate local product content andor impose import requirements with the aim of creating jobs protecting domestic producers and influencing the balance of payments 25 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued We are continuing to make changes to our product cycle plan to improve the fuel economy of our petroleumpowered vehicles and to offer more propulsion choices such as electrified vehicles with lower GHG emissions Electrification is our core strategy to comply with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations in major markets However there are limits on our ability to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy over a given time frame and many factors are involved that could delay or impede our plans primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies consumer acceptance of new technologies and changes in vehicle mix as described in more detail above under Fords new and existing products and digital software and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies the appropriateness or lack thereof of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles the widespread availability or lack thereof of supporting infrastructure for new technologies including charging for electric vehicles the availability or lack thereof of the raw materials and component supply to make batteries and other elements of electric vehicles and the human engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time If fuel prices are relatively low and market conditions do not drive consumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuelefficient vehicles in large numbers it may be difficult to meet applicable environmental standards without compromising results Moreover a production disruption stop ship limited availability of necessary components eg batteries or the raw materials necessary for their production lower than planned market acceptance of our vehicles or other intervening events may cause us to modify our product plans or in some cases purchase credits in order to comply with standards regarding fuel economy and air pollution which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations andor cause reputational harm Increased scrutiny of automaker emission compliance by regulators around the world has led to new regulations more stringent enforcement programs additional field actions demands for reporting on the field performance of emissions components and higher scrutiny of field data andor delays in regulatory approvals The cost to comply with existing government regulations in addition to the cost of any field service actions that may result from regulatory actions is substantial and additional regulations changes in regulatory interpretations or changes in consumer preferences that affect vehicle mix as well as a noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations In addition a number of governments as well as nongovernmental organizations publicly assess vehicles to their own protocols The protocols could change and any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicles subjected to such tests could reduce future sales Court decisions arising out of consumer and investor litigation could give rise to de facto changes in the interpretation of existing emission laws and regulations thereby imposing new burdens on manufacturers For more discussion of the impact of standards on our global business see the Governmental Standards discussion in Item 1 Business above We and other companies continue to develop autonomous vehicle technologies and the US and foreign governments are continuing to develop the regulatory framework that will govern autonomous vehicles The evolution of the regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles and the pace of the development of such regulatory framework may subject us to increased costs and uncertainty and may ultimately impact our ability to deliver autonomous vehicles and related services that customers want Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy data use and data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information We are subject to laws rules guidelines from privacy regulators and regulations in the United States and other countries such as the European Unions and the UKs General Data Protection Regulations and the California Consumer Privacy Act relating to the collection use crossborder data transfer and security of personal information of consumers employees or others including laws that may require us to notify regulators and affected individuals of a data security incident Existing and newly developed laws and regulations may contain broad definitions of personal information are subject to change and uncertain interpretations by courts and regulators and may be inconsistent from state to state or country to country Accordingly complying with such laws and regulations may lead to a decline in consumer engagement or cause us to incur substantial costs to modify our operations or business practices Moreover regulatory actions seeking to impose significant financial penalties for noncompliance andor legal actions including pursuant to laws providing for private rights of action by consumers could be brought against us in the event of a data compromise misuse of consumer information or perceived or actual noncompliance with data protection or privacy requirements Further any unauthorized release of personal information could harm our reputation disrupt our business cause us to expend significant resources and lead to a loss of consumer confidence resulting in an adverse impact on our business andor consumers deciding to withhold or withdraw consent for our collection or use of data 26 Item 1A Risk Factors Continued Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations consumer protection regulations or other regulations As a finance company Ford Credit is highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations in which it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business In the United States for example Ford Credits operations are subject to regulation and supervision under various federal state and local laws including the federal TruthinLending Act Consumer Leasing Act Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act The DoddFrank Act directs federal agencies to adopt rules to regulate the finance industry and the capital markets and gives the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB broad rulemaking and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that regulate consumer finance businesses such as Ford Credits automotive financing business Exercise of these powers by the CFPB may increase the costs of impose additional restrictions on or otherwise adversely affect companies in the automotive finance business The CFPB has authority to supervise and examine the largest nonbank automotive finance companies such as Ford Credit for compliance with consumer financial protection laws Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject Ford Credit to regulatory enforcement actions including consent orders or similar orders where Ford Credit may be required to revise practices remunerate customers or pay fines An enforcement action against Ford Credit could harm Ford Credits reputation or lead to further litigation ITEM 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None 27 ITEM 2 Properties Our principal properties include manufacturing and assembly facilities distribution centers warehouses sales or administrative offices and engineering centers We own substantially all of our US

above are in the opinion of management suitable and adequate for the manufacture and assembly of our and our joint ventures products The furniture equipment and other physical property owned by our Ford Credit operations are not material in relation to the operations total assets ITEM 3 Legal Proceedings The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a discussion of loss contingencies Following is a discussion of our significant pending legal proceedings PRODUCT LIABILITY MATTERS We are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts within and outside of the United States alleging damages from injuries resulting from or aggravated by alleged defects in our vehicles In many actions no monetary amount of damages is specified or the specific amount alleged is the jurisdictional minimum Our experience with litigation alleging a specific amount of damages suggests that such amounts on average bear little relation to the actual amount of damages if any that we will pay in resolving such matters In addition to pending actions we assess the likelihood of incidents that likely have occurred but not yet been reported to us We also take into consideration specific matters that have been raised as claims but have not yet proceeded to litigation Individual product liability matters that have more than a remote risk of loss and such loss would likely be significant if the matter is resolved unfavorably to us would be described herein Currently there are no such matters to report Below is a product liability matter currently pending against Ford Hill v Ford Plaintiffs in this product liability action pending in Georgia state court allege that the roof of a 2002 Ford F250 involved in a rollover accident was defectively designed During the first trial in 2018 the judge declared a mistrial ruled that Fords attorneys had violated pretrial rulings while presenting evidence and sanctioned Ford by prohibiting Ford from introducing any evidence at the second trial to show that the roof design of the F250 was not defective During the second trial in August 2022 a jury found that Pep Boys the party that sold the tires on the vehicle involved in the rollover accident was responsible for 30 of the damages and Ford as a direct result of the sanctions order prohibiting Ford from presenting its defense was responsible for 70 of the damages resulting in 168 million in damages being apportioned to Ford The jury subsequently awarded punitive damages against Ford in the amount of 17 billion We have filed posttrial motions and are seeking a new trial A hearing on our posttrial motions was held on December 19 2022 and we believe the law supports our position that Ford is entitled to a new trial with the right to present evidence in its defense 29 Item 3 Legal Proceedings Continued ASBESTOS MATTERS Asbestos was used in some brakes clutches and other automotive components from the early 1900s Along with other vehicle manufacturers we have been the target of asbestos litigation and as a result are a defendant in various actions for injuries claimed to have resulted from alleged exposure to Ford parts and other products containing asbestos Plaintiffs in these personal injury cases allege various health problems as a result of asbestos exposure either from component parts found in older vehicles insulation or other asbestos products in our facilities or asbestos aboard our former maritime fleet We believe that we are targeted more aggressively in asbestos suits because many previously targeted companies have filed for bankruptcy or emerged from bankruptcy relieved of liability for such claims Most of the asbestos litigation we face involves individuals who claim to have worked on the brakes of our vehicles We are prepared to defend these cases and believe that the scientific evidence confirms our longstanding position that there is no increased risk of asbestosrelated disease as a result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the brakes on our vehicles The extent of our financial exposure to asbestos litigation remains very difficult to estimate and could include both compensatory and punitive damage awards The majority of our asbestos cases do not specify a dollar amount for damages in many of the other cases the dollar amount specified is the jurisdictional minimum and the vast majority of these cases involve multiple defendants Some of these cases may also involve multiple plaintiffs and we may be unable to tell from the pleadings which plaintiffs are making claims against us as opposed to other defendants Annual payout and defense costs may become significant in the future Our accrual for asbestos matters includes probable losses for both asserted and unasserted claims CONSUMER MATTERS We provide warranties on the vehicles we sell Warranties are offered for specific periods of time andor mileage and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale Pursuant to these warranties we will repair replace or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factorysupplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period We are a defendant in numerous actions in state and federal courts alleging breach of warranty and claiming damages based on state and federal consumer protection laws Remedies under these statutes may include vehicle repurchase civil penalties and payment by Ford of the plaintiffs attorneys fees In some cases plaintiffs also include an allegation of fraud Remedies for a fraud claim may include contract rescission vehicle repurchase and punitive damages The cost of these litigation matters is included in our warranty costs We accrue obligations for warranty costs at the time of sale using a patterned estimation model that includes historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis We are currently a defendant in a significant number of litigation matters relating to the performance of vehicles including those equipped with DPS6 transmissions ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We have received notices under various federal and state environmental laws that we along with others are or may be a potentially responsible party for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage recycling or disposal sites in many states and in some instances for natural resource damages We also may have been a generator of hazardous substances at a number of other sites The amount of any such costs or damages for which we may be held responsible could be significant Any legal proceeding arising under any federal state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment in which i a governmental authority is a party and ii we believe there is the possibility of monetary sanctions exclusive of interest and costs in excess of 1000000 is described herein On June 16 2022 the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection NJDEP filed a complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey Bergen County seeking natural resource damages and other claims related to the Ringwood MinesLandfill Site located in Ringwood New Jersey We are defending the NJDEPs allegations and have filed a motion to dismiss 30 Item 3 Legal Proceedings Continued CLASS ACTIONS In light of the fact that few of the purported class actions filed against us in the past have been certified by the courts as class actions in general we list those actions that i have been certified as a class action by a court of competent jurisdiction and any additional purported class actions that raise allegations substantially similar to an existing and certified class and ii have more than a remote risk of loss and such loss would likely be significant if the action is resolved unfavorably to us At this time we have no such class actions filed against us OTHER MATTERS Brazilian Tax Matters One Brazilian state SÃ£o Paulo and the Brazilian federal tax authority currently have outstanding substantial tax assessments against Ford Motor Company Brasil Ltda Ford Brazil related to state and federal tax incentives Ford Brazil received for its operations in the Brazilian state of Bahia The SÃ£o Paulo assessment is part of a broader conflict among various states in Brazil The federal legislature enacted laws designed to encourage the states to end that conflict and in 2017 the states reached an agreement on a framework for resolution Ford Brazil continues to pursue a resolution under the framework and expects the amount of any remaining assessments by the states to be resolved under that framework The federal assessments are outside the scope of the legislation All of the outstanding assessments have been appealed to the relevant administrative court of each jurisdiction To proceed with an appeal within the judicial court system an appellant may be required to post collateral To date we have not been required to post any collateral If we are required to post collateral which could be in excess of 1 billion we expect it to be in the form of fixed assets surety bonds andor letters of credit but we may be required to post cash collateral Although the ultimate resolution of these matters may take many years we consider our overall risk of loss to be remote Transit Connect Customs Penalty Notice US Customs and Border Protection CBP ruled in 2013 that Transit Connects imported as passenger wagons and later converted into cargo vans are subject to the 25 duty applicable to cargo vehicles rather than the 25 duty applicable to passenger vehicles We filed a challenge in the US Court of International Trade CIT and CIT ruled in our favor in 2017 CBP subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which ruled in favor of CBP Following the US Supreme Courts denial of our petition for a writ of certiorari in 2020 we paid the increased duties for certain prior imports plus interest and disclosed that CBP might assert a claim for penalties Subsequently CBP issued a penalty notice to us dated July 22 2021 and on November 18 2021 CBP assessed against us a monetary penalty of 13 billion and additional duties of 181 million plus interest We intend to vigorously defend our actions and contest payment of the penalty and the additional duties European Commission and UK Competition and Markets Authority Matter On March 15 2022 the European Commission the Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority the CMA conducted unannounced inspections at the premises of and sent formal requests for information to several companies and associations active in the automotive sector including Ford The inspections and requests for information concern possible collusion in relation to the collection treatment and recovery of endoflife cars and vans ELVs We understand that the scope of the investigations includes determining whether manufacturers and importers of passenger cars and vans agreed to an approach to i the compensation of ELV collection treatment and recovery companies and ii the use of data relating to the recyclability or recoverability of ELVs in marketing materials and whether such conduct violates relevant competition laws If a violation is found a broad range of remedies is potentially available to the Commission andor CMA including imposing a fine andor the prohibition or restriction of certain business practices Given that this investigation is in its early stages it is difficult to predict the outcome or what remedies if any may be imposed We are cooperating with the Commission and the CMA as they complete their investigations ITEM 4 Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable 31 ITEM 4A Executive Officers of Ford Our executive officers are as follows along with each executive

and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry COVID19 and Supplier Disruptions The impact of COVID19 including changes in consumer behavior pandemic fears and market downturns and restrictions on business and individual activities has created significant volatility in the global economy Outbreaks in certain regions continue to cause intermittent COVID19related disruptions in our supply chain and local manufacturing operations We also continue to face supplier disruptions due to labor shortages and other production issues in addition to the continuing semiconductor shortage Our inconsistent production schedule has been disruptive to our suppliers operations which in turn has led to higher costs and production shortfalls Further actions taken by Russia in Ukraine have impacted and could further impact our suppliers particularly our lower tier suppliers as well as our operations in Europe For additional information on the impact of supplier disruptions see the Outlook section on page 73 Currency Exchange Rate Volatility After aggressively easing monetary policy in response to the COVID19 pandemic the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world in 2022 began to withdraw monetary stimulus by raising interest rates Periods of monetary policy tightening are often associated with heightened financial market and currency volatility especially for those markets that are outliers in terms of their economic or monetary policy backdrop This is notable for many emerging markets which may also face increased exposure to commodity prices and political instability contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates In addition to direct impacts on the financial flows of global automotive companies currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets In most markets exchange rates are marketdetermined and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors and thus likely to remain volatile However in some markets exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments Pricing Pressure Over the last year prices of both new and used vehicles have increased substantially due to strong demand supply shortages and inflationary costs We have already observed some moderation in the rate of price increases as auto production slowly recovers from the semiconductor shortage but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to preCOVID19 pandemic levels Over the long term intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflationadjusted prices for similarlycontented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets Commodity and Energy Prices Prices for commodities remain volatile In some cases spot prices for various commodities have recently diverged somewhat as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum while precious metals eg palladium and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric vehicles eg lithium cobalt nickel graphite and manganese among other materials for batteries remain high The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall To help ensure supply of raw materials for critical components eg batteries we like others in the industry have entered into multiyear sourcing agreements and may enter into additional agreements Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets with Europe particularly exposed to the risk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine Such shortages may impact facilities operated by us or our suppliers which could have an impact on us in Europe and other regions In the long term the outcome of decarbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil demand but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing volatility of oil and other energy prices For additional information on commodity costs see the Outlook section on page 73 Vehicle Profitability Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell which may vary significantly by vehicle line In general larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles both across and within vehicle segments For example in North America our larger more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 120 of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins In addition government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency eg ZEV mandates and low emission zones and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins 35 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Trade Policy To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports such as erecting tariff or nontariff barriers or manipulating their currency and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global marketplace there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets While we believe the longterm trend will support the growth of free trade we will continue to monitor and address developing issues Inflation and Interest Rates We continue to see nearterm impacts on our business due to inflation including ongoing global price pressures in the wake of Russias invasion of Ukraine driving up energy prices freight premiums and other operating costs above normal rates Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike core inflation excluding food and energy prices remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets Accordingly the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt tighter monetary policy and potentially higher longterm interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business At Ford Credit rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates which could reduce its financing margin Revenue Our Automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles parts and accessories Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers generally our dealers and distributors For the majority of sales this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities However we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or standready performance obligation such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations revenue related to other future or standready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase for a guaranteed amount exercisable at the option of the customer are accounted for as operating leases with lease revenue recognized over the term of the lease Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealers purchase of a vehicle Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Automotive legal entity in payment of the dealers obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer Our Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from operating leases Revenue from interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain deferred origination costs Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the lease Transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments occur in the ordinary course of business For example we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealers customer Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments 36 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Costs and Expenses Our income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories i cost of sales and ii selling administrative and other expenses We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development production and distribution of our vehicles parts accessories and services Specifically we include in cost of sales each of the following material costs including commodity costs freight costs warranty including product recall costs labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity parts accessories and services depreciation and amortization and other associated costs We include within selling administrative and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles parts accessories and services including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs Certain of our costs such as material costs generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production In our industry production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel As a result we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant presentyear volume and mix and currency exchange in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels We analyze these cost changes in the following categories Contribution Costs these costs typically vary with production volume These costs include material including commodity warranty and freight and duty costs Structural Costs these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume These costs include manufacturing vehicle and software engineering spendingrelated advertising and sales promotion administrative information technology and selling and pension and OPEB costs While contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs For example depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions On the other hand while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume for example when we increase overtime add a production shift or add personnel to support volume increases Other structural costs such as advertising or engineering costs do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume Our structural costs generally are within our discretion although to varying degrees and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors We consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue For example structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability invest in new products and technologies respond to increasing industry sales volume and grow our market share Cost of sales and Selling administrative and other expenses for full year 2022 were 1453 billion Our Automotive segments material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses followed by structural costs Although material costs are our largest absolute cost our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs 37 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of

Operations Continued Definitions and Information Regarding Automotive Causal Factors In general we measure yearoveryear change in Automotive segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below with net pricing and cost variances calculated at presentyear volume and mix and exchange Market Factors exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units Volume and Mix primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes at prioryear average contribution margin per unit driven by changes in industry volume market share and dealer stocks as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line Net Pricing primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs lowrate financing offers special lease offers and stock adjustments on dealer inventory Cost Contribution Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by perunit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume such as material costs including commodity and component costs warranty expense and freight and duty costs Structural Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume Structural costs include the following cost categories Manufacturing Including VolumeRelated consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel plant overhead such as utilities and taxes and new product launch expense These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime linespeed and shift schedules Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel prototype materials testing and outside engineering and software services SpendingRelated consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets but also includes asset retirements and operating leases Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising marketing programs brand promotions customer mailings and promotional events and auto shows Administrative Information Technology and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities information technology and selling functions Pension and OPEB consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit costs Exchange

Operations Continued Mobility Segment The Mobility segment primarily includes development costs for Fords autonomous vehicles and related businesses Fords equity ownership in Argo AI a developer of autonomous driving systems and other mobility businesses and investments In our Mobility segment our 2022 EBIT loss improved 104 million from a year ago The 926 million EBIT loss reflects our strategic investments in our autonomous vehicle capabilities and support of our mobility initiatives In the third quarter of 2022 we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from L4 technology being developed by Argo AI to advanced L2L3 systems which we believe will ultimately be essential to achieve profitable commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale in the future Additionally because of the significant additional capital and time required to achieve commercialization of L4 as well as other macroeconomic factors Argo AI has been unable to attract new investors After performing external outreach in the third quarter to assess market interest in acquiring either Argo AI or its technology components and conducting internal reviews to evaluate opportunities to leverage Argo AIs technology Ford determined that Argo AI no longer has value as a going concern As a result we reassessed the carrying value of our investment in Argo AI starting from September 30 2022 and in October Ford and VW initiated the process of exiting the joint development of L4 technology through Argo AI Accordingly in the second half of 2022 we recorded as a special item a 27 billion pretax impairment on our Argo AI investment and on October 26 2022 we announced that Argo AI plans to wind down operations which is in progress 46 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of

stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values Ford Credits US 36month auction values for offlease vehicles were up 8 from a year ago reflecting strong demand for used vehicles including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage We are planning for full year 2023 auction values to decrease as supply constraints improve Ford Credits 2022 EBT of 2657 million was 2060 million lower than a year ago reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases lower financing margin and lower lease return rates 47 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors In general we measure yearoveryear changes in Ford Credits EBT using the causal factors listed below Volume and Mix Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield defined below in financing margin at prior period exchange rates Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing the sales price of the vehicles financed the level of dealer inventories Fordsponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit and the availability of costeffective funding Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by periodoverperiod changes in the composition of Ford Credits average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region Financing Margin Financing margin variance is the periodtoperiod change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated Financing margin yield equals revenue less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates cost assumptions in pricing mix of business and competitive environment Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates borrowing spreads and assetliability management Credit Loss Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates For analysis purposes management splits the provision for credit losses into net chargeoffs and the change in the allowance for credit losses Net chargeoff changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions severity per repossession and recoveries Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries changes in the composition and size of Ford Credits present portfolio changes in trends in historical used vehicle values and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions For additional information refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10K Report Lease Residual Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates For analysis purposes management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation of the vehicles sold Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credits estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term and changes in Ford Credits estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events For additional information refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10K Report Exchange Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to US dollars Other Primarily includes operating expenses other revenue insurance expenses and other incomeloss at prior period exchange rates Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs facilities costs and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts In general other incomeloss changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives primarily related to movements in interest rates and other miscellaneous items 48 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued In addition the following

reflecting lower wholesale receivables as a result of lower dealer inventories due to the semiconductor shortage Ford Credits loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values Ford Credits US 36month auction values for offlease vehicles were up 26 from 2020 reflecting strong demand for used vehicles including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage Ford Credits 2021 EBT increased 2109 million from 2020 explained primarily by favorable operating lease residual performance the nonrecurrence of the 2020 increase to the credit loss reserve due to deterioration in macroeconomic conditions related to COVID19 and reductions in the credit loss reserve in 2021 partially offset by lower volume driven by the impact of the global semiconductor shortage and lower financing margin 58 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Corporate Other For full year 2021 Corporate Other had a 1084 million loss compared with a 726 million loss in 2020 The higher loss was driven by lower interest income and higher administrative and ITrelated expenses Interest on Debt Our full year 2021 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1803 million 154 million higher than in 2020 primarily explained by higher US unsecured debt interest expense Taxes Our Provision forBenefit from income taxes for full year 2021 was a 130 million benefit resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 07 This includes a benefit of 29 billion to recognize deferred tax assets resulting from changes in our global tax structure and a 918 million benefit from the reversal of US valuation allowances Our full year 2021 adjusted effective tax rate which excludes special

December 31 2022 we had Company cash of 323 billion and liquidity of 480 billion including approximately 194 million of Rivian marketable securities In 2022 we sold approximately 91 million of our Rivian shares resulting in proceeds of about 3 billion As marketable securities increase or decrease in value Company cash and liquidity will likewise increase or decrease At December 31 2022 about 89 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States To be prepared for an economic downturn we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to i future cash flow expectations such as for investments in future opportunities capital investments debt maturities pension contributions or restructuring requirements ii shortterm timing differences and iii changes in the global economic environment Our Company cash investments excluding the Rivian marketable securities primarily include US Department of Treasury obligations federal agency securities bank time deposits with investmentgrade

repurchase program including share repurchases to offset the antidilutive effect of increased sharedbased compensation may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash Moreover we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events eg legal contingencies uncertain tax positions and other matters We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties and as noted above such commitments require a material amount of cash Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Ford Credit segment In addition as part of our normal business practices we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials components and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services These arrangements including multiyear offtake commitments may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements Purchase obligations in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below are defined as offbalance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms however as we purchase raw materials and components beyond the minimum amounts required by the Purchase obligations our material cash requirements for these items are higher than what is reflected in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table For additional information on the timing of these payments and the impact on our working capital see the Changes in Company Cash section below

agreements which are subject to satisfaction of the conditions in the agreements total about 24 billion through 2029 based on our present pricing forecast however our forecasted prices could fluctuate significantly from period to period which would result in volatility in the estimate of our overall obligation In addition we plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers the costs under which we expect to be significant We plan to utilize our liquidity as described above and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements Changes in Company Cash In managing our business we classify changes in Company cash into operating and nonoperating items Operating items include Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT capital spending depreciation and tooling amortization changes in working capital Ford Credit distributions interest on debt cash taxes and all other and timing differences including timing differences between accrualbased EBIT and associated cash flows Nonoperating items include global redesign including separation payments changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit contributions to funded pension plans shareholder distributions and other items including gains and losses on investments in equity securities acquisitions and divestitures equity investments and other transactions with Ford Credit 62 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued With respect to Changes in working capital in general we carry relatively low Automotive segment trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our Automotive wholesales are financed primarily by Ford Credit immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers which generally occurs shortly after being produced In contrast our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industrystandard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days As a result our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes and the corresponding revenue decrease while trade payables continue to become due Conversely our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes and the corresponding revenue increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days For example the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to preCOVID19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow Even in normal economic conditions however these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow For example we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes are usually at their lowest levels while payables continue to come due and be paid The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods Our finished product inventory at December 31 2022 was higher year over year due to production and release scheduling which resulted in higher sales inventory intransit inventory and units awaiting upfit In response to or in anticipation of supplier disruptions we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles Such actions could have a shortterm adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory Moreover in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers including contributing up to 66 billion in capital to BlueOval SK LLC over a fiveyear period ending in 2026 Such investments which are part of our plan to invest over 50 billion in electric vehicles through 2026 could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the nearterm The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into and those we may enter into in the future vary by transaction though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials such as quality or minimum output Subject to satisfaction of those conditions we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions will be in 2024 Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers at their sole discretion to sell their Ford receivables ie our payment obligations to the suppliers to the financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms the amounts we pay or our liquidity We have no economic interest in a suppliers decision to participate in the SCF program and we have no direct financial relationship with the SCF financial institutions Moreover we do not provide any guarantees in connection with the SCF program As of December 31 2022 the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 253 million The amount settled through the SCF program during 2022 was 14 billion 63 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Changes in

expected prepayments and allowance for credit losses of its finance receivables investment in operating leases and cash less the cumulative debt maturities over upcoming annual periods Ford Credits balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the shortterm nature of its finance receivables investment in operating leases and cash Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities This positive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded and is in addition to liquidity available to protect for stress scenarios The following table shows Ford Credits cumulative maturities for assets and total debt for the periods presented and unsecured longterm debt

investment in operating leases in the table above include expected prepayments for Ford Credits retail installment sale contracts and investment in operating leases The table above also reflects adjustments to debt maturities to match the assetbacked debt maturities with the underlying asset maturities All wholesale securitization transactions and wholesale receivables are shown maturing in the next 12 months even if the maturities extend beyond 2023 The retail securitization transactions under certain committed assetbacked facilities are assumed to amortize immediately rather than amortizing after the expiration of the commitment period As of December 31 2022 Ford Credit had 137 billion of assets 60 billion of which were unencumbered Funding and Liquidity Risks Ford Credits funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond its control including disruption in the capital markets that could impact both unsecured debt and assetbacked securities and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets Despite Ford Credits diverse sources of funding and liquidity its ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by among others the following factors not necessarily listed in order of importance or probability of occurrence Prolonged disruption of the debt and securitization markets Global capital market volatility Credit ratings assigned

Ford Credits ability to maintain credit facilities and committed assetbacked facilities Stress Tests Ford Credit regularly conducts stress testing on its funding and liquidity sources to ensure it can continue to meet financial obligations and support the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles during firmspecific and marketwide stress events Stress tests are intended to quantify the potential impact of various adverse scenarios on the balance sheet and liquidity These scenarios include assumptions on access to unsecured and secured debt markets runoff of shortterm funding and ability to renew expiring liquidity commitments and are measured over various time periods including 30 days 90 days and longer term Ford Credits stress test does not assume any additional funding liquidity or capital

the 02 billion underfunded status at yearend 2022 our funded plans were 41 billion overfunded and our unfunded plans were 43 billion underfunded These unfunded plans are pay as you go with benefits paid from Company cash and primarily include certain plans in Germany and US defined benefit plans for senior management The fixed income mix was 79 in both our US plans and nonUS plans at yearend 2022 In 2022 we contributed 567 million to our global funded pension plans a decrease of 206 million compared with 2021 During 2023 we expect to contribute between 500 million and 600 million of cash to our global funded pension plans We also expect to make about 400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans Based on current assumptions and regulations we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major US plans in 2023 Our global funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate demonstrating the effectiveness of our derisking strategy and our commitment to a strong balance sheet For a detailed discussion of our pension plans refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022

Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued CREDIT RATINGS Our shortterm and longterm debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission DBRS Fitch Moodys and SP In several markets locally recognized rating agencies also rate us A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency There have been no rating actions taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued OUTLOOK We provided 2023 Company guidance in our earnings release furnished on Form 8K dated February 2 2023 The guidance is based on our expectations as of February 2 2023 Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks uncertainties and other factors including those set forth in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I 2023 Guidance Total Company Adjusted EBIT a 9 11 billion Adjusted Free Cash Flow a About 6 billion Capital spending 8 9 billion Ford Credit EBT About 13 billion __________ a When we provide guidance for Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Free Cash Flow we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures because as described in more detail below in NonGAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures they include items that are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty For fullyear 2023 we expect adjusted EBIT of 9 billion to 11 billion which assumes a seasonally adjusted annual rate SAAR of about 15 million in the United States and about 13 million in Europe We also expect adjusted free cash flow of about 6 billion which assumes no distributions from Ford Credit Our outlook for 2023 assumes the headwinds and tailwinds below Headwinds An expected mild US recession and a moderate recession in Europe Higher incentives across the industry as supply and demand come back into balance Ford Credit EBT of about 13 billion down about 14 billion reflecting unfavorable lease residuals and credit losses and the nonrecurrence of derivative gains Continuation of the strong dollar About 2 billion lower past service pension income Continued investments in growth including in customer experience connected services and capital expenditures Tailwinds Improvement in the supply chain and industry volume Launch of our allnew Super Duty Lower cost of goods sold including efficiencies in materials commodities logistics and other parts of our industrial

results to differ materially from those stated including without limitation Ford and Ford Credits financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by public health issues including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID19 Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Fords production schedule and specifications and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components such as semiconductors or raw materials such as lithium cobalt nickel graphite and manganese can disrupt Fords production of vehicles To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles Ford has entered into and expects to continue to enter into multiyear commitments to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast Fords longterm competitiveness depends on the

competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced Fords results are dependent on sales of larger more profitable vehicles particularly in the United States With a global footprint Fords results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs or other events Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis recession or significant geopolitical event Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity currency fluctuations competitive actions or other factors Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and market value of Ford or Ford Credits investments including marketable

Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued NONGAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and nonGAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making and to assess Company and segment business performance The nonGAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures to aid investors in better understanding our financial results We believe that these nonGAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends and a means to compare our periodoverperiod results These nonGAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP These nonGAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted Company Adjusted EBIT Most Comparable GAAP Measure Net IncomeLoss Attributable to Ford Earnings before interest and taxes EBIT excludes interest on debt excl Ford Credit Debt taxes and pretax special items This nonGAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends and improves comparability of our periodoverperiod results Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources Our categories of pretax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action are as follows PreTax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses dealerrelated costs and facilityrelated charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions generally 100 million or more for other items When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities Company Adjusted EBIT Margin Most Comparable GAAP Measure Company Net IncomeLoss Margin Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue This nonGAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting Adjusted EarningsLoss Per Share Most Comparable GAAP Measure EarningsLoss Per Share Measure of Companys diluted net earningsloss per share adjusted for impact of pretax special items described above tax special items and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities When we provide guidance for adjusted earningsloss per share we do not provide guidance on an earningsloss per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to yearend including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Most Comparable GAAP Measure Effective Tax Rate Measure of Companys tax rate excluding pretax special items described above and tax special items The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to yearend including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses 76 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow Most Comparable GAAP Measure Net Cash Provided ByUsed In Operating Activities Measure of Companys operating cash flow excluding Ford Credits operating cash flows The measure contains elements management considers operating activities including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending Ford Credit distributions to its parent and settlement of derivatives The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions global redesign including separations and other items that are considered operating cash flows under US GAAP This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with managements assessment of the Companys operating cash flow performance When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow we do not provide guidance for net cash provided byused in operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty including cash

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1 the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors In addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements Warranties and Field Service Actions Nature of Estimates Required We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time andor mileage which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale Separately we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls emission recalls and other product campaigns Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions we will repair replace or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factorysupplied materials or workmanship We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale In addition from time to time we issue extended warranties at our expense the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance Assumptions and Approach Used We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model We use historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile therefore our process relies on longterm historical averages until sufficient data are available With actual experience we use the data to update the historical averages We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations Based on this data we update our estimates as necessary Field service actions may occur in periods beyond the base warranty coverage period We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model We use historical information regarding the nature frequency severity and average cost of claims for each model year We assess our obligation for field service actions on a regular basis using actual claims experience and update our estimates as necessary Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors used in establishing our estimates changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and field service action costs Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits Nature of Estimates Required The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as demographic experience and health care cost increases Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed eg in existing labor contracts 84 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Assumptions and Approach Used The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors Discount rates Our discount rate assumptions are based primarily on the results of cash flow matching analyses which match the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on highquality bonds specific to the country of the plan Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the yearend obligations Expected longterm rate of return on plan assets Our expected longterm rate of return considers inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns inflation bond yields and other variables adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan Historical returns also are considered when appropriate The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs with a focus on longterm trends to avoid shortterm market influences Salary growth Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience longterm outlook and assumed inflation Inflation Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets Expected contributions Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements cash availability and other considerations eg funded status avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies and tax efficiency Retirement rates Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience Mortality rates Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience Health care cost trends Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends Assumptions are set at each yearend and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event such as a curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions Pension Plans Effect of Actual Results The yearend 2022 weighted average discount rate was 551 for US plans and 442 for nonUS plans reflecting increases of 260 and 267 basis points respectively compared with yearend 2021 In 2022 the US actual return on assets was negative 2120 which was lower than the expected longterm rate of return of 575 NonUS actual return on assets was negative 2540 which was lower than the expected longterm rate of return of 329 The lower returns are explained by losses on fixed income and growth assets both of which were consistent with broader market performance In total higher rates and pension asset losses in addition to demographic and other updates resulted in a net remeasurement loss of 13 billion which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item For 2023 the expected longterm rate of return on assets is 625 for US plans up 50 basis points from 2022 and 413 for nonUS plans up 84 basis points compared with a year ago reflecting higher nominal riskfree rates and a higher consensus on capital market return expectations from advisors Derisking Strategy We employ a broad derisking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves Changes in interest rates which directly influence changes in discount rates in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio Our derisking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio 85 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Sensitivity Analysis The December

for financial reporting purposes We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas i the calculation of tax credits ii the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax reporting and financial statement purposes as well as iii the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs 86 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Assumptions and Approach Used We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws regulations and various related judicial opinions If in our judgment it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than 50 that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably for us we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized This process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if based on all available evidence it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized This assessment which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis takes into account various types of evidence including the following Nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses A pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence We generally consider cumulative pretax losses in the threeyear period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability We also consider the strength and trend of earnings as well as other relevant factors In certain circumstances historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations Sources of future taxable income Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated Otherwise these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has not yet been achieved In such cases we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment and Tax planning strategies If necessary and available tax planning strategies could be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and depending on their nature could be heavily weighted In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider the tradeoffs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits During 2022 we reversed 405 million of US valuation allowances primarily as a result of planning actions We presently believe that global valuation allowances of 822 million are required and that we ultimately will recover the remaining 14 billion of deferred tax assets However the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is subject to a number of variables including our future profitability within relevant tax jurisdictions and future tax planning and the related effects on our cash and liquidity position Accordingly our valuation allowances may increase or decrease in future periods For additional information regarding income taxes see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements 87 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Impairment of LongLived Assets Asset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets Our asset groups presently are the regional Automotive business units ie North America South America Europe China including Taiwan and the International Markets Group Ford Credit and the separate legal entities within the Mobility segment Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting As a result of the new organizational and segment structure that will be implemented in 2023 our asset groups are expected to be Ford Blue North America Ford Blue Europe Ford Blue Rest of World Ford Model e Ford Pro Ford Credit and Ford Next formerly Mobility Nature of Estimates Required HeldandUsed LongLived Assets We test our longlived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses significant negative industry or economic trends including a substantial shift in consumer preference a current expectation that a longlived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition or when there is a change in the asset grouping In addition investing in new emerging products eg EVs or services eg connectivity may require substantial upfront investment which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term In these instances near term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment In such circumstances we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated confirming whether established milestones are being achieved and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred a test for recoverability is performed When a triggering event occurs a test for recoverability is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets the asset groups fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method To the extent available we will also consider thirdparty valuations of our longlived assets that were prepared for other business purposes An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life Nature of Estimates Required HeldforSale Operations We perform an impairment test on a disposal group to be discontinued held for sale or otherwise disposed of when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be completed within one year We estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received less cost to sell and compare it to the carrying value of the disposal group An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value Assumptions and Approach Used HeldandUsed LongLived Assets Fair value of an asset group is determined from the perspective of a marketparticipant considering among other things appropriate discount rates valuation techniques the most advantageous market and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group We measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices ie the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party when available When market prices are not available we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach andor the market approach The income approach uses cash flow projections Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results business plan forecasts expected growth rates and cost of capital similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and therefore can affect the test results The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections Business projections We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace These assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume mix and pricing We also make assumptions about our cost levels eg capacity utilization cost performance These projections are derived using our internal business plan forecasts that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our Board of Directors 88 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Longterm growth rate A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debtfree interim cash flows The growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset groups business units earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period Discount rate When measuring possible impairment future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weightedaverage cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use Weightedaverage cost of capital is an estimate of the overall riskadjusted pretax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise Economic projections Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for our vehicles These macroeconomic assumptions include but are not limited to industry sales volumes inflation interest rates prices of raw materials eg commodities and foreign currency exchange rates The market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group This approach relies on the market value ie market capitalization of companies that are engaged in the same or similar line of business as the reporting unit or asset group being evaluated In addition to the extent available we also consider thirdparty valuations that were prepared for other business purposes During 2022 we continued to progress our global redesign Against this backdrop we determined that there were triggering events related to our South America and International Markets Group IMG business units We also assessed our expected new 2023 asset groups which consist of Ford Blue North America Ford Blue Europe Ford Blue Rest of World Ford Model e Ford Pro Ford Credit and Ford Next and assessed these groups for triggering events and potential impairment We determined that the carrying values of the longlived assets were recoverable at December 31 2022 under our existing assets groups as well as under our anticipated 2023 asset groups If in future quarters our economic or business projections were to change as a result of our plans or changes in the economic or business environment there was a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or there was a current expectation that a longlived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life we would undertake additional testing as appropriate which could result in an impairment of longlived assets Assumptions and Approach Used HeldforSale Operations In the third quarter of 2022 we entered into an agreement to sell our Sanand India vehicle assembly and powertrain plants to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited Tata The sale transaction included the land buildings and other fixed assets excluding the powertrain machinery and equipment for the plants Accordingly we have reported 88 million of fixed assets for this operation as held for sale for the period ended December 31 2022 We recognized pretax impairment charges in Cost of sales of 32 million in the third quarter of 2022 to adjust the carrying value of the heldforsale assets to fair value less costs to sell We determined fair value using the market approach estimated based on the negotiated value of the assets On January 10 2023 we completed the sale of the plants to Tata See Note 22 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding heldforsale operations Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credits estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date The adequacy of Ford Credits allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly Because credit losses can vary substantially over time estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain Changes in assumptions affect Ford Credit interest operating and other expenses on our consolidated income statements and the allowance for credit losses contained within Ford Credit finance receivables net on our consolidated balance sheets See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses Nature of Estimates Required Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for receivables that share similar risk characteristics based on a collective assessment using a combination of measurement models and management judgment The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses recent portfolio performance and forwardlooking macroeconomic conditions The models vary by portfolio and receivable type including consumer finance receivables wholesale loans and dealer loans If Ford Credit does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty observable changes in portfolio performance and other relevant factors 89 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Assumptions Used Ford Credits allowance for credit losses is based on its assumptions regarding Probability of default The expected probability of payment and time to default which include assumptions about macroeconomic factors and recent performance and Loss given default The percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable The loss given default takes into account expected collateral value and future recoveries Macroeconomic factors used in Ford Credits models are country specific and include variables such as unemployment rates personal bankruptcy filings housing prices and gross domestic product Sensitivity Analysis Changes in the probability of default and loss given default assumptions would affect the allowance for credit losses The effect of the indicated increasedecrease in the assumptions for Ford Credits US Ford and Lincoln retail financing is as follows in millions Assumption Basis Point Change IncreaseDecrease Probability of default lifetime 100 bps 210210 Loss given default 100 1010 Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases Accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credits operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term Ford Credit monitors residual values each month and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credits revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term Adjustments to depreciation expense result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straightline basis Generally lease customers have the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer Nature of Estimates Required Each operating lease in Ford Credits portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values return volumes for its leased vehicles industrywide used vehicle prices marketing incentive plans and vehicle quality data Assumptions Used Ford Credits accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding Auction value Ford Credits projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease and Return volume Ford Credits projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at leaseend See Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases 90 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued Sensitivity Analysis For returned vehicles Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases however the impact may be tempered or exacerbated based on future auction values in relation to the purchase price specified in the lease contract A change in the assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credits estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract The effect of the indicated increasedecrease in the assumptions for Ford Credits US Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows in millions Assumption Basis Point Change IncreaseDecrease Future auction values 100 bps 1010 Return volumes 100 55 Adjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases are reflected on our balance sheets as Net investment in operating leases and on our income statements in Ford Credit interest operating and other expenses 91 Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Continued ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED For a discussion of recent accounting standards see Note 3 of the Notes to the Financial Statements 92 ITEM 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk OVERVIEW We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates as well as risks to availability of funding sources hazard events and specific asset risks These risks affect our Automotive and Ford Credit segments differently We monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program which includes regular reports to a central management committee the Global Risk Management Committee GRMC The GRMC is chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and the committee includes our Controller and Treasurer Our Automotive and Ford Credit segments are exposed to liquidity risk including the possibility of having to curtail business or being unable to meet financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable Our plan is to maintain funding sources to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles As discussed in greater detail in Item 7 our funding sources include sales of receivables in securitizations and other structured financings unsecured debt issuances equity and equitylinked issuances and bank borrowings We are exposed to a variety of risks such as loss or damage to property liability claims and employee injury We protect against these risks through the purchase of commercial insurance that is designed to protect us above our selfinsured retentions against events that could generate significant losses Direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our Treasurers Office and is governed by written policies and procedures Separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades the transaction of derivatives and the settlement of cash flows Regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective In addition our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are approved by the GRMC and reviewed by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors In accordance with our corporate risk management policies we use derivative instruments when available such as forward contracts swaps and options that economically hedge certain exposures foreign currency commodity and interest rates We do not use derivative contracts for trading marketmaking or speculative purposes In certain instances we forgo hedge accounting and in certain other instances our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting Either situation results in unrealized gains and losses that are recognized in income For additional information on our derivatives see Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements The market and counterparty risks of our Automotive and Ford Credit segments are discussed and quantified below AUTOMOTIVE MARKET RISK Our Automotive segment frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies including the following purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts debt and other payables subsidiary dividends and investments in foreign operations These expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates We also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in the production of our vehicles and changes in interest rates Foreign currency risk commodity risk and interest rate risk are measured and quantified using a model to evaluate the sensitivity of market value to instantaneous parallel shifts in rates andor prices Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in currency exchange rates Accordingly our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge our economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenues and costs assets liabilities and firm commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies consistent with our overall risk management strategy In our hedging actions we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk eg forward contracts 93 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Continued The net fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts including adjustments for credit risk as of December 31 2022 was an asset of 236 million compared with a liability of 253 million as of December 31 2021 The potential change in the fair value from a 10 change in the underlying exchange rates in US dollar terms would have been 19 billion at December 31 2022 compared with 22 billion at December 31 2021 The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes foreign exchange rate changes are instantaneous and adverse across all currencies In reality some of our exposures offset and foreign exchange rates move in different magnitudes and at different times and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure See Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contracts Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility that our financial results could be worse than planned because of changes in the prices of commodities used in the production of motor vehicles such as base metals eg steel copper and aluminum precious metals eg palladium energy eg natural gas and electricity and plasticsresins eg polypropylene As we transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles we expect to increase our reliance on lithium cobalt nickel graphite and manganese among other materials for batteries Accordingly our practice is to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we can economically hedge and consistent with our overall risk management strategy In our hedging actions we use derivative instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk eg financially settled forward contracts The extent to which we hedge is also impacted by our ability to achieve designated hedge accounting The net fair value of commodity forward contracts including adjustments for credit risk as of December 31 2022 was a liability of 49 million compared with an asset of 220 million as of December 31 2021 The potential change in the fair value from a 10 change in the underlying commodity prices would have been 178 million at December 31 2022 compared with 215 million at December 31 2021 The sensitivity analysis presented is hypothetical and assumes commodity price changes are instantaneous and adverse across all commodities In reality commodity prices move in different magnitudes and at different times and any changes in fair value would generally be offset by changes in the underlying exposure In addition our purchasing organization with guidance from the GRMC as appropriate negotiates contracts for the continuous supply of raw materials In some cases these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific prices and therefore play a role in managing commodity price risk Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk relates to the loss we could incur in our Company cash investment portfolios due to a change in interest rates Our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolios includes cash and cash equivalents and net marketable securities At December 31 2022 Company cash consisted of 02 billion of Rivian marketable securities and 321 billion of cash in our investment portfolios compared to 106 billion of Rivian marketable securities and 260 billion of cash in our investment portfolios at December 31 2021 We invest the portfolios in securities of various types and maturities the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates The investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity minimize risk and earn a reasonable return on the shortterm investments In investing the cash in our investment portfolios safety of principal is the primary objective and riskadjusted return is the secondary objective At any time a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolios Assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point the value of our portfolios would be reduced by 256 million as calculated as of December 31 2022 This compares to 250 million as calculated as of December 31 2021 While these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario actual results could differ from those projected The sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve In reality interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel 94 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Continued FORD CREDIT MARKET RISK Market risk for Ford Credit is the possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates will adversely affect cash flow and economic value Interest Rate Risk Generally Ford Credits assets and the related debt have different repricing periods and consequently respond differently to changes in interest rates Ford Credits assets consist primarily of fixedrate retail financing and operating lease contracts and floatingrate wholesale receivables Fixedrate retail financing and operating lease contracts generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract Wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicles held in dealers inventory and generally require dealers to pay a floating rate Debt consists primarily of short and longterm unsecured and securitized debt Ford Credits term debt instruments are principally fixedrate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity Ford Credits interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in its cash flows and volatility in its economic value from changes in interest rates based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market Ford Credit uses economic value sensitivity analysis and repricing gap analysis to evaluate potential longterm effects of changes in interest rates It then enters into interest rate swaps to convert portions of its floatingrate debt to fixed or its fixedrate debt to floating to ensure that Ford Credits exposure falls within the established tolerances Ford Credit also uses pretax cash flow sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of nearterm cash flow exposure The pretax cash flow sensitivity analysis measures the changes in expected cash flows associated with Ford Credits interestratesensitive assets liabilities and derivative financial instruments from hypothetical changes in interest rates over a twelvemonth horizon Interest rate swaps are placed to maintain exposure within approved thresholds and the AssetLiability Committee reviews the repricing mismatch monthly To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pretax cash flow to changes in interest rates Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rates across all maturities a parallel shift as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at existing levels In reality interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in Ford Credits analysis As a result the actual impact to pretax cash flow could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent Ford Credits view of future interest rate movements Under these interest rate scenarios Ford Credit expects more assets than debt and liabilities to reprice in the next twelve months Other things being equal this means that during a period of rising interest rates the interest received on Ford Credits assets will increase more than the interest paid on Ford Credits debt thereby initially increasing Ford Credits pretax cash flow During a period of falling interest rates Ford Credit would expect its pretax cash flow to initially decrease Ford Credits pretax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement at December 31 was as follows in millions PreTax Cash Flow Sensitivity 2021 2022 One percentage point instantaneous increase in interest rates 76 127 One percentage point instantaneous decrease in interest rates a 76 127 __________ a Pretax cash flow sensitivity given a one percentage point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in markets where existing interest rates are below one percent While the sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credits best estimate of the impacts of the specified assumed interest rate scenarios its actual results could differ from those projected The model Ford Credit uses to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions Embedded in the model are assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivatives exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives and predicted repayment of retail financing and operating lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity Ford Credits repayment projections ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience If interest rates or other factors change Ford Credits actual prepayment experience could be different than projected 95 Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Continued Foreign Currency Risk Ford Credits policy is to minimize exposure to changes in currency exchange rates To meet funding objectives Ford Credit borrows in a variety of currencies principally US dollars Canadian dollars euros sterling and renminbi Ford Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables When possible receivables are funded with debt in the same currency minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements When a different currency is used Ford Credit may use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables As a result of this policy Ford Credit believes its market risk exposure relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31 2022 is insignificant Derivative Fair Values The net fair value of Ford Credits derivative financial instruments at December 31 2022 was a liability of 20 billion compared to an asset of 553 million at December 31 2021 The decline in net fair value was driven by higher US interest rates and a stronger US dollar COUNTERPARTY RISK Counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract We enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to manage this risk Exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risk We together with Ford Credit establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification Our approach to managing counterparty risk is forwardlooking and proactive allowing us to take risk mitigation actions before risks become losses Exposure limits are established based on our overall risk tolerance which is calculated from counterparty credit ratings and marketbased credit default swap CDS spreads The exposure limits are lower for smaller and lowerrated counterparties counterparties that have relatively higher CDS spreads and for longer dated exposures Our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and included in periodic reports to our Treasurer Substantially all of our counterparty exposures are with counterparties that have an investment grade rating Investment grade is our guideline for minimum counterparty longterm ratings ITEM

Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a15f or 15d15f The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate Under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our CEO and CFO we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2022 The assessment was based on criteria established in the framework Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of

including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15a2 collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO In our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Company as of December 31 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America Also in our opinion the Company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the COSO Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses in 2020 Basis for Opinions The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks Such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions 106 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that i relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and ii involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matters below providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate Ford Credit Consumer Finance Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements the Company had consumer finance receivables of 71414 million for which a consumer allowance for credit losses of 838 million was recorded as of December 31 2022 The consumer allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the consumer finance receivables as of the balance sheet date For consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics management estimates the lifetime expected credit losses based on a collective assessment using measurement models and management judgment The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumptions to monthly expected exposures then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivables original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable If management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty observable changes in portfolio performance and other relevant factors The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Ford Credit consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are i the significant judgment by management in determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses ii a high degree of auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the probability of default and loss given default assumptions and managements judgment regarding qualitative factors and iii the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Companys determination of the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses These procedures also included among others i testing managements process for determining the consumer finance receivables allowance for credit losses ii evaluating the appropriateness of the models used to determine the allowance iii evaluating the reasonableness of the probability of default and loss given default assumptions iv testing the data used in the models and v evaluating the reasonableness of managements judgment regarding qualitative factors related to economic uncertainty observable changes in portfolio performance and other relevant factors

time of sale Management establishes their estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model using historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year Management establishes their estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model using historical information regarding the nature frequency severity and average cost of claims for each model year Management reevaluates the adequacy of their accruals on a regular basis The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the warranty accrual for the United States is a critical audit matter are i the significant judgment by management in the estimation of the accrual and development of the patterned estimation model ii a high degree of auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the estimation model and significant assumptions related to the frequency and average cost of claims and iii the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to the estimate of the warranty accrual for the United States These procedures also included among others evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management to develop the warranty accrual for the United States related to the frequency and average cost of claims in part by considering the historical experience of the Company Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES For each accounting topic that is addressed in its own note the description of the accounting policy may be found in the related note Other significant accounting policies are described below Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our results Estimates are used to account for certain items such as marketing accruals warranty costs employee benefit programs allowance for credit losses and other items requiring judgment Estimates are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances Due to the inherent uncertainty involved with estimates actual results may differ Foreign Currency When an entity has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from its functional currency we remeasure those assets and liabilities from the transactional currency to the entitys functional currency The effect of this remeasurement process and the results of our related foreign currency hedging activities are reported in Cost of sales and Other incomeloss net and were 46 million 74 million and 180 million for the years ended 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively Generally our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to US dollars using endofperiod exchange rates Changes in the carrying value of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates are recognized in Foreign currency translation a component of Other comprehensive incomeIoss net of tax Upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary the amount of accumulated foreign currency translation related to the entity is reclassified to income and recognized as part of the gain or loss on the investment Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate quoted price or penalty on withdrawal A debt security is classified as a cash equivalent if it meets these criteria and if it has a remaining time to maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase Amounts on deposit and available upon demand or negotiated to provide for daily liquidity without penalty are classified as Cash and cash equivalents Time deposits certificates of deposit and money market accounts that meet the above criteria are reported at par value on our consolidated balance sheets Restricted Cash Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements are recorded in Other assets in the noncurrent assets section of our consolidated balance sheets Our Company excluding Ford Credit restricted cash balances primarily include various escrow agreements related to legal insurance customs and environmental matters and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements Our Ford Credit segment restricted cash balances primarily include cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements Restricted cash does not include required minimum balances or cash securing debt issued through securitization transactions 115 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued Marketable Securities Investments in debt securities with a maturity date greater than three months at the date of purchase and other debt securities for which there is more than an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate quoted price or penalty on withdrawal are classified and accounted for as either trading or availableforsale marketable securities Equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are classified and accounted for as trading marketable securities Realized gains and losses interest income and dividend income on all of our marketable securities and unrealized gains and losses on securities not classified as available for sale are recorded in Other incomeloss net Unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities are recognized in Unrealized gains and losses on securities a component of Other comprehensive incomeloss net of tax Realized gains and losses and reclassifications of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income are measured using the specific identification method On a quarterly basis we review our availableforsale debt securities for credit losses We compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security we determine if a credit loss allowance is necessary If a credit loss allowance is necessary we will record an allowance limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis and recognize the corresponding charge in Other incomeloss net Factors we consider include the severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value interest rate changes and counterparty longterm ratings Trade Notes and Other Receivables Trade notes and other receivables consist primarily of receivables from contracts with customers for the sale of vehicles parts and accessories The current portion of trade and notes receivables is reported in Trade and other receivables net The noncurrent portion of notes receivables is reported in Other assets Trade and notes receivables are initially recorded at transaction cost Trade receivables are typically outstanding for 30 days or less Each reporting period we evaluate the collectibility of the trade and notes receivables and record an allowance for credit losses representing our estimate of the expected losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the receivables Additions to the allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges to bad debt expense reported in Selling administrative and other expenses and Cost of sales Trade and notes receivables are written off against the allowance for credit losses when the account is deemed to be uncollectible Net Intangible Assets and Goodwill Indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired Goodwill impairment testing is also performed following an allocation of goodwill to a business to be disposed or a change in reporting units We test for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset or the reporting unit allocated the goodwill is less than its carrying amount If the qualitative assessment indicates a possible impairment the carrying value of the asset or reporting unit is compared with its fair value Fair value is measured relying primarily on the income approach by applying a discounted cash flow method the market approach using market values or multiples andor thirdparty valuations We capitalize and amortize our finitelived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives The carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill is reported in Other assets in the noncurrent assets section of our consolidated balance sheets Intangible assets are comprised primarily of advertising agreements land rights and technology licenses The net carrying amount of our intangible assets was 111 million and 86 million at December 31 2021 and 2022 respectively For the periods presented we have not recorded any material impairments for indefinitelived intangibles The net carrying amount of goodwill was 619 million and 603 million at December 31 2021 and 2022 respectively In 2021 we fully impaired goodwill for two investments in our Mobility segment In 2022 we have not recorded any impairments for goodwill 116 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued HeldandUsed LongLived Asset Impairment We test longlived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses significant negative industry or economic trends a current expectation that a longlived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition or when there is a change in the asset grouping In addition investing in new emerging products eg EVs or services eg connectivity may require substantial upfront investment which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term In these instances near term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment In such circumstances we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated confirming whether established milestones are being achieved and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred a test for recoverability is performed When a triggering event occurs a test for recoverability is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets the asset groups fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method To the extent available we will also consider thirdparty valuations of our longlived assets that were prepared for other business purposes An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life For the periods presented we have not recorded any material impairments HeldforSale Asset Impairment We perform an impairment test on a disposal group to be discontinued held for sale HFS or otherwise disposed when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be completed within one year We estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received less cost to sell and compare it to the carrying value of the disposal group An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value see Note 22 We also assess fair value if circumstances arise that were considered unlikely and as a result we decide not to sell a disposal group previously classified as HFS upon reclassification as held and used When there is a change to a plan of sale and the assets are reclassified from HFS to held and used the longlived assets would be reported at the lower of i the carrying amount before HFS designation adjusted for depreciation that would have been recognized if the assets had not been classified as HFS or ii the fair value at the date the assets no longer satisfy the criteria for classification as HFS Fair Value Measurements We measure fair value of our financial instruments including those held within our pension plans using various valuation methods and prioritize the use of observable inputs The use of observable and unobservable inputs and their significance in measuring fair value are reflected in our fair value hierarchy Level 1 inputs include quoted prices for identical instruments and are the most observable Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments and observable inputs such as interest rates currency exchange rates and yield curves Level 3 inputs include data not observable in the market and reflect management judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the instruments Fixed income securities equities commingled funds derivative financial instruments and alternative assets are remeasured and presented within our consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis Finance receivables and debt are measured at fair value for the purpose of disclosure Other assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis Transfers into and transfers out of the hierarchy levels are recognized as if they had taken place at the end of the reporting period 117 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued Valuation Method Fixed Income Securities Fixed income securities primarily include government securities government agency securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities We generally measure fair value using prices obtained from pricing services or quotes from dealers that make markets in such securities Pricing methods and inputs to valuation models used by the pricing services depend on the security type ie asset class Where possible fair values are generated using market inputs including quoted prices the closing price in an exchange market bid prices the price at which a buyer stands ready to purchase and other market information For fixed income securities that are not actively traded the pricing services use alternative methods to determine fair value for the securities including quotes for similar fixed income securities matrix pricing discounted cash flow using benchmark curves or other factors In certain cases when market data are not available we may use broker quotes or pricing services that use proprietary pricing models to determine fair value The proprietary models incorporate unobservable inputs primarily consisting of prepayment curves discount rates default assumptions recovery rates yield assumptions and credit spread assumptions An annual review is performed on the security prices received from our pricing services which includes discussion and analysis of the inputs used by the pricing services to value our securities We also compare the price of certain securities sold close to the quarter end to the price of the same security at the balance sheet date to ensure the reported fair value is reasonable Equities Equity securities are primarily exchangetraded and are valued based on the closing bid official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange If closing prices are not available securities are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price Securities that are thinly traded or delisted are valued using unobservable pricing data Commingled Funds Fixed income and public equity securities may each be combined into commingled fund investments Most commingled funds are valued to reflect our interest in the fund based on the reported yearend net asset value NAV Derivative Financial Instruments Exchangetraded derivatives for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded Overthecounter derivatives are not exchange traded and are valued using independent pricing services or industrystandard valuation models such as a discounted cash flow When discounted cash flow models are used projected future cash flows are discounted to a present value using marketbased expectations for interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and the contractual terms of the derivative instruments The discount rate used is the relevant benchmark interest rate eg LIBOR SOFR SONIA plus an adjustment for nonperformance risk The adjustment reflects the full credit default swap CDS spread applied to a net exposure by counterparty considering the master netting agreements and any posted collateral We use our counterpartys CDS spread when we are in a net asset position and our own CDS spread when we are in a net liability position In cases when market data are not available we use broker quotes and models eg BlackScholes to determine fair value This includes situations where there is a lack of liquidity for a particular currency or commodity or when the instrument is longer dated When broker quotes or models are used to determine fair value the derivative is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy All other derivatives are categorized within Level 2 Alternative Assets Hedge funds generally hold liquid and readilypriced securities such as public equities exchangetraded derivatives and corporate bonds Private equity and real estate investments are less liquid External investment managers typically report valuations reflecting initial cost or updated appraisals which are adjusted for cash flows and realized and unrealized gainslosses All alternative assets are valued at the NAV provided by the investment sponsor or third party administrator as they do not have readilyavailable market quotations Valuations may be lagged up to six months The NAV will be adjusted for cash flows additional investments or contributions and distributions through year end We may make further adjustments for any known substantive valuation changes not reflected in the NAV 118 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued We may hold annuity contracts within some of our nonUS pension plans see Note 17 Generally the contract valuation method is applied for markets where we have purchased nonparticipating annuity contracts from an insurer as a plan asset The FordWerke GmbH FordWerke defined benefit plan is primarily funded through a participating group insurance contract For the FordWerke plan we measure the fair value of the insurance asset by projecting expected future cash flows from the contract and discounting them to present value based on current market rates as well as an assessment for nonperformance risk of the insurance company The assumptions used to project expected future cash flows are based on actuarial estimates and are unobservable We include all annuity contracts within Level 3 of the hierarchy Finance Receivables We measure finance receivables at fair value using internal valuation models see Note 10 These models project future cash flows of financing contracts based on scheduled contract payments including principal and interest and assumptions regarding expected credit losses and prepayment speed The projected cash flows are discounted to present value at current rates that incorporate present yield curve and credit spread assumptions The fair value of finance receivables is categorized within Level 3 of the hierarchy On a nonrecurring basis we also measure at fair value retail contracts greater than 120 days past due or deemed to be uncollectible and individual dealer loans probable of foreclosure We use the fair value of collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell to determine the fair value of these receivables The collateral for a retail financing or wholesale receivable is the vehicle financed and for dealer loans is real estate or other property The fair value of collateral for retail receivables is calculated as the outstanding receivable balances multiplied by the average recovery value percentage The fair value of collateral for wholesale receivables is based on the wholesale market value or liquidation value for new and used vehicles The fair value of collateral for dealer loans is determined by reviewing various appraisals which include total adjusted appraised value of land and improvements alternate use appraised value brokers opinion of value and purchase offers Debt We measure debt at fair value using quoted prices for our own debt with approximately the same remaining maturities see Note 19 Where quoted prices are not available we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows and marketbased expectations for interest rates credit risk and the contractual terms of the debt instruments For certain shortterm debt with an original maturity date of one year or less we assume that book value is a reasonable approximation of the debts fair value The fair value of debt is categorized within Level 2 of the hierarchy Finance and Lease Incentives We routinely sponsor special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration when the vehicle is sold to the dealer Ford Credit records a reduction to the finance receivable or reduces the cost of the vehicle operating lease when it records the underlying finance contract and we transfer to Ford Credit the amount of the incentive on behalf of the dealers customer See Note 1 for additional information regarding transactions between Automotive and Ford Credit The Ford Credit segment recognized interest revenue of 24 billion 24 billion and 21 billion in 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively and lower depreciation of 23 billion 19 billion and 12 billion in 2020 2021 and 2022 respectively associated with these incentives Supplier Price Adjustments We frequently negotiate price adjustments with our suppliers throughout a production cycle even after receiving production material These price adjustments relate to changes in design specification or other commercial terms such as economics productivity and competitive pricing We recognize price adjustments when we reach final agreement with our suppliers In general we avoid direct price changes in consideration of future business however when these occur our policy is to defer the recognition of any such price change given explicitly in consideration of future business 119 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued Government Incentives We receive incentives from US and nonUS governmental entities in the form of tax rebates or credits grants and loans Government incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense or other income The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met and there is reasonable assurance of receipt Government incentives related to capital investment are recognized in Net Property as a reduction to the net book value of the related asset The incentives are recognized over the life of the asset as a reduction to depreciation and amortization expense During 2022 we were awarded incentives by the State of Tennessee related to land capital and property tax abatements in connection with Fords capital investment in our new electric vehicle assembly plant and job commitments These incentives are available until December 2051 The fair value of the land benefit in 2022 was 144 million and was recorded in Net Property fully offset by the value of the incentive A capital grant of 285 million is expected to be received in 2023 and will reduce the depreciation and amortization expense over the life of the related assets In 2022 we were also awarded incentives by the Canadian government and Province of Ontario in connection with the development of electric vehicles at our Oakville Assembly Plant Equipment tooling and labor incentives of C 590 million are expected to be received over the terms of the agreements beginning in 2024 through 2033 and will be recognized as a reduction of the related expenses Ford may also indirectly benefit from incentives and grants awarded to companies with which we are affiliated but are not included in our consolidated financial statements Fords receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction termination or claw

in exchange for transferring goods or providing services For the majority of sales this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities However we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or standready performance obligation such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity Sales valueadded and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenueproducing activities are excluded from revenue Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense The expected costs

received at or shortly after the point of sale 122 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 4 REVENUE Continued Company Excluding Ford Credit Vehicles Parts and Accessories For the majority of vehicles parts and accessories we transfer control and recognize a sale when we ship the product from our manufacturing facility to our customer dealers and distributors We receive cash equal to the invoice price for most vehicle sales at the time of wholesale When the vehicle sale is financed by our whollyowned subsidiary Ford Credit the dealer is obligated to pay Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to the retail customer see Note 10 Payment terms on part sales to dealers distributors and retailers range from 30 to 120 days The amount of consideration we receive and revenue we recognize varies with changes in return rights and marketing incentives we offer to our customers and their customers When we give our dealers the right to return eligible parts and accessories we estimate the expected returns based on an analysis of historical experience Estimates of marketing incentives are based on expected retail and fleet sales volumes mix of products to be sold and incentive programs to be offered Customer acceptance of products and programs as well as other market conditions will impact these estimates We adjust our estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the value of consideration we expect to receive changes or when the consideration becomes fixed As a result of changes in our estimate of marketing incentives we recorded a decrease in revenue of 973 million during 2020 and an increase in revenue of 252 million and 209 million during 2021 and 2022 respectively related to revenue recognized in prior annual periods We have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in Cost of sales We sell vehicles to daily rental companies and may guarantee that we will pay them the difference between an agreed amount and the value they are able to realize upon resale At the time of transfer of vehicles to the daily rental companies we record the probable amount we will pay under the guarantee to Other liabilities and deferred revenue see Note 25 Used Vehicles We sell used vehicles both at auction and through our consolidated dealerships Proceeds from the sale of these vehicles are recognized in Company excluding Ford Credit revenues upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the

consideration received eg free extended service contracts vehicle connectivity overtheair updates we use an observable price to determine the standalone selling price or when one is not available we use a costplus margin approach We also sell separately priced service contracts that extend mechanical and maintenance coverages beyond our base warranty agreements to vehicle owners We receive payment at contract inception and the contracts generally range from 12 to 120 months We recognize revenue for vehicle service contracts that extend mechanical and maintenance coverages beyond our base warranties over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations Revenue related to other future or standready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed We had a balance of 42 billion and 43 billion of unearned revenue associated primarily with outstanding extended service contracts reported in Other liabilities and deferred revenue at December 31 2020 and 2021 respectively We recognized 13 billion and 14 billion of the unearned amounts as revenue during the years ended December 31 2021 and 2022 respectively At December 31 2022 the unearned amount was 44 billion We expect to recognize approximately 13 billion of the unearned amount in 2023 11 billion in 2024 and 2 billion thereafter We record a premium deficiency reserve to the extent we estimate the future costs associated with extended service contracts exceed the unrecognized revenue Amounts paid to dealers to obtain these contracts are deferred and recorded as Other assets These costs are amortized to expense consistent with how the related revenue is recognized We had a balance of 309 million and 315 million in deferred costs as of December 31 2021 and 2022 respectively We recognized 79 million 81 million and 88 million of amortization during the

proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice Leasing Income We sell vehicles to daily rental companies with an obligation to repurchase the vehicles for a guaranteed amount exercisable at the option of the customer The transactions are accounted for as operating leases Upon the transfer of vehicles to the daily rental companies we record proceeds received in Other liabilities and deferred revenue The difference between the proceeds received and the guaranteed repurchase amount is recorded in Company excluding Ford Credit revenues over the term of the lease using a straightline method The cost of the vehicle is recorded in Net investment in operating leases on our consolidated balance sheets and the difference between the cost of the vehicle and the estimated auction value is depreciated in Cost of sales over the term of the lease Ford Credit Segment Leasing Income Ford Credit offers leasing plans to retail consumers through Ford and Lincoln brand dealers that originate the leases Ford Credit records an operating lease upon purchase of a vehicle subject to a lease from the dealer The retail consumer makes lease payments representing the difference between Ford

corresponding reduction in shares available for grants in future years Granted RSUs generally cliff vest or ratably vest over a threeyear service period Performancebased RSUs have two components one based on internal financial performance metrics and the other based on total shareholder return relative to an industrial and automotive peer group At the time of vest RSU awards are net settled ie shares are withheld to cover the employee tax obligation Stock options ratably vest over a threeyear service period and expire ten years from the grant date The fair value of both the timebased and the internal performance metrics portion of the performancebased RSUs and RSSs is determined using the closing price of our Common Stock at grant date For awards that include a market condition we measure the fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation The weighted average per unit grant date fair value for the years ended December 31 2020 2021 and 2022 was 711 1302 and 1563 respectively Timebased RSUs generally have a graded vesting feature whereby onethird of each grant vests after the first anniversary of the grant date onethird after the second anniversary and onethird after the third anniversary The graded vesting method recognizes expense over the service period for each separatelyvesting tranche which results in accelerated recognition of expense The fair value of timebased RSUs RSSs and stock options is expensed over the shorter of each separate vesting period using the graded vesting method or the time period an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement The fair value of performancebased RSUs and RSSs is expensed when it is probable and estimable as measured against the performance metrics over the shorter of the performance or required service periods We measure the fair value of our stock options on the date of grant using either the BlackScholes optionpricing model for options without a market condition or a Monte Carlo simulation for options with a market condition We have elected to recognize forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense for all RSUs RSSs and stock options in the same period as the forfeitures occur

assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid 126 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 7 INCOME TAXES Continued Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns and their future probability In assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the

of 29 billion to recognize deferred tax assets resulting from changes in our global tax structure in 2021 During 2020 based on all available evidence we established US valuation allowances of 13 billion primarily against tax credits as it was deemed more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would not be realized In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider the tradeoffs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits In 2021 we reversed 918 million of the previously established US valuation allowances The reversal primarily reflected a change in our intent to pursue planning actions involving cash outlays to preserve tax credits During 2022 we reversed an additional 405 million of US valuation allowances primarily as a result of planning actions At December 31 2022 148 billion of nonUS earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided

ability to hold the receivables for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff The determination of intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future is highly judgmental and requires Ford Credit to make good faith estimates based on all information available at the time of origination or purchase If Ford Credit does not have the intent and ability to hold the receivables then the receivables are classified as HFS Each quarter Ford Credit makes a determination of whether it is probable that finance receivables originated or purchased during the quarter will be held for the foreseeable future based on historical receivables sale experience internal forecasts and budgets as well as other relevant reliable information available through the date of evaluation For purposes of this determination probable means at least 70 likely and consistent with the budgeting and forecasting period the foreseeable future means twelve months Ford Credit classifies receivables as HFI or

information The evaluation emphasizes the applicants ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment affordability applicant credit history and stability as key considerations After origination Ford Credit reviews the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity As each customer develops a payment history an internally developed behavioral scoring model is used to assist in determining the best collection strategies which allows Ford Credit to focus collection activity on higherrisk accounts These models are used to refine Ford Credits riskbased staffing model to ensure collection resources are aligned with portfolio risk Based on data from this scoring model contracts are categorized by collection risk Ford Credits collection models evaluate

Ford and Lincoln vehicles as well as used vehicles Payment is required when the dealer has sold the vehicle Each nonconsumer lending request is evaluated by considering the borrowers financial condition and the underlying collateral securing the loan Ford Credit uses a proprietary model to assign each dealer a risk rating This model uses historical dealer performance data to identify key factors about a dealer that are considered most significant in predicting a dealers ability to meet its financial obligations Ford Credit also considers numerous other financial and qualitative factors of the dealers operations including capitalization and leverage liquidity and cash flow profitability and credit history with Ford Credit and other creditors Dealers are assigned to one of four groups according to risk ratings as follows Group I strong to superior financial metrics Group II fair to favorable financial metrics Group III marginal to weak financial metrics and Group IV poor financial metrics including dealers classified as uncollectible Ford Credit generally suspends credit lines and extends no further funding to dealers classified in Group IV 137 FORD MOTOR COMPANY

business significance and statistical predictability of the model and may make updates to improve the performance of the model In addition Ford Credit regularly audits dealer inventory and dealer sales records to verify that the dealer is in possession of the financed vehicles and is promptly paying each receivable following the sale of the financed vehicle The frequency of onsite vehicle inventory audits depends primarily on the dealers risk rating Under Ford Credits policies onsite vehicle inventory audits of lowrisk dealers are conducted only as circumstances warrant Onsite vehicle inventory audits of higherrisk dealers are conducted with increased frequency based primarily on the dealers risk rating but also considering the results of electronic monitoring of the dealers performance including daily payment verifications and monthly analyses of the dealers financial statements payoffs aged inventory over credit line and delinquency reports Ford Credit typically performs a credit review of each dealer annually and more frequently reviews certain dealers based on the dealers risk rating and total exposure Ford Credit adjusts the dealers risk rating if

allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges to Ford Credit interest operating and other expenses on our consolidated income statements The uncollectible portion of a finance receivable is charged to the allowance for credit losses at the earlier of when an account is deemed to be uncollectible or when an account is 120 days delinquent taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer or borrower the value of the collateral recourse to guarantors and other factors Chargeoffs on finance receivables include uncollected amounts related to principal interest late fees and other allowable charges Recoveries on finance receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance for credit losses In the event Ford Credit repossesses the collateral the receivable is charged off and the collateral is recorded at its estimated fair value less costs to sell and reported in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets Consumer Portfolio For consumer receivables that share similar risk characteristics such as product type initial credit risk term vintage geography and other relevant factors Ford Credit estimates the lifetime expected credit loss allowance based on a collective assessment using measurement models and management judgment The lifetime expected credit losses for the receivables is determined by applying probability of default and loss given default assumption to monthly expected exposures then discounting these cash flows to present value using the receivables original effective interest rate or the current effective interest rate for a variable rate receivable Probability of default models are developed from internal risk scoring models taking into account the expected probability of payment and time to default adjusted for macroeconomic outlook and recent performance The models consider factors such as risk evaluation at the time of origination historical trends in credit losses which include the impact of TDRs and the composition and recent performance of the present portfolio including vehicle brand term risk evaluation and newused vehicles The loss given default is the percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable taking into account the expected collateral value and trends in recoveries including key metrics such as delinquencies repossessions and bankruptcies Monthly exposures are equal to the receivables expected outstanding principal and interest balance The allowance for credit losses incorporates forwardlooking macroeconomic conditions for baseline upturn and downturn scenarios Three separate credit loss allowances are calculated from these scenarios They are then probabilityweighted to determine the quantitative estimate of the credit loss allowance recognized in the financial statements Ford Credit uses forecasts from a third party that revert to a longterm historical average after a reasonable and supportable forecasting period which is specific to the particular macroeconomic variable and which varies by market Ford Credit updates the forwardlooking macroeconomic forecasts quarterly If management does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty observable changes in portfolio performance and other relevant factors On an ongoing basis Ford Credit reviews its models including macroeconomic factors the selection of macroeconomic scenarios and their weighting to ensure they reflect the risk of the portfolio 139 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 10 FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES Continued NonConsumer Portfolio Dealer financing is evaluated on an individual dealer basis by segmenting dealers by risk characteristics such as the amount of the loans the nature of the collateral the financial status of the dealer and any TDR modifications to determine if an individual dealer requires a specific allowance for credit loss If required the allowance is based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the dealers receivables discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell For the remaining dealer financing Ford Credit estimates an allowance for credit losses on a collective basis Wholesale Loans Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans based on historical losstoreceivable LTR ratios expected future cash flows and the fair value of collateral For wholesale loans with similar risk characteristics the allowance for credit losses is estimated on a collective basis using the LTR model and management judgment The LTR model is based on the most recent years of history An LTR ratio is calculated by dividing credit losses ie chargeoffs net of recoveries by average net finance receivables excluding unearned interest supplements and allowance for credit losses The average LTR ratio is multiplied by the endofperiod balances representing the lifetime expected credit loss reserve Dealer Loans Ford Credit uses a weightedaverage remaining maturity method to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss reserve for dealer loans The loss model is based on the industrywide commercial real estate credit losses adjusted to factor in the historical credit losses for the dealer loans portfolio The expected credit loss is calculated under different macroeconomic scenarios that are weighted to provide the total lifetime expected credit loss After establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit losses if management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions or other relevant forwardlooking economic factors an adjustment is made based on management judgment 140 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 10

intelligence company that became a consolidated subsidiary with a commitment to fund 1 billion over five years to develop autonomous vehicle technology In 2020 we completed a transaction with Volkswagen AG VW that resulted in Ford and VW holding equal interests in Argo AI which together comprised a majority ownership of the entity As a result of this transaction which included 500 million of proceeds from the sale to VW of a portion of our interest in Argo AI we deconsolidated Argo AI remeasured our retained investment in the entity at fair value and net of our carrying value in Argo AIs net assets recognized a 35 billion pretax gain in Other incomeloss net Immediately following this transaction our retained investment consisted of a 24 billion equity method investment and a 400 million preferred equity security investment which were reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in Equity in net assets of affiliated companies and Other assets respectively Although Argo AI made progress on developing highly automated driving technology L4 to achieve commercially viable scale Argo AIs technology requires significant additional capital investment and time In the near term we see more potential for partial or conditional automated driving technology L2L3 to be transformative for customers and our business Therefore in the third quarter of 2022 we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from L4 technology being developed by Argo AI to advanced L2L3 systems which we believe will ultimately be essential to achieve profitable commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale in the future Additionally because of the significant additional capital and time required to achieve commercialization of L4 as well as other macroeconomic factors Argo AI has been unable to attract new investors After performing external outreach in the third quarter of 2022 to assess market interest in acquiring either Argo AI or its technology components and conducting internal reviews to evaluate opportunities to leverage Argo AIs technology Ford determined that Argo AI no longer has value as a going concern As a result we reassessed the carrying value of our investment in Argo AI starting from September 30 2022 and in October 2022 Ford and VW initiated the process of exiting the joint development of L4 technology through Argo AI On October 26 2022 we announced that Argo AI plans to wind down operations which is in progress Our valuation assumed an orderly conclusion of operations at Argo AI in which the cash required to satisfy the remaining obligations would consume all of Argo AIs remaining capital In addition we assessed whether Argo AIs technology components have value in isolation and we concluded that the cost to integrate into currently anticipated technology ecosystems would be prohibitive Accordingly we recorded a 27 billion pretax impairment in the second half of 2022 The noncash charge was reported in Equity in net incomeloss of affiliated companies The carrying value of our investment in Argo AI is 0 as of December 31 2022 in addition we have 65 million in Other liabilities and deferred revenue related to our funding commitment in 2023 for our share of Argo AIs expenses incurred in 2022 The carrying value immediately prior to the impairment was higher than our net cash investment of approximately 500 million ie our 1 billion investment less proceeds we received from VW due to the noncash gain recognized when we deconsolidated Argo AI in 2020 as described above 145 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND

146 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 17 RETIREMENT BENEFITS Defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations are remeasured at least annually as of December 31 based on the present value of projected future benefit payments for all participants for services rendered to date The measurement of projected future benefits is dependent on the provisions of each specific plan demographics of the group covered by the plan and other key measurement assumptions For plans that provide benefits dependent on salary assumptions we include a projection of salary growth in our measurements No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed eg in existing labor contracts Net periodic benefit costs including service cost interest cost and expected return on assets are determined using assumptions regarding the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets where applicable as of the beginning of each year We have elected to use a fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets in net periodic benefit cost The funded status of the benefit plans which represents the difference between the benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets is calculated on a planbyplan basis The benefit obligation and related funded status are determined using assumptions as of the end of each year Actuarial gains and losses resulting from plan remeasurement are recognized in net periodic benefit cost in the period of the remeasurement The impact of a retroactive plan amendment is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss and is amortized as a component of net periodic cost generally over the remaining service period of the active employees The service cost component is included in Cost of sales and Selling administrative and other expenses Other components of net periodic benefit costincome are included in Other incomeloss net on our consolidated income statements A curtailment results from an event that significantly reduces the expected years of future service or eliminates the accrual of defined benefits for the future services of a significant number of employees A curtailment gain is recorded when the employees who are entitled to a benefit terminate their employment or when a plan suspension or amendment that results in a curtailment gain is adopted A curtailment loss is recorded when it becomes probable a curtailment loss will occur We recognize settlement expense when the costs associated with all settlements during the year exceed the interest component of net periodic cost for the affected plan Expense from curtailments and settlements is recorded in Other incomeloss net Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering hourly and salaried employees in the United States Canada United Kingdom Germany and other locations The largest portion of our worldwide obligation is associated with our US plans Virtually all of our worldwide defined benefit plans are closed to new participants In general our defined benefit pension plans are funded ie have

primarily include certain plans in Germany and the US defined benefit plans for senior management OPEB We have defined benefit OPEB plans primarily certain health care and life insurance benefits covering hourly and salaried employees in the United States Canada and other locations The largest portion of our worldwide obligation is associated with our US plans Our OPEB plans are unfunded and the benefits are paid from general Company cash Defined Contribution and Savings Plans We also have defined contribution and savings plans for hourly and salaried employees in the United States and

minimize the volatility of the value of our US pension assets relative to US pension obligations and to ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits Our largest nonUS plans eg United Kingdom and Canada have similar investment objectives to the US plans Investment strategies and policies for the US plans and the largest nonUS plans reflect a balance of riskreducing and returnseeking considerations The objective of minimizing the volatility of assets relative to obligations is addressed primarily through assetliability matching asset diversification and hedging The fixed income asset allocation matches the bondlike and longdated nature of the pension obligations Assets are broadly diversified within asset classes to achieve riskadjusted returns that in total lower asset volatility relative to the obligations Strategies to address the goal of ensuring sufficient assets to pay benefits include target allocations to a broad array of asset classes and strategies within asset classes that provide adequate returns diversification and liquidity 150 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 17 RETIREMENT BENEFITS Continued Derivatives are permitted for fixed income investment and public equity managers to use as efficient substitutes for traditional securities and to manage exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks Interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments are used for the purpose of hedging changes in the fair value of assets that result from interest rate changes and currency fluctuations Interest rate derivatives are also used to adjust portfolio duration Derivatives may not be used to leverage or to alter the economic exposure to an asset class outside the scope of the mandate an investment manager has been given Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage including through the use of derivatives or other tools that may alter economic exposure Alternative investments execute diverse strategies that provide exposure to a broad range of hedge fund strategies equity investments in private companies and investments in private property funds Significant Concentrations of Risk Significant concentrations of risk in our plan assets relate to interest rates growth assets and operating risks In order to minimize asset volatility relative to the obligations the majority of plan assets are allocated to fixed income investments which are exposed to interest rate risk Rate increases generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets while reducing the present value of the obligations Conversely rate decreases generally will increase the value of fixed income assets offsetting the related increase in the obligations In order to ensure assets are sufficient to pay benefits a portion of plan assets is allocated to growth assets primarily hedge funds real estate private equity and public equity that are expected over time to earn higher returns with more volatility than fixed income investments which more closely match pension obligations Within growth assets risk is mitigated by constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by asset class investment strategy manager style and process Operating risks include the risks of inadequate diversification and weak controls To mitigate these risks investments are diversified across and within asset classes in support of investment objectives Policies and practices to address operating risks include ongoing manager oversight eg style adherence team strength firm health and internal risk controls plan and asset class investment guidelines and instructions that are communicated to managers and periodic compliance reviews to ensure adherence At yearend 2022 Ford securities comprised less than 1 of our plan assets Expected LongTerm Rate of Return on Assets The longterm return assumption at yearend 2022 which will be used to determine the 2023 expected return on assets is 625 for the US plans 375 for the UK plans and 503 for the Canadian plans and averages 413 for all nonUS plans A generally consistent approach is used worldwide to develop this assumption This approach considers primarily inputs from a range of advisors for longterm capital market returns inflation bond yields and other variables adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan Historical returns also are considered where appropriate The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs with a focus on longterm trends to avoid shortterm market influences 151 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 17 RETIREMENT BENEFITS Continued The fair value of our defined benefit pension plan assets including dividends

land dealership facilities offices distribution centers warehouses and equipment under agreements with contractual periods ranging from less than one year to 40 years Many of our leases contain one or

lease We include options that we are reasonably certain to exercise in our evaluation of the lease term after considering all relevant economic and financial factors Leases that are economically similar to the purchase of an asset are classified as finance leases The leased rightofuse assets in finance lease arrangements are reported in Net property on our consolidated balance sheets Otherwise the leases are classified as operating leases and reported in Other assets in the noncurrent assets section of our consolidated balance sheets We have also entered into manufacturing contracts commencing in a future period where Fords portion of the output is expected to be significant As a result there may be embedded leases and related liabilities that will be reported as part of our financial statements typically upon commencement of production For the majority of our leases we do not separate the nonlease components eg maintenance and operating services from the lease components to which they relate Instead nonlease components are included in the measurement of the lease liabilities However we do separate lease and nonlease components for contracts containing a significant service component eg energy performance contracts We calculate the initial lease liability as the present value of fixed payments not yet paid and variable payments that are based on a market rate or an index eg CPI measured at commencement The majority of our leases are discounted using our incremental borrowing rate because the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable All other variable payments are expensed as incurred 154 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 18 LEASE COMMITMENTS Continued Lease rightofuse assets

The Ford Romania plant in Craiova Romania will continue to manufacture Fordbranded vehicles for Ford and Ford Otosan Fords portion of the output is expected to be significant as a result at the time of sale there were about 100 million of assets such as embedded leases and related liabilities that continue to be reported as part of our financial statements Sanand India Sanand Plants In the third quarter of 2022 we entered into an agreement to sell our Sanand vehicle assembly and powertrain plants to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited Tata a subsidiary of Tata Motors Limited The sale transaction includes the land buildings and other fixed assets excluding the powertrain machinery and equipment for the plants Accordingly we have reported 88 million of fixed assets for this operation as held for sale for the period ended December 31 2022 We recognized in Cost of sales pretax impairment charges of 32 million in the third quarter of 2022 to adjust the carrying value of the heldforsale assets to fair value less costs to sell We determined fair value using the market approach estimated based on the negotiated value of the assets After the sale to Tata Ford will continue to operate the powertrain facility by leasing back the associated land and building On January 10 2023 we completed the sale of the plants to Tata which will result in derecognition of the fixed assets and recognition of the powertrain facility operating lease rightofuse asset and related lease liability in the first quarter of 2023 The fair value of the cash consideration received approximated the carrying value of the fixed assets at the time of sale Skinny Labs Inc dba Spin Spin On April 1 2022 we completed the sale of Spin our whollyowned micromobility provider to TIER

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 24 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES A VIE is an entity that either i has insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or ii has equity investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest We consolidate VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary We consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE Assets recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets Liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional claims on our general assets rather they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated VIEs We have the power to direct the significant activities of an entity when our management has the ability to make key operating decisions such as decisions regarding budgets capital investment manufacturing or product development For securitization entities we have the power to direct significant activities when we have the ability to exercise discretion in the servicing of financial assets issue additional debt exercise a unilateral call option add assets to revolving structures or control investment decisions VIEs of Which We are Not the Primary Beneficiary Certain of our affiliates are VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary Our maximum exposure to any potential losses associated with these unconsolidated affiliates is limited to our equity investments accounts receivable loans and guarantees and was 28 billion and 10 billion at December 31 2021 and 2022 respectively of which 113 million of guarantees related to certain obligations of our VIEs in 2022 are also included in Note 25 The decrease in maximum exposure from December 31 2021 is primarily explained by Argo AI see Note 14 partially offset by the investment in BlueOval SK as described below On July 13 2022 Ford SK On Co Ltd and SK Battery America Inc a wholly owned subsidiary of SK On completed the creation of BlueOval SK LLC a 50 50 joint venture that will build and operate electric vehicle battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky to supply batteries to Ford and Ford affiliates BlueOval SK is a variable interest entity of which we are not the primary beneficiary and we use the equity method of accounting for our investment As of December 31 2022 Ford has contributed to BlueOval SK 691 million of its agreed capital contribution of up to 66 billion through 2026 subject to any adjustments agreed to by the parties VIEs of Which We are the Primary Beneficiary Securitization Entities Through Ford Credit we securitize transfer and service financial assets associated with consumer finance receivables operating leases and wholesale loans Our securitization transactions typically involve the legal transfer of financial assets to bankruptcy remote SPEs We generally retain a portion of the economic interests in the assetbacked securitization transactions which could be retained in the form of a portion of the senior interests the subordinated interests cash reserve accounts residual interests and servicing rights The transfers of assets in our securitization transactions do not qualify for accounting sale treatment In most cases the bankruptcy remote SPEs meet the definition of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary and therefore are consolidated We account for all securitization transactions as if they were secured financing and therefore the assets liabilities and related activity of these transactions are consolidated in our financial statements See Note 19 for additional information on the accounting for assetbacked debt and the assets securing this debt 171 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 25 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments and contingencies primarily consist of guarantees and indemnifications litigation and claims and warranty and field service actions Guarantees and Indemnifications Financial Guarantees Financial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception Subsequent to initial recognition the guarantee liability is adjusted at each reporting period to reflect the current estimate of expected payments resulting from possible default events over the remaining life of the guarantee The maximum potential payments for financial guarantees were 357 million and 518 million at December 31 2021 and 2022 respectively The carrying value of recorded liabilities related to financial guarantees was 36 million and 31 million at December 31 2021 and 2022 respectively Our financial guarantees consist of debt and lease obligations of certain joint ventures as well as certain financial obligations of outside third parties including suppliers to support our business and economic growth Expiration dates vary through 2037 and guarantees will terminate on payment andor cancellation of the underlying obligation A payment by us would be triggered by failure of the joint venture or other third party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee In some circumstances we are entitled to recover from a third party amounts paid by us under the guarantee NonFinancial Guarantees Nonfinancial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception We regularly review our performance risk under these arrangements and in the event it becomes probable we will be required to perform under a guarantee or indemnity the amount of probable payment is recorded The maximum potential payments for nonfinancial guarantees were 453 million and 273 million at December 31 2021 and 2022 respectively The carrying value of recorded liabilities related to nonfinancial guarantees was 38 million and 0 at December 31 2021 and 2022 respectively Included in the 273 million of maximum potential payments at December 31 2022 are guarantees for the resale value of vehicles sold in certain arrangements to daily rental companies The maximum potential payment of 267 million as of December 31 2022 represents the total proceeds we guarantee the rental company will receive on resale Reflecting our present estimate of proceeds the rental companies will receive on resale from third parties we do not expect we will have to pay under the guarantee In the ordinary course of business we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction such as the sale of a business These indemnifications might include and are not limited to claims relating to any of the following environmental tax and shareholder matters intellectual property rights power generation contracts governmental regulations and employmentrelated matters dealer supplier and other commercial contractual relationships and financial matters such as securitizations Performance under these indemnities generally would be triggered by a breach of contract claim brought by a counterparty including a joint venture or alliance partner or a thirdparty claim While some of these indemnifications are limited in nature many of them do not limit potential payment Therefore we are unable to estimate a maximum amount of future payments that could result from claims made under these unlimited indemnities 172 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 25 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Continued Litigation and Claims Various legal actions proceedings and claims generally matters are pending or may be instituted or asserted against us These include but are not limited to matters arising out of alleged defects in our products product warranties governmental regulations relating to safety emissions and fuel economy or other matters government incentives tax matters including trade and customs alleged illegal acts resulting in fines or penalties financial services employmentrelated matters dealer supplier and other contractual relationships intellectual property rights environmental matters shareholder or investor matters and financial reporting matters Certain of the pending legal actions are or purport to be class actions Some of the matters involve or may involve claims for compensatory punitive or antitrust or other treble damages in very large amounts or demands for field service actions environmental remediation programs sanctions loss of government incentives assessments or other relief which if granted would require very large expenditures The extent of our financial exposure to these matters is difficult to estimate Many matters do not specify a dollar amount for damages and many others specify only a jurisdictional minimum To the extent an amount is asserted our historical experience suggests that in most instances the amount asserted is not a reliable indicator of the ultimate outcome We accrue for matters when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature the specific facts and circumstances asserted the likelihood that we will prevail and the severity of any potential loss We reevaluate and update our accruals as matters progress over time For the majority of matters which generally arise out of alleged defects in our products we establish an accrual based on our extensive historical experience with similar matters We do not believe there is a reasonably possible outcome materially in excess of our accrual for these matters For the remaining matters where our historical experience with similar matters is of more limited value ie nonpattern matters we evaluate the matters primarily based on the individual facts and circumstances For nonpattern matters we evaluate whether there is a reasonable possibility of a material loss in excess of any accrual that can be estimated Our estimate of reasonably possible loss in excess of our accruals for all material matters currently reflects indirect tax customs and regulatory matters for which we estimate the aggregate risk to be a range of up to about 2 billion As noted the litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance Our assessments are based on our knowledge and experience but the ultimate outcome of any matter could require payment substantially in excess of the amount that we have accrued andor disclosed 173 FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 25 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Continued Warranty and Field Service Actions We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model using historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model using historical information regarding the nature frequency severity and average cost of claims for each model year In addition from time to time we issue extended warranties at our expense the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance Warranty and field service action obligations are reported in Other liabilities and deferred revenue We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis We recognize the benefit from a recovery of the costs associated with our warranty and field service actions when specifics of the recovery have been agreed with our supplier and the amount of recovery is virtually certain Recoveries are reported in Trade and other receivables net and Other assets The estimate of our future warranty and field service action costs net of estimated supplier recoveries for the years ended December 31 was as follows in millions 2021 2022 Beginning
