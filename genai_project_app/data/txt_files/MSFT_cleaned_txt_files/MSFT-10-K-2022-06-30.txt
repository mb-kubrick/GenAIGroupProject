2021 was a year of both successes and challenges While we continued to make progress on several of our goals with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions our Scope 3 emissions increased due in substantial part to significant global datacenter expansions and growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the COVID19 pandemic Despite these Scope 3 increases we will continue to build the foundations and do the work to deliver on our commitments and help our customers and partners achieve theirs We have learned the impact of our work will not all be felt

display advertising to a global audience We have several partnerships with other companies including Yahoo through which we provide and monetize search queries Growth depends on our ability to attract new users understand intent and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings On June 6 2022 we acquired Xandr Inc a technology platform with tools to accelerate the delivery of our digital advertising solutions Competition Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices mainly from Apple and Google We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice value flexibility security an easytouse interface and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications including those that enable productivity 15 PART I Item 1 Devices face competition from various computer tablet and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of highquality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points These manufacturers many of which are also current or potential partners and customers include Apple and our Windows OEMs Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services including those operated by Amazon Apple Meta Google and Tencent We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony both of which have a large established base of customers We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against and uniquely differentiated from competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture user interface developer tools online gaming and entertainment services and continued strong exclusive content from our own firstparty game franchises as well as other digital content offerings Our Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites social platforms like Meta and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users OPERATIONS We have operations centers that support operations in their regions including customer contract and order processing credit and collections information processing and vendor management and logistics The regional center in Ireland supports the European Middle Eastern and African region the center in Singapore supports the Japan India Greater China and AsiaPacific region and the centers in Fargo North Dakota Fort Lauderdale Florida Puerto Rico Redmond Washington and Reno Nevada support Latin America and North America In addition to the operations centers we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas Europe Australia and Asia as well as in the Middle East and Africa To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface altering dialog boxes and translating text Our devices are primarily manufactured by thirdparty contract manufacturers For the majority of our products we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements However some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers For these components we have limited nearterm flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements Extended disruptions at these suppliers andor manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Product and Service Development and Intellectual Property We develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups Cloud and AI focuses on making IT professionals developers and their systems more productive and efficient through development of cloud infrastructure server database CRM ERP software development tools and services including GitHub AI cognitive services and other business process applications and services for enterprises Experiences and Devices focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our enduser experiences and devices including Office Windows Teams con sumer web experiences including search and news advertising and the Surface line of devices Security Compliance Identity and Management focuses on cloud platform and application security identity and network access enterprise mobility information protection and managed services Technology and Research focuses on our AI innovations and other forwardlooking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure services and applications LinkedIn focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire market sell and learn Gaming focuses on developing hardware content and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction 16 PART I Item 1 Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design Before releasing new software platforms and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development training and testing Generally we also create product documentation internally We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways We work actively in the US and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright trademark trade secret and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products services business plans and branding We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 69000 US and international patents issued and over 19000 pending worldwide While we employ much of our internallydeveloped intellectual property exclusively in our products and services we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees products From time to time we enter into broader crosslicense agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services At times we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective such as promoting industry standards advancing interoperability supporting societal andor environmental efforts or attracting and enabling our external development community Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products services and business methods we believe based upon past experience and industry practice such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products Investing in the Future Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products services and experiences for our users to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends to enter new geographic and product markets and to drive broad adoption of our products and services We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the Company Based on our assessment of key technology trends we maintain our longterm commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies tools and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences cloud computing AI devices and operating systems While our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond Washington we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the US and around the world This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities and as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the Company In addition to our main research and development operations we also operate Microsoft Research Microsoft Research is one of the worlds largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the stateoftheart in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines providing us a unique perspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation DISTRIBUTION SALES AND MARKETING We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels OEMs direct and distributors and resellers Our sales force performs a variety of functions including working directly with commercial enterprises and publicsector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements managing OEM relationships and supporting system integrators independent software vendors and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales consulting and fulfillment functions for our products and services 17 PART I Item 1 OEMs We distribute our products and services through OEMs that preinstall our software on new devices and servers they sell The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system preinstalled on devices OEMs also sell devices preinstalled with other Microsoft products and services including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365 There are two broad categories of OEMs The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs including Dell HewlettPackard Lenovo and with many regional and local OEMs The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lowervolume PC manufacturers which source Microsoft software for preinstallation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft Direct Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts with sales support from system integrators independent software vendors web agencies and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors or ESA Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small medium and corporate customers in addition to those offered through the reseller channel A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers such as cloud services search and gaming through our digital marketplaces

engagement with our partners and customers across industries Distributors and Resellers Organizations also license our products and services indirectly primarily through licensing solution partners LSP distributors valueadded resellers VAR and retailers Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations distributors resell primarily to VARs and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent nonexclusive distributors authorized replicators resellers and retail outlets Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets We distribute our devices through thirdparty retailers We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services LICENSING OPTIONS We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services onpremises software and SA We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having

in Microsoft to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our Investor Relations website 22 PART I Item 1A ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common stock STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resources Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products devices and services that appeal to businesses and consumers Competition among platformbased ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platformbased ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions A wellestablished ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users application developers and the platform provider that can accelerate growth Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms A competing verticallyintegrated model in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers tablets phones gaming consoles wearables and other endpoint devices Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer We also offer some verticallyintegrated hardware and software products and services To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength In addition some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer OEM partners which may affect their commitment to our platform Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms To compete we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality security customer appeal and value Efforts to compete with competitors content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins Competitors rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives 23 PART I Item 1A Business model competition Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure platform and softwareasaservice business model the licensebased proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model Other competitors develop and offer free applications online services and content and make money by selling thirdparty advertising Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost competing directly with our revenuegenerating products Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software Some open source software mimics the features and functionality of our products The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs such as for research and development marketing and sales incentives This may lead to lower revenue gross margins and operating income Our increasing focus on cloudbased services presents execution and competitive risks A growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building bestinclass platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence AI At the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services for consumers and business customers Pricing and delivery models are evolving Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the users choice of which cloudbased services to use We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloudbased strategies The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things IoT Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure Azure Stack Azure IoT Edge and Azure Sphere We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives Besides software development costs we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved Whether we succeed in cloudbased services depends on our execution in several areas including Continuing to bring to market compelling cloudbased experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share Maintaining the utility compatibility and performance of our cloudbased services on the growing array of computing devices including PCs smartphones tablets gaming consoles and other devices as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to thirdparty developers Ensuring our cloudbased services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs Making our suite of cloudbased services platformagnostic available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems including those of our competitors It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income 24 PART I Item 1A RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns We will continue to make significant investments in research development and marketing for existing products services and technologies including the Windows operating system Microsoft 365 Office Bing SQL Server Windows Server Azure Office 365 Xbox LinkedIn and other products and services We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including PCs tablets gaming devices and HoloLens Investments in new technology are speculative Commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades unfavorably affecting revenue We may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investments for several years if at all New products and services may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically We may not get engagement in certain features like Edge and Bing that drive postsale monetization opportunities Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences could negatively impact product and feature adoption product design and product quality Developing new technologies is complex It can require long development and testing periods Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue Acquisitions joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our longterm business strategy For example in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc for 81 billion and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications Inc for 188 billion In January 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc for 687 billion These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that they raise new compliancerelated obligations and challenges that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees business systems and technology that they distract management from our other businesses or that announced transactions may not be completed If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones as well as acquired companies ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance privacy and cybersecurity It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable We test goodwill for impairment at least annually Factors that may be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate We have in the past recorded and may in the future be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined negatively affecting our results of operations 25 PART I Item 1A CYBERSECURITY DATA PRIVACY AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our reputation or competitive position Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations including statesponsored organizations or nationstates continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT These actors may use a wide variety of methods which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware software or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters using social engineering techniques to induce our employees users partners or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users or customers data or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks Nationstate and statesponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits Nationstate attacks against us or our customers may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data For example system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users security or systems or reveal confidential information Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers Breaches of our facilities network or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets subject us to ransomware attacks require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks or otherwise adversely affect our business The cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as Solorigate or Nobelium are an example of a supply chain attack where malware was introduced to a software providers customers including us through software updates The attackers were later able to create false credentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers systems We may be targets of further attacks similar to SolorigateNobelium as both a supplier and consumer of IT In addition our internal IT environment continues to evolve Often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumeroriented technologies Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide 26 PART I Item 1A Security of our products services devices and customers data The security of our products and services is important in our customers decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and onpremises environments Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers Customers using our cloudbased services rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other elements provided by third parties to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems programs and services including many of ours and we expect that to continue In addition adversaries can attack our customers onpremises or cloud environments sometimes exploiting previously unknown zero day vulnerabilities such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server onpremises products Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers systems Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users accounts including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customers use of our products or services We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks Our customers operate complex IT systems with thirdparty hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards As a result we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product service standard or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers vulnerability to attack Further customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies In addition we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services including security default settings as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults Cyberattacks such as SolorigateNobelium may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have available information and actions for customers to help protect themselves We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection tracking and remediation We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack especially where an attack involves onpremises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers computing environments Development and deployment of defensive measures To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems our cloudbased services and our customers systems we must continuously engineer more secure products and services enhance security and reliability features improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network products and services and provide security tools such as firewalls antivirus software and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so Customers in certain industries such as financial services health care and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services 27 PART I Item 1A The cost of measures to protect products and customerfacing services could reduce our operating margins If we fail to do these things well actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services data corruption issues or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services or to use competing products or services Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack which could delay adoption of additional products or services Customers and third parties granted access to their systems may fail to update their systems continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support or may fail timely to install or enable security patches or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges At times to achieve commercial objectives we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is a security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation As we continue to grow the number breadth and scale of our cloudbased offerings we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users The continued occurrence of highprofile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies it is possible our security controls over personal data our training of employees and third parties on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage In addition third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customers or users or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data onpremises or increasingly in a cloudbased environment we host Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders In the US and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data perceptions that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloudbased solutions by consumers businesses and government entities Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures In certain cases we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit thus diminishing the value of our products and services Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement Advertising professional marketplace and gaming platform abuses For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties including GitHub LinkedIn Microsoft Advertising Microsoft News Microsoft Store Bing and Xbox our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements 28 PART I Item 1A Other digital safety abuses Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law We may not proactively discover such content due to scale the limitations of existing technologies and conflicting legal frameworks When discovered by users such content may negatively affect our reputation our brands and user engagement Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted and we expect this to continue We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight civil or criminal liability or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements The development of the IoT presents security privacy and execution risks To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge we are developing products services and technologies to power the IoT a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors data and computing capabilities including AI The IoTs great potential also carries substantial risks IoT products and services may contain defects in design manufacture or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware sensors processors software and firmware several of which we may not develop or control Each layer including the weakest layer can impact the security of the whole system Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended violate the law or harm individuals or businesses we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions These risks if realized may increase our costs damage our reputation or brands or negatively impact our revenues or margins Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm or liability We are building AI into many of our offerings including our productivity services and we are also making first and thirdparty AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build We expect these elements of our business to grow We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices applications and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives As with many innovations AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business AI algorithms may be flawed Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals or society These deficiencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm regulatory action legal liability including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union EU and brand or reputational harm Some AI scenarios present ethical issues If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights privacy employment or other social economic or political issues we may experience brand or reputational harm OPERATIONAL RISKS We may have excessive outages data losses and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure Our increasing user traffic growth in services and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power We spend substantial amounts to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters Our datacenters depend on predictable energy and networking supplies the cost or availability of which could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including the transition to a clean energy economy and geopolitical disruptions These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing Azure Microsoft Account services Microsoft 365 Microsoft Teams Dynamics 365 OneDrive SharePoint Online Skype Xbox and Outlookcom We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and backend hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users Maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve Inefficiencies or operational failures including temporary or permanent loss of customer data insufficient Internet connectivity or inadequate storage and compute capacity could diminish the quality of our products services and user experience resulting in contractual liability claims by customers and other third parties regulatory actions damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users subscribers and advertisers each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements 29 PART I Item 1A We may experience quality or supply problems Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles Surface devices and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design manufacture or associated software We could incur significant expenses lost revenue and reputational harm as a result of recalls safety alerts or product liability claims if we fail to prevent detect or address such issues through design testing or warranty repairs Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues Any defects we do not detect and fix in prerelease testing could cause reduced sales and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation costs delays in the release of new products or versions or legal liability Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us If components are delayed or become unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint industry shortages legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources or other reasons we may not obtain timely replacement supplies resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity Component shortages excess or obsolete inventory or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue Xbox consoles Surface devices datacenter servers and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins LEGAL REGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products As a leading global software and device maker government agencies closely scrutinize us under US and foreign competition laws Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU the US and China Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct US federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business The European Commission the Commission closely scrutinizes the design of highvolume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products such as file formats programming interfaces and protocols available to other companies Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws For example in 2004 the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products In 2009 the Commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the Commissions concerns relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability The web browsing commitments expired in 2014 The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform and increase our product development costs The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products which could hamper sales of our products Our portfolio of firstparty devices continues to grow at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms As a result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase Certain foreign governments particularly in China and other countries in Asia have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property 30 PART I Item 1A Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come s from them New competition law actions could be initiated potentially using previous actions as precedent The outcome of such actions or steps taken to avoid them could adversely affect us in a variety of ways including We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders consent decrees or other voluntary actions we have taken If we fail to comply with these commitments we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions Our ability to realize anticipated Windows postsale monetization opportunities may be limited Regulatory scrutiny may inhibit our ability to consummate acquisitions or impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of such transactions Our global operations subject us to potential consequences under anticorruption trade and other laws and regulations The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and other anticorruption laws and regulations AntiCorruption Laws prohibit corrupt payments by our employees vendors or agents and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls From time to time we receive inquiries from authorities in the US and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the US and our compliance with AntiCorruption Laws Periodically we receive such reports directly and investigate them and also cooperate with investigations by US and foreign law enforcement authorities An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive initiated in 2021 which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by EU member states Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves While we devote substantial resources to our US and international compliance programs and have implemented policies training and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity our employees vendors or agents may violate our policies Our failure to comply with AntiCorruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation Increasing trade laws policies sanctions and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the US relating to trade and investment Economic sanctions in the US the EU and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries such as Crimea Cuba Iran North Korea and Syria US export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to or making investments in certain entities in specified countries US import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine may result in 1 new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries and 2 negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers partners and us Noncompliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm operational delays monetary fines loss of revenues increased costs loss of export privileges or criminal sanctions 31 PART I Item 1A Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include requirements related to user privacy telecommunications data storage and protection advertising and online content For example some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as Microsoft Teams and Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services and some new laws including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection security and law enforcement surveillance obligations Regulators may assert that our collection use and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop implement or secure our products and services Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the area s of AI and content moderation which could increase costs or restrict opportunity Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction Additionally these laws and governments approach to their enforcement and our products and services are continuing to evolve Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups regulators competitors customers and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible If our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs legal claims fines against us or reputational damage The growth of our Internet and cloudbased services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries Legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve For example in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated a framework called Privacy Shield for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the United States This ruling continues to generate uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU under other legal mechanisms and has resulted in some EU data protection authorities blocking the use of USbased services that involve the transfer of data to the US The US and the EU in March 2022 agreed in principle on a replacement framework for the Privacy Shield called the TransAtlantic Data Privacy Framework A failure of the US and EU to finalize the TransAtlantic Data Privacy Framework could compound that uncertainty and result in additional blockages of data transfers Potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets For example the EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data More recently the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data including in the Digital Markets Act the Digital Services Act and the Data Act that will add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR and other data regulations or if our implementation to comply with the GDPR makes our offerings less attractive Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them If we fail to comply or if regulators assert we have failed to comply including in response to complaints made by customers it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue in the case of GDPR private lawsuits reputational damage blockage of international data transfers and loss of customers The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing especially against large technology companies Jurisdictions around the world such as China India and states in the US have adopted or are considering adopting or expanding laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling or transfer of personal data 32 PART I Item 1A The Companys investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment Ongoing legal analyses reviews and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices or relevant practices of other organizations may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements including data sovereignty and localization requirements affecting the location movement collection and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services business practices or internal systems that result in increased costs lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreignbased firms Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives including major new product releases such as Windows significant business transactions warranty or product claims and employment practices Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties We derive substantial revenue from government contracts Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements For instance we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval reductions or delays which could adversely impact publicsector demand for our products and services These events could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and reputation We may have additional tax liabilities We are subject to income taxes in the US and many foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes In the course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain For example compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes and as we gather more information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken In addition economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing The final resolution of those audits and other audits or litigation may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the US A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in our business or structure or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company In addition changes in US federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries including in the US and changes in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements 33 PART I Item 1A INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure Source code the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs is critical to our business Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code If our source code leaks we might lose future trade secret protection for that code It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors Legal changes our evolving business model piracy and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult While piracy adversely affects US revenue the impact on revenue from outside the US is more significant particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights Our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market Similarly the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights Throughout the world we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or in some instances by licensing or crosslicensing our patents to others in return for a royalty andor increased freedom to operate Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents Similarly licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations The royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology price changes in products using licensed patents greater value from crosslicensing or the difficulty of discovering infringements Finally our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights From time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and our offering of firstparty devices such as Surface To resolve these claims we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected products or services or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline Besides money damages in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies In some countries such as Germany an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so GENERAL RISKS If our reputation or our brands are damaged our business and operating results may be harmed Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer business and publicsector customers There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged These include product safety or quality issues our environmental impact and sustainability supply chain practices or human rights record We may experience backlash from customers government entities advocacy groups employees and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from among other things The introduction of new features products services or terms of service that customers users or partners do not like 34 PART I Item 1A Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy data practices or content Data security breaches compliance failures or actions of partners or individual employees The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood speed and magnitude of negative brand events If our brands or reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our revenues or margins or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business Worsening economic conditions including inflation recession pandemic or other changes in economic conditions may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue If demand for PCs servers and other computing devices declines or consumer or business spending for those products declines our revenue will be adversely affected Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution The impact of economic conditions on our partners such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor OEM or retailer could cause sales channel disruption Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased As a result allowances for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable may increase We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities These investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises US government securities If global financial markets decline for long periods or if there is a downgrade of the US government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales providing services or performing other critical functions Our corporate headquarters a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle Washington area and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California both of which are seismically active regions A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems or the infrastructure or systems they rely on such as power grids could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements Abrupt political change terrorist activity and armed conflict such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies access to national regional and global markets hiring and profitability Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some publicsector customers Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic such as COVID19 may adversely affect our operations financial condition and results of operations The COVID19 pandemic has had widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals actions in response to the pandemic and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability 35 PART I Item 1A Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors Any of these measures may adversely impact our ability to Maintain our operations infrastructure including the reliability and adequate capacity of cloud services Satisfy our contractual and regulatory compliance obligations as we adapt to changing usage patterns such as through datacenter load balancing Ensure a highquality and consistent supply chain and manufacturing operations for our hardware devices and datacenter operations Effectively manage our international operations through changes in trade practices and policies Hire and deploy people where we most need them Sustain the effectiveness and productivity of our operations including our sales marketing engineering and distribution functions We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business If we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our revenues cash flows market share growth and reputation The longterm effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear Environmental regulations or changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our business Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloudbased services Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales The global nature of our business creates operational economic and geopolitical risks Our results of operations may be affected by global regional and local economic developments monetary policy inflation and recession as well as political and military disputes In addition our international growth strategy includes certain markets the developing nature of which presents several risks including deterioration of social political labor or economic conditions in a country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism protectionism or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs local sourcing initiatives and nonlocal sourcing restrictions export controls investment restrictions or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive Maintaining our brand and reputation as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws Changes to US immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected Effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution How employmentrelated laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs Our global workforce is primarily nonunionized but we have several unions and works councils outside of the United States In the US there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union While Microsoft has not received such petitions in the US the unionization of significant employee

discussion Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive with frequent changes in both technologies and business models Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products new technologies or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business At Microsoft we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users industry trends and competitive forces 40 PART II Item 7 Economic Conditions Challenges and Risks The markets for software devices and cloudbased services are dynamic and highly competitive Our competitors are developing new software and devices while also deploying competing cloudbased services for consumers and businesses The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the users choice of which suite of cloudbased services to use We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment broad customer reach scale in resources the ability to grow ones career across many different products and businesses and competitive compensation and benefits Aggregate demand for our software services and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors which remain dynamic Our devices are primarily manufactured by thirdparty contract manufacturers some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers For these components we have limited nearterm flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements Extended disruptions at these suppliers andor manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar As a result changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses Fluctuations in the US dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022 Refer to Risk Factors Part I Item 1A of this Form 10K for a discussion of these factors and other risks Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate yearend spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multiyear onpremises contracts executed during the period Reportable Segments We report our financial performance based on the following segments Productivity and Business Processes Intelligent Cloud and More

1186 We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies equity prices interest rates and credit enhance investment returns and facilitate portfolio diversification Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income expense net Interest and dividends income decreased due to lower portfolio balances Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding longterm debt due to debt maturities Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on equity securities INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was 13 and 14 respectively The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a 33 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the US and foreign countries as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellent Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax an agreement between the US and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA regulations In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the US The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a 33 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 as the value of future US tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the US global intangible lowtaxed income tax We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India In March 2021 the India Supreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals some dating back to 2012 holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes Although we were not a party to the appeals our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes Therefore we recorded a net income tax benefit of 620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016 Our effective tax rate was lower than the US federal statutory rate primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland and tax benefits relating to stockbased compensation The mix of income before income taxes between the US and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of and customer demand for our products and services In fiscal year 2022 our US income before income taxes was 478 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 359 billion In fiscal year 2021 our US income before income taxes was 350 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was 361 billion 47 PART II Item 7 Uncertain Tax Positions We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011 In February 2012 the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016 and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018 In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of 17 billion including tax and interest We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017 As of June 30 2022 the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months Based on the information currently available we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the US Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2021 some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements NONGAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are nonGAAP financial measures which exclude the net tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the net income tax benefit related to an India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 We believe these nonGAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business For comparability of reporting management considers nonGAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance These nonGAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to nonGAAP financial results In millions except percentages and per share amounts 2022 2021 Percentage Change Net income 72738 61271 19 Net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties 3291 0 Net income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on

expect existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments cash flows from operations and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities such as dividends share repurchases debt maturities material capital expenditures and the transition tax related to the TCJA for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future Cash Cash Equivalents and Investments Cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 1048 billion and 1303 billion as of June 30 2022 and 2021 respectively Equity investments were 69 billion and 60 billion as of June 30 2022 and 2021 respectively Our shortterm investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation They consist predominantly of highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers The investments are predominantly US dollardenominated securities but also include foreign currencydenominated securities to diversify risk Our fixedincome investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk The credit risk and average maturity of our fixedincome portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixedincome indices The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the shortterm investments held are primarily highly liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities Valuation In general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments such as US government securities common and preferred stock and mutual funds If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments such as commercial paper certificates of deposit US agency securities foreign government bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities corporate notes and bonds and municipal securities Level 3 investments are valued using internallydeveloped models with unobservable inputs Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades Our brokerpriced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments In addition all our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded These controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate Cash Flows Cash from operations increased 123 billion to 890 billion for fiscal year 2022 mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees Cash used in financing increased 104 billion to 589 billion for fiscal year 2022 mainly due to a 53 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a 53 billion increase in repayments of debt Cash used in investing increased 27 billion to 303 billion for fiscal year 2022 mainly due to a 131 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies net of cash acquired and purchases of intangible and other assets and a 33 billion increase in additions to property and equipment offset in part by a 156 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases sales and maturities 49 PART II Item 7 Debt Proceeds We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes which may include among other things funding for working capital capital expenditures repurchases of capital stock acquisitions and repayment of existing debt In March 2021 and June 2020 we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment Refer to Note 11 Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K for further discussion Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue

transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to US income tax Under the TCJA the transition tax is payable in interestfree installments over eight years with 8 due in each of the first five years 15 in year six 20 in year seven and 25 in year eight We have paid transition tax of 62 billion which included 15 billion for fiscal year 2022 The remaining transition tax of 120 billion is payable over the next four years with 13 billion payable within 12 months Provisions enacted in the TCJA related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental expenditures became effective on July 1 2022 These provisions require us to capitalize research and experimental expenditures and amortize them on the US tax return over five or fifteen years depending on where research is conducted The final foreign tax credit regulations also effective on July 1 2022 introduced significant changes to foreign tax credit calculations in the US tax return While these provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate on a net basis our cash paid for taxes would increase unless these provisions are postponed or modified through legislative processes Share Repurchases During fiscal years 2022 and 2021 we repurchased 95 million shares and 101 million shares of our common stock for 280 billion and 230 billion respectively through our share repurchase programs All repurchases were made using cash resources As of June 30 2022 407 billion remained of our 60 billion share repurchase program Refer to Note 16 Stockholders Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K for further discussion Dividends During fiscal year 2022 our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of 062 per share We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends subject to declaration by our Board of Directors Refer to Note 16 Stockholders Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K for further discussion 51 PART II Item 7 Other Planned Uses of Capital On January 18 2022 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc Activision Blizzard for 95 00 per share in an allcash transaction valued at 68 7 billion inclusive of Activision Blizzards net cash The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzards shareholders and we expect it to close in fiscal year 2023 subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions We will continue to invest in sales marketing product support infrastructure and existing and advanced areas of technology as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy Additions to property and equipment will continue including new facilities datacenters and computer systems for research and development sales and marketing support and administrative staff We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings We have operating and finance leases for datacenters corporate offices research and development facilities Microsoft Experience Centers and certain equipment We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE Refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K for further discussion CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition impairment of investment securities goodwill research and development costs legal and other contingencies income taxes and inventories Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment When a cloudbased service includes both onpremises software licenses and cloud services judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time Certain cloud services primarily Office 365 depend on a significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services and are accounted for together as one performance obligation Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price SSP for each distinct performance obligation We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately including onpremises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services In instances where SSP is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances In these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers 52 PART II Item 7 Our products are generally sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or incentives and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented Impairment of Investment Securities We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost This determination requires significant judgment In making this judgment we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments In addition we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established If market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss Once an investment is determined to be impaired an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis May 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology This analysis requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts estimation of the longterm rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results market conditions and other factors Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product Once technological feasibility is established software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all highrisk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing Generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to production The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 53 PART II Item 7 Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factors the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions and income tax disclosures Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion disposal and transportation We regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts product life cycle status product development plans current sales levels pricing strategy and component cost trends If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE In July 2022 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment as well as advances in technology we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023 Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment net as of June 30 2022 it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2023 operating income by 37 billion We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020 54 PART

prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets consolidated income statements or consolidated cash flows statements Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses Examples of estimates and assumptions include for revenue recognition determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and determining the standalone selling price SSP of performance obligations variable consideration and other obligations such as product returns and refunds loss contingencies product warranties the fair value of andor potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units product life cycles useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets allowances for doubtful accounts the market value of and demand for our inventory stockbased compensation forfeiture rates when technological feasibility is achieved for our products the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties In July 2022 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment as well as advances in technology we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023 We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020 Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems crossdevice productivity applications server applications business solution applications desktop and server management tools software development tools video games and hardware such as PCs tablets gaming and entertainment consoles other intelligent devices and related accessories Service and other revenue includes sales from cloudbased solutions that provide customers with software services platforms and content such as Office 365 Azure Dynamics 365 and Xbox solution support and consulting services Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn 62 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities Nature of Products and Services Licenses for onpremises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software Revenue from distinct onpremises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge revenue is recognized as the updates are provided which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license Certain volume licensing programs including Enterprise Agreements include onpremises licenses combined with Software Assurance SA SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support tools and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently Onpremises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time Cloud services which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis such as the amount of storage used in a period is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided Our hardware is generally highly dependent on and interrelated with the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system In these cases the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces Refer to Note 19 Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information including revenue by significant product and service offering Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment When a cloudbased service includes both onpremises software licenses and cloud services judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time Certain cloud services primarily Office 365 depend on a significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services and are accounted for together as one performance obligation Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided 63 PART II Item 8 Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately including onpremises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services In instances where SSP is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances In these instances we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers Our products are generally sold with a right of return we may provide other credits or incentives and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing For multiyear agreements we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multiyear onpremises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs which may include SA and cloud services Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multiyear agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future LinkedIn subscriptions Office 365 subscriptions Xbox subscriptions Windows postdelivery support Dynamics business solutions and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service Refer to Note 13 Unearned Revenue for further information including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period and multiyear onpremises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront As of June 30 2022 and 2021 other receivables due from suppliers were 10 billion and 965 million respectively and are included in accounts receivable net in our consolidated balance sheets As of June 30 2022 and 2021 longterm accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was 38 billion and 34 billion respectively and is included in other longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts historical experience and other currently available evidence 64

products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries As of June 30 2022 and 2021 our financing receivables net were 41 billion and 44 billion respectively for shortterm and longterm financing receivables which are included in other current assets and other longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts historical experience and other currently available evidence Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers OEM to drive traffic to our websites and to acquire online advertising space costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services including datacenter costs and royalties warranty costs inventory valuation adjustments costs associated with the delivery of consulting services and the amortization of capitalized software development costs Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized For hardware warranties we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates historical and projected repair costs and knowledge of specific product failures if any The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years For software warranties we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes such as security patches over the estimated life of the software We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 65 PART II Item 8 Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll employee benefits stockbased compensation expense and other headcountrelated expenses associated with product development Research and development expenses also include thirdparty development and programming costs localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets and the amortization of purchased software code and services content Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached which for our software products is generally shortly before the products are released to production Once technological feasibility is reached such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll employee benefits stockbased compensation expense and other headcountrelated expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel and the costs of advertising promotions trade shows seminars and other programs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred Advertising expense was 15 billion 15 billion and 16 billion in fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively StockBased Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards which include restricted stock units RSUs and performance stock units PSUs is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense net of estimated forfeitures over the related service or performance period The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straightline method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan ESPP is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase Income Taxes Income tax expense includes US and international income taxes and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized All deferred income taxes are classified as longterm in our consolidated balance sheets Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interestearning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values In general investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as shortterm investments Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as shortterm based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 66 PART II Item 8 Debt investments are classified as availableforsale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method Changes in fair value excluding credit losses and impairments are recorded in other comprehensive income Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions credit quality of debt instrument issuers and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost To determine credit losses we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence In addition we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income expense net and a new cost basis in the investment is established If market industry andor investee conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments referred to as the measurement alternative We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value Changes in value are recorded in other income expense net Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges gains and losses are recognized in other income expense net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income expense net For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income expense net with the corresponding hedged item Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income expense net For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income expense net Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety These levels are Level 1 inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets Our Level 1 investments include US government securities common and preferred stock and mutual funds Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges Level 2 inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques eg the BlackScholes model for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities Where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves credit spreads foreign exchange rates and forward and spot prices for currencies Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper certificates of deposit US agency securities foreign government bonds mortgage and assetbacked securities corporate notes and bonds and municipal securities Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain overthecounter forward option and swap contracts 67 PART II Item 8 Level 3 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability The fair values are therefore determined using modelbased techniques including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds municipal securities and goodwill and intangible assets when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available and may include quoted market prices market comparables and discounted cash flow projections Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion disposal and transportation We regularly review inventory quantities on hand future purchase commitments with our suppliers and the estimated utility of our inventory If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows computer software developed or acquired for internal use three to seven years computer equipment two to four years buildings and improvements five to 15 years leasehold improvements three to 20 years and furniture and equipment one to 10 years Land is not depreciated Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception Operating leases are included in operating lease rightofuse ROU assets other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets Finance leases are included in property and equipment other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term We have lease agreements with lease and nonlease components which are generally accounted for separately For certain equipment leases such as vehicles we account for the lease and nonlease components as a single lease component Additionally for certain equipment leases we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis May 1 for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 68 PART II Item 8 Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated period of benefit ranging from one to 20 years We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired Recent Accounting Guidance Accounting for Income Taxes In December 2019 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for income taxes The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries The guidance also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a stepup in the tax basis of goodwill We adopted the standard effective July 1 2021 Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements NOTE 2

rates equity prices and credit to enhance investment returns and to facilitate portfolio diversification Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing eliminating and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions Foreign currency risks related to certain nonUS dollardenominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments Foreign currency risks related to certain Eurodenominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures Interest Rate Interest rate risks related to certain fixedrate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates 73 PART II Item 8 Securities held in our fixedincome portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities We manage the average maturity of our fixedincome portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broadbased fixedincome indices using exchangetraded option and futures contracts and overthecounter swap and option contracts These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in Other contracts in the tables below Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk At times we may hold options futures and swap contracts These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in Other contracts in the tables below Credit Our

properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the US The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a 33 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 as the value of future US tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the US global intangible lowtaxed income GILTI tax 82 PART II Item 8 We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India In March 2021 the India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in 86 separate appeals some dating back to 2012 holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes Although we were not a party to the appeals our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes Therefore we recorded a net income tax benefit of 620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016 The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland and tax benefits relating to stockbased compensation The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico tax benefits relating to stockbased compensation and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico and tax benefits relating to stockbased compensation In fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico which are taxed at rates lower than the US rate generated 71 82 and 86 of our foreign income before tax Other reconciling items net consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax and in fiscal year 2021 includes tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes In fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 there were no individually significant other reconciling items The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a 33 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the US and foreign countries as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes an agreement between the US and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA regulations The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes an agreement between the US and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing final TCJA regulations and an increase in tax benefits relating to stockbased compensation 83 PART II Item 8 The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows In millions June

and made a payment of 17 billion including tax and interest We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017 As of June 30 2022 the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months Based on the information currently available we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the US Our

Investigatio n In 2014 Microsoft was informed that Chinas State Agency for Market Regulation SAMR formerly State Administration for Industry and Commerce had begun a formal investigation relating to Chinas AntiMonopoly Law and the SAMR conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing Shanghai Guangzhou and Chengdu In 2019 the SAMR presented preliminary views as to certain possible violations of Chinas AntiMonopoly Law ProductRelated Litigation US Cell Phone Litigation Microsoft Mobile Oy a subsidiary of Microsoft along with other handset manufacturers and network operators is a defendant in 46 lawsuits including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokias Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pretrial proceedings the remaining cases are stayed In a separate 2009 decision the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the US Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines FCC Guidelines are preempted by federal law The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect The lawsuits also allege an industrywide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines In 2013 the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies In 2014 the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion to exclude the plaintiffs general causation experts The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence In October 2016 the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence portions of which the defendants have moved to strike In August 2018 the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs expert reports A hearing on general causation is scheduled for September of 2022 Other Contingencies We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us individually or in aggregate will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future As of June 30 2022 we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of 364 million While we intend to defend these matters vigorously adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately 600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable 88 PART II Item 8 NOTE 16
