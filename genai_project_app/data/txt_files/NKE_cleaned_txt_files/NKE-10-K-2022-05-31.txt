Part I Item 1 Business FISCAL 2022 OVERVIEW In fiscal 2022 NIKE Inc achieved record Revenues of 467 billion which increased 5 and 6 on a reported and currencyneutral basis respectively driven by higher revenues in EMEA North America and APLA partially offset by declines in Greater China The NIKE Brand which represents over 90 of NIKE Inc Revenues increased 5 and 6 on a reported and currencyneutral basis respectively compared to fiscal 2021 NIKE Direct grew 14 and 15 on a reported and currencyneutral basis respectively driven by an increase of 18 in NIKE Brand Digital as growth in North America APLA and EMEA was partially offset by a decline in Greater China Wholesale revenues declined 1 as declines in North America and Greater China were partially offset by growth in EMEA and APLA Revenues for Converse increased 6 and 7 on a reported and currencyneutral basis respecti vely led by doubledigit growth in our direct to consumer business partially offset by lower wholesale revenues Income before income taxes remained flat for fiscal 2022 as higher revenues and gross margin expansion were offset by higher selling and administrative expense NIKE Inc gross margin increased 120 basis points led by margin expansion in our NIKE Direct business a higher mix of fullprice sales and favorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates including hedges partially offset by elevated freight and logistics costs and higher inventory obsolescence reserves primarily recognized in Greater China in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher Operating overhead and Demand creation expense Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to higher strategic technology investments as well as increases in wagerelated expenses and NIKE Direct variable costs This activity was partially offset by higher restructuringrelated costs in the prior year related to our organizational realignment For more information see Note 21 Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Demand creation expense increased primarily due to normalization of spend against brand campaigns and continued investments in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand ROIC as of May 31 2022 was 465 compared to 488 as of May 31 2021 ROIC is considered a nonGAAP financial measure see Use of NonGAAP Financial Measures for further information During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we entered into separate definitive agreements to sell our legal entities in Argentina and Uruguay as well as our legal entity in Chile to thirdparty distributors The assets and liabilities of these entities will remain classified as heldforsale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the transactions close which is expected to occur prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023 For more information related to our planned distributor partnership transition within APLA see Note 20 Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements In future quarters as we shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor operating model within these countries we expect consolidated NIKE Inc and APLA revenue growth will be reduced due to differences in commercial terms However over time we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses as well as lessen exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility Economic sanctions imposed on Russia during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 impacted our local business and a reduction in the Ruble liquidity affected our ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk As a result we deconsolidated our Russian legal entities the net revenues of which were less than one percent of consolidated net Revenues for fiscal 2021 The deconsolidation of our Russian legal entities resulted in a onetime pretax charge of 96 million recognized within Other income expense net classified within Corporate Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022 we made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace While foreign currency markets remain volatile in part due to geopolitical dynamics which have led to a stronger US Dollar we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability We remain committed to effectively managing our business and mitigating financial market risks to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 refer to Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion

On a currencyneutral basis APLA revenues increased 16 for fiscal 2022 The increase was due to higher revenues across nearly all territories driven by SOCO which comprises Argentina Chile and Uruguay Mexico and Korea which increased 58 35 and 16 respectively Revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues in Mens and Womens NIKE Direct revenues increased 30 primarily due to digital sales growth of 51 and comparable store sales growth of 13 in part due to improved physical retail traffic partially offset by store closures Currencyneutral footwear revenues increased 17 for fiscal 2022 in part due to higher revenues in Womens and Mens Unit sales of footwear increased 2 while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 15 percentage points of footwear revenue growth Higher ASP per pair was driven by higher NIKE Direct ASP higher fullprice ASP reflecting lower discounts higher offprice ASP and a higher mix of fullprice sales Higher ASPs in part reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory Currencyneutral apparel revenues increased 12 for fiscal 2022 due primarily to higher revenues in Mens Unit sales of apparel increased 3 while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 9 percentage points of apparel revenue growth driven by higher fullprice ASP reflecting lower discounts as well as higher NIKE Direct and offprice ASPs Higher ASPs in part reflect inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory Reported EBIT increased 24 for fiscal 2022 as higher revenues and gross margin expansion more than offset higher selling and administrative expense Gross margin increased approximately 400 basis points primarily due to higher margins and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business higher fullprice ASP largely due to lower discounts favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates lower other costs as well as a higher mix of fullprice sales The decrease in other costs was primarily due to lower warehousing costs Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense Higher demand creation expense was primarily due to higher digital marketing investments to support heightened digital demand The increase in operating overhead expense was primarily due to an increase in NIKE Direct variable expenses as well as higher bad debt expense 2022 FORM 10K 40 Table

Interest and Taxes 2219 2261 2 1967 15 Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program The Corporate loss before interest and taxes primarily consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses including expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters unallocated insurance benefit and compensation programs including stockbased compensation and certain foreign currency gains and losses In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard rates used to record nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse related foreign currency hedge results conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021 Corporates loss before interest and taxes decreased 42 million during fiscal 2022 primarily due to the following a favorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of 219 million related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments reported as a component of consolidated Other income expense net an unfavorable change of 190 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse net of hedge gains and losses these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin and a favorable change of 13 million largely due to higher restructuringrelated costs associated with our organizational realignment in the prior year and to a lesser extent a net favorable impact related to our strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA in the current year partially offset by the onetime charge related to the deconsolidation of our Russian operations and higher administrative and wagerelated expenses in fiscal 2022 FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES OVERVIEW As a global company with significant operations outside the United States in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into US Dollars Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE Inc We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options As described below the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company NTC and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end 2022 FORM 10K 42 Table of Contents TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are Product Costs NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways 1 Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity a Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from thirdparty factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC b Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from thirdparty factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar In both purchasing scenarios a weaker US Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger US Dollar increases its cost 2 Factory input costs NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures Under this program our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a thirdparty All currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other income expense net Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating US Dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening US Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKEs US Dollar inventory cost Conversely a weakening US Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost NonFunctional Currency Denominated External Sales A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro eg the British Pound but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency These sales generate a foreign currency exposure Other Costs Nonfunctional currency denominated costs such as endorsement contracts also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent In certain cases the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other income expense net Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail NonFunctional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables including intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other income expense net within our consolidated results of operations MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above Generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements 2022 FORM 10K 43 Table of Contents Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments Accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other income expense net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the US Dollar Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into US Dollars for consolidated reporting The translation of foreign subsidiaries nonUS Dollar denominated balance sheets into US Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income loss within Shareholders equity In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income a weaker US Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger US Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately 295 million a benefit of approximately 893 million and a detriment of approximately 867 million for the years ended May 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately 87 million a benefit of approximately 260 million and a detriment of approximately 212 million for the years ended May 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively Management generally identifies hyperinflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a threeyear period exceeds 100 Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyperinflationary market As a result beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the US Dollar As of and for the period ended May 31 2022 this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into US Dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these US Dollar denominated investments at nonUS Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under US GAAP We utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these US Dollar investments The combination of the purchase and sale of the US Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold Hedges of the purchase of US Dollar denominated availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other income expense net had favorable impacts of approximately 132 million and 19 million and an unfavorable impact of approximately 91 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the US Dollar which could adversely impact the US Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings We have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with US GAAP There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31 2022 and 2021 There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31 2022 2021 and 2020 2022 FORM 10K 44 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW ACTIVITY Cash provided used by operations was an inflow of 5188 million for fiscal 2022 compared to 6657 million for fiscal 2021 Net income adjusted for noncash items generated 6848 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2022 compared to 6612 million for fiscal 2021 The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided used by operations of 1660 million for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 45 million for fiscal 2021 The net change in working capital was unfavorably impacted by a 2183 million increase in Inventories partially offset by a favorable impact from a 1102 million decrease in Accounts receivable These changes were in part due to supply chain constraints which caused higher levels of intransit inventory and therefore a lower supply of available inventory to meet consumer demand Cash provided used by investing activities was an outflow of 1524 million for fiscal 2022 compared to an outflow of 3800 million for fiscal 2021 primarily driven by the net change in shortterm investments During fiscal 2022 the net change in shortterm investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash outflow of 747 million compared to a cash outflow of 3276 million in fiscal 2021 Additionally during fiscal 2022 we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth specifically focused around digital capabilities our endtoend technology foundation our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain In future periods we expect to make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3 of annual revenues Cash provided used by financing activities was an outflow of 4836 million for fiscal 2022 compared to an outflow of 1459 million for fiscal 2021 This change was driven by our resumption of the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 resulting in 4014 million of share repurchases during fiscal 2022 compared to 608 million during fiscal 2021 In fiscal 2022 we purchased 273 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for 3994 million an average price of 14611 per share under the fouryear 15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018 As of May 31 2022 we had repurchased 774 million shares at a cost of 8663 million an average price of 11198 per share under this program In June 2022 the Board of Directors authorized a new fouryear 18 billion program to repurchase shares of the Companys Class B common stock The new program will replace the current 15 billion share repurchase program which will be terminated in fiscal 2023 Repurchases under the new program will be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b18 subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors The new share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and it may be suspended at any time at our discretion We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions CAPITAL RESOURCES On July 23 2019 we filed a shelf registration statement the Shelf with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time The Shelf expires on July 23 2022 and we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the SEC in July 2022 On March 11 2022 we

approval The facility matures on March 11 2027 with options to extend the maturity date up to an additional two years This facility replaces the prior 2 billion fiveyear credit facility agreement entered into on August 16 2019 which would have matured on August 16 2024 Refer to Note 7 ShortTerm Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information We currently have longterm debt ratings of AA and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services respectively As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on March 11 2022 if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fees and interest rates would increase Conversely if our longterm debt ratings were to improve the facility fees and interest rates would decrease Changes in our longterm debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities Under these facilities we have agreed to various covenants These covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and 2022 FORM 10K 45 Table of Contents payable As of May 31 2022 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future Liquidity is also provided by

paper outstanding We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs To date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets however future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets As of May 31 2022 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 130 billion primarily consisting of commercial paper corporate notes deposits held at major banks money market funds US government sponsored enterprise obligations US Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities Our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk While individual securities have varying durations as of May 31 2022 the weightedaverage days to maturity of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 113 days We believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future Our material cash requirements as of May 31 2022 were as follows Debt Obligations Refer to Note 7 ShortTerm Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 8 LongTerm Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information Operating Leases Refer to Note 19 Leases in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information Endorsement Contracts As of May 31 2022 we had endorsement contract obligations of 76 billion with 13 billion payable within 12 months representing approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete public figure sport team and league endorsers of our products Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than these amounts as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements andor royalties on product sales in future periods Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods In addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors and the contracts generally do not stipulate a minimum amount of cash to be spent on the product Product Purchase Obligations As of May 31 2022 we had product purchase obligations of 66 billion all of which are payable within the next 12 months Product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations In some cases prices are subject to change throughout the production process Other Purchase Obligations As of May 31 2022 we had 31 billion of other purchase obligations with 17 billion payable within the next 12 months Other purchase obligations primarily include technology investments construction service and marketing commitments including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts made in the ordinary course of business The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms and may include open purchase orders for nonproduct purchases In addition to the above we have longterm obligations for uncertain tax positions and various postretirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes and Note 13 Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and postretirement benefits respectively As a part of the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as of May 31 2022 we had 730 million in estimated future cash payments with 86 million payable within the next 12 months These amounts represent the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are reflected net of foreign tax credits we utilized Refer to Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 9 Income Taxes in our fiscal 2020 Form 10K which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 24

information related to our offbalance sheet arrangements bank guarantees and letters of credit OFFBALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor Currently we have several such agreements in place Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements We believe the assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting estimates described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Finance Committee of the Board of Directors These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements as of a given date Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting estimates Within the context of these critical accounting estimates we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized when transfer of control to the customer has occurred which is either upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the terms of sale The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns Provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date Estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded If actual or expected future returns discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made Refer also to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16 Revenues in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information INVENTORY RESERVES We make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 2022 FORM 10K 47 Table of Contents CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS A significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts In general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract However certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship We record Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year When we determine payments are probable the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance In these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which we record in Cost of sales as the related sales occur For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITELIVED ASSETS We review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss rather than Net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income In most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions By their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions When the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income loss to Other income expense net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs In rare circumstances the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence INCOME TAXES We are subject to taxation in the United States as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws On an interim basis we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate Income tax expense The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur As the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year When this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 2022 FORM 10K 48 Table of Contents We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary Realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain At least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made We historically had not provided for deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the US During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 in connection with a change in our legal entity structure that reduced the withholding tax consequences of a decision to remit undistributed earnings in the Netherlands we changed our assertion regarding our ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries We have evaluated our historic indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result of the legal entity restructuring and determined that any historical or future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested There is no deferred tax liability associated with those earnings On a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information OTHER CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability Refer to Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information 2022 FORM 10K 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions We have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries Where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements The timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31 2022 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for EuroUS Dollar British PoundEuro Chinese YuanUS Dollar and Japanese YenUS Dollar currency pairs Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs To achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT We monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and ValueatRisk VaR Our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies and fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only The VaR determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variancecovariance technique These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding oneyear period The value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors The estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the VaR model was 99 million and 92 million as of May 31 2022 and 2021 respectively The VaR increased yearoveryear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31 2022 Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 170 million and 184 million during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively 2022 FORM 10K 50 Table of Contents The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies and fixed interest rate US Dollar denominated debt Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation Furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the VaR calculation above Therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows Details of thirdparty debt are provided in the table below The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates EXPECTED MATURITY DATE YEAR ENDING MAY 31

of NIKE Inc and its subsidiaries the Company or NIKE All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated Economic sanctions imposed on Russia during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 impacted the Companys local business and a reduction in the Ruble liquidity affected the Companys ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk As a result the

fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues are recognized SALESRELATED RESERVES Consideration promised in the Companys contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets 2022 FORM 10K 62 Table of Contents The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns Provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date Estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers Actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded If actual or expected future returns discounts or claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves established a reduction or increase to net Revenues is recorded in the period in which such determination is made COST OF SALES Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs as well as warehousing costs including the cost of warehouse labor thirdparty royalties certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE Demand creation

retail brand presentation Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run Advertising media costs are expensed when the advertisement appears Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is complete and delivered A significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts In general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract However certain contracts contain elements that may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport eg winning a championship The Company records Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year When the Company determines payments are probable the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Companys best estimate of the endorsers performance In these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the Companys estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which the Company records in Cost of sales as the related sales occur For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense Through cooperative advertising programs the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products To the extent the Company receives a distinct good or service in exchange for

and 292 million respectively were recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applied OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE Operating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefitrelated expenses research and development costs bad debt expense as well as other administrative expenses such as rent depreciation and amortization professional services certain technology investments meetings and travel 2022 FORM 10K 63 Table of Contents CASH AND EQUIVALENTS Cash and equivalents represent cash and shortterm highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates with maturities three months or less at the date of purchase SHORTTERM INVESTMENTS Shortterm investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase At May 31 2022 and 2021 Shortterm investments consisted of availableforsale debt securities which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of tax in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss unless unrealized losses are determined to be unrecoverable Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification The Company considers all availableforsale debt securities including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within Shortterm investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys Shortterm investments ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Accounts receivable net consist primarily of amounts due from customers The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations the Company considers historical levels of credit losses as well as macroeconomic and industry trends to determine the amount of the allowance Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered noncurrent and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was 34 million and 93 million as of May 31 2022 and 2021 respectively INVENTORY VALUATION Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis In some instances the Company ships products directly from its suppliers to the customer with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Companys suppliers as well as inbound freight import duties taxes insurance logistics and other handling fees PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION Property plant and equipment are recorded at cost Depreciation is determined on a straightline basis for land improvements buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over 2 to 12 years on a straightline basis The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software The Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payrollrelated costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities training maintenance and all other postimplementation stage activities are expensed as incurred Development costs of computer software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers In most instances the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established therefore software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred 2022 FORM 10K 64 Table of Contents IMPAIRMENT OF LONGLIVED ASSETS The Company reviews the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others If such facts indicate a potential impairment the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value GOODWILL AND INDEFINITELIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment the Company allocates goodwill across its reporting units which are considered the Companys operating segments The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount an impairment test is unnecessary If an impairment test is necessary the Company will estimate the fair value of its related reporting units If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value Indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired If after assessing the totality of events and circumstances the Company determines it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets the Company primarily utilizes the relieffromroyalty method This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenues for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital If the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible exceeds its fair value the asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value OPERATING LEASES Beginning in fiscal 2020 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU No 201602 Leases Topic 842 The Companys lease recognition policies under Topic 842 are described in the following paragraphs The Company primarily leases retail store space certain distribution and warehouse facilities office space equipment and other nonreal estate assets The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at the commencement date which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the asset Lease components are not separated from nonlease components for real estate leases within the Companys lease portfolio Rightofuse ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term with lease expense recognized on a straightline basis The Companys incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable Lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses renewal or termination options rent holidays or certain landlord incentives including tenant improvement allowances ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced by the amount of lease incentives The lease term includes the noncancelable period of the lease and options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options The Company does not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes related lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straightline basis over the lease term Certain lease agreements include variable lease 2022 FORM 10K 65 Table of Contents payments which are based on a percent of retail sales over specified levels or adjust periodically for inflation as a result of changes in a published index primarily the Consumer Price Index and are expensed as incurred FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives equity securities and availableforsale debt securities Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date The Company uses a threelevel hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used as follows Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active Level 3 Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing Observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates forward pricing curves currency volatilities currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties The Companys fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded Refer to Note 6 Fair Value Measurements for additional information FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into US Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income loss in Total shareholders equity The Companys global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement the impact of which is recorded in Other income expense net within the Consolidated Statements of Income ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of Total shareholders equity Longterm debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and if designated the extent to which the hedge is effective The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For designated net investment hedges this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows For the Companys fair value hedges which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixedrate debt attributable to changes in interest rates the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Refer to Note 14 Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives 2022 FORM 10K 66 Table of Contents STOCKBASED COMPENSATION The Company accounts for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value net of estimated forfeitures of equity awards and recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense as applicable in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straightline basis over the vesting period Substantially all awards vest ratably over four years of continued employment with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant Performancebased restricted stock units vest based on the Companys achievement of certain performance criteria throughout the threeyear performance period and continued employment through the vesting date The fair value of options stock appreciation rights and employees purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans ESPPs is determined using the BlackScholes option pricing model The fair value of restricted stock and timevesting restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant The fair value of performancebased restricted stock units is estimated as of the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation Refer to Note 11 Common Stock and StockBased Compensation for additional information on the Companys stockbased compensation programs INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain At least quarterly the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies The Company uses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization which are inherently uncertain and can result in significant variation between estimated and actual results To the extent the Company believes that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset which increases the Companys income tax expense in the period when such determination is made The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes for further discussion EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards Refer to Note 12 Earnings Per Share for further discussion MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could differ from these estimates Additionally the extent to which the evolving COVID19 pandemic impacts the Companys financial statements will depend on a number of factors including the further spread and duration of COVID19 and the economic impacts of the pandemic There remains risk that COVID19 could have a material adverse impact on future revenue growth as well as overall profitability NOTE 2 INVENTORIES Inventory balances of 8420

This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions and assessing both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effectiveness of the hedging relationships The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31 2022 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for EuroUS Dollar British PoundEuro

longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period hedge accounting is discontinued and the Company accounts for the associated derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below Additionally the gains and losses associated with derivatives no longer designated as cash flow hedge instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss are recognized immediately in Other income expense net if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional twomonth period thereafter In rare circumstances the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company The purpose of the Companys foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Companys consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costs nonfunctional currency denominated revenues intercompany revenues demand creation expenses investments in US Dollar denominated availableforsale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions Product cost foreign currency exposures are primarily generated through nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below NIKE entities primarily purchase product in two ways 1 Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company NTC a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories predominantly in US Dollars The NTC whose functional currency is the US Dollar then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different 2022 FORM 10K 81 Table of Contents functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC 2 Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in US Dollars These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the US Dollar The Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to the Companys existing foreign currency exposures Under this program the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products factory input costs are denominated For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges For all currencies within the indices excluding the US Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below The Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed Typically the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was 185 billion as of May 31 2022 As of May 31 2022 approximately 607 million of deferred net gains net of tax on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature As of May 31 2022 the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the

nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings however this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted To manage this risk the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored The Companys derivative contracts contain credit riskrelated contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business The Companys bilateral creditrelated contingent features generally require the owing entity either the Company or the derivative counterparty to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of 50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than 50 million Additionally a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral requirements As of May 31 2022 the Company was in compliance with all credit riskrelated contingent features and no derivative instruments with such features were in a net liability position Accordingly the Company posted no cash collateral as a result of these contingent features Further as of May 31 2022 the Company had received 486 million in cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial For additional information related to the Companys

experience and the estimated probability of future loss the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations In the ordinary course of business the Company is subject to various legal proceedings claims and government investigations relating to its business products and actions of its employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability antitrust customs intellectual property and other matters The outcome of these legal matters is inherently

legal matters were to be resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above managements expectations the Companys financial position operating results and cash flows for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected In the opinion of management based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel the Company does not believe any currently

received claims for certain years from the Belgian Customs Authorities for alleged underpaid duties related to products imported beginning in fiscal 2018 The Company disputes these claims and plans to appeal At this time the Company is unable to estimate the range of loss and cannot predict the final outcome as it could take several years to reach a resolution on this matter If this matter is ultimately resolved against the Company the amounts owed including fines penalties and other consequences relating to the matter could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of
