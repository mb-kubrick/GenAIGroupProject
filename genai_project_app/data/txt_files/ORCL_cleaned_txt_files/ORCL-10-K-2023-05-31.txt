to as the Oracle Cloud The Oracle Cloud enables secure and isolated cloudbased instances for each of our customers to access the functionality of Oracle Cloud Services via a broad spectrum of devices Oracle Cloud Operations leverage automated software tools to enable the rapid delivery of the latest cloud technology capabilities to the Oracle Cloud as they become available providing Oracle customers access to the latest Oracle releases generally on a quarterly cadence We have invested in the expansion of the Oracle Cloud by increasing existing data center capacity and adding additional data centers in new geographic locations to meet current and expected customer demand We expect this trend will continue 11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Manufacturing We rely on thirdparty manufacturing partners to produce most of our hardware products that we market and sell to customers and utilize internally to deliver Oracle Cloud Services and we distribute most of our hardware products from these partners facilities Our manufacturing processes are substantially based on standardization of components across product types and centralization of assembly and distribution centers Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials supplies product subassemblies and full assemblies from a number of suppliers For most of our hardware products we have existing alternative sources of supply or such sources are readily available However we do rely on sole sources for certain hardware components We monitor and evaluate potential risks of disruption within our supply chain operations Refer to Risk Factors included in Item 1A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for our hardware products and the related risks to our businesses Sales and Marketing We directly market and sell our cloud license hardware support and services offerings globally to businesses of many sizes and in many industries government agencies and educational institutions We also market and sell our offerings globally through indirect channels In the United States US our sales and services employees are based throughout the country Outside the US our international subsidiaries sell support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not operate through a direct sales subsidiary Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global workforce provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geographyspecific economic trends and offers us an opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings Our international operations subject us to certain risks which are more fully described in Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this Annual Report A summary of our domestic and international revenues and longlived assets is set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report We also market our product offerings worldwide through indirect channels The companies that comprise our indirect channel network are members of the Oracle Partner Network The Oracle Partner Network is a global program that manages our business relationships with a large broadbased network of companies including cloud and license hardware and services suppliers system integrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon and in conjunction with our product offerings By offering our partners access to our product offerings educational information technical services marketing and sales support the Oracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in delivering solutions to customers globally Research and Development We develop the substantial majority of our products and services offerings internally utilizing the skills and diversity of a global workforce In addition we have extended our products and services offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products We have a number of US and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology However although we believe that our patents have value neither our business as a whole nor any of our principal businesses are materially dependent on a single patent Rapid technological advances in cloud software and hardware development evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions offerings and enhancements characterize the markets in which we compete We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current products and services offerings 12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Human Capital Resources At Oracle our success is driven by the quality of our people who we believe are among the best and

resources to help our employees explore build and achieve their career goals We promote regular career conversations between leaders and employees These are separate from performance feedback conversations and are focused on helping employees identify and take steps to grow their careers Our Talent Review process which runs on Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM provides the mechanism for leaders to review and discuss opportunities and action plans to develop employees 29 of our open nonentry level positions were filled internally in fiscal 2023 providing growth opportunities and retaining critical knowledge and talent We believe that helping our employees learn and apply new skills is key to retaining them and critical to our ability to innovate and rapidly evolve We support employees

thereof In fiscal 2023 81 of our employees participated in the annual survey Leaders listen to employees evaluate feedback and prioritize actions to enhance employee business and customer success Making a Difference Each year through our volunteering and giving programs Oracle employees donate tens of thousands of volunteer hours and millions of dollars matched by Oracle to a wide variety of causes Oracle and our employees also rise to the occasion in times of crisis During fiscal 2023 through employee donations and Oracles matching contributions we raised more than 1 million for disaster relief and recovery in response to earthquakes in Turkey hurricanes in the United States and other natural disasters Oracle also contributes tens of millions of dollars annually to protect the natural world and wildlife advance education and strengthen communities Among our recent commitments is a 1 million multiyear grant to The National Museum of African American History and Culture a Smithsonian

philanthropic education initiatives Oracle Academy and the Oracle Education Foundation help students develop the skills they need to become technology innovators and leaders Oracle also hosts Design Tech High School a public charter school at our Redwood Shores California campus 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Seasonality and Cyclicality Our quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans which are common in the IT industry In each fiscal year our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter See Cloud and License Business in Item 7 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the seasonality and cyclicality of the revenues expenses and margins of our cloud and license business which is our largest business Competition We face intense competition in all aspects of our business The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge expand or are acquired as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change Our customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation sourcing integration and ongoing maintenance of their IT environments Our enterprise cloud license and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world including Amazoncom Inc Microsoft Corporation International Business Machines Corporation Intel Corporation Cisco Systems Inc Adobe Systems Incorporated Alphabet Inc Salesforce Inc and SAP SE as well as other companies like HewlettPackard Enterprise and Workday Inc In addition due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions or offerings focused on a specific functionality product area or industry In addition as we expand into new market segments we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed For example following our acquisition of Cerner we also face competition from large healthcare IT providers such as Epic Systems Corporation Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc Arcadia Solutions athenahealth Inc and InterSystems Corporation among others Moreover we or our competitors may take certain strategic actionsincluding acquisitions partnerships and joint ventures or repositioning of product lineswhich invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories Key competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include total cost of ownership performance scalability reliability security functionality efficiency ease of use speed to production and quality of technical support Our products and services sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following among other factors market adoption of cloudbased IT offerings including SaaS and cloud infrastructure offerings the ease of deployment use transacting for and maintenance of our products and services offerings compatibility between Oracle products and services deployed within local IT environments and public cloud IT environments including our Oracle Cloud environments the adoption of commodity servers and microprocessors the broader platform competition between our industry standard Java technology platform and the NET programming environment of Microsoft operating system competition among our Oracle Solaris and Linux operating systems with alternatives including Microsofts Windows Server and other UNIX and Linux operating systems the adoption of open source alternatives to commercial software by enterprise software customers products features and functionality developed internally by customers and their IT staff 15 Table of

changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict The following discussion as well as our discussion in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations highlights some of these risks The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities Business and Operational Risks We may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products and services integrating acquired products and services and enhancing our existing products and services Rapid technological advances intense competition changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand customers may not purchase or subscribe to our license hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts Renewals of these contracts are important to our future success In addition we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services Machine learning and AI are increasingly driving innovations in technology but if they fail to operate as anticipated or our other products do not perform as promised our business and reputation may be harmed In addition our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames infrastructure costs to deliver new or enhanced products and services take longer or result in greater costs than anticipated we are unable to increase our existing data center capacity or establish data centers in new geographic locations in a timely manner to meet current or expected customer demand we fail to meet our contractual service level commitments there is a delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customers to new enhanced or acquired product lines or services sanctions export controls or other regulatory legislative or other barriers prevent us from serving certain customers or restrict our customers from operating in specific jurisdictions there are changes in IT trends that we do not adequately anticipate or timely address with our product development efforts we do not optimize complementary product lines and services in a timely manner or 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements we fail to adequately integrate support or enhance acquired product lines or services In addition our profitability and revenues could be adversely impacted if we lost one or more of our key customers for any reason including as a result of any of the factors discussed above Any such loss could also limit or reduce our growth in future periods If we do not successfully execute our Oracle Cloud strategy including our offerings of Oracle Cloud Services our revenues and profitability may decline We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via a variety of deployment models including via our cloudbased SaaS and OCI offerings As these business models continue to evolve we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline As customer demand for our cloud offerings increases we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and onpremise license and hardware product arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements Customers predominantly purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably or as services are consumed over the terms of the subscriptions Consequently any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations This is in contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products In addition we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transitions from or be able to sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for our license hardware and support offerings relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of and demand for our Oracle Cloud Services which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability As a part of our Oracle Cloud strategy we plan our investment levels based on estimates of future revenues and future anticipated rates of growth In recent periods our cloud services and license support expenses have grown to meet current and expected demand for our cloud offerings including investments to increase our existing data center capacity and to establish data centers in new geographic locations In connection with these investments we entered and expect to continue to enter into longterm operating lease commitments with third party data center providers that generally require us to pay significant contract termination fees to early exit such obligations should our strategies change which could adversely impact our profitability and cash flows In addition we outfit these data centers with equipment and improvements that we typically depreciate over their estimated useful lives which could be shortened should our cloud strategies change which could adversely affect our profitability Our products and services may not function properly if we experience significant coding manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud license and hardware offerings Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service our cloud license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding manufacturing or configuration errors that can impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequences The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly Errors in our cloud license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function integrate or operate with other cloud license or hardware offerings could result in service interruptions delays or outages of our cloud offerings could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services This includes thirdparty software products or services incorporated into our own If we experience any of these errors or if there are delays in releasing our cloud license or hardware offerings or new versions of these offerings our sales could be affected and revenues could decline In addition we run Oracles business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks Therefore any flaws could affect our and our customers abilities to conduct business operations and to ensure accuracy in financial processes and reporting and may result in unanticipated costs and interruptions Enterprise customers rely on our cloud license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud license and hardware offerings and related services 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements could expose us to product liability performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation which could impact our future sales If we are unable to compete effectively the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed We face intense competition in all aspects of our business The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge expand or are acquired as technology evolves and as delivery models change Our enterprise cloud license and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world In addition due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings We believe many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructure technologies including databases middleware products application development tools business applications collaboration products and business intelligence compute storage and networking products among others which compete with Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings In addition use of our competitors technologies can influence a customers purchasing decision or create an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize or migrate to Oracle products and services For example we offer our customers multicloud services whereby our customers can combine cloud services from multiple clouds with the goal of optimizing cost functionality and performance OCIs multicloud services work with a number of our competitors products including Microsoft Azure Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform This multicloud strategy could lead our customers to migrate away from our cloud offerings to our competitors products which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability Our competitors may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services on terms that we may not generally find acceptable which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products add new functionality acquire competitive products reduce prices better execute on their sales and marketing strategies offer more flexible business practices provide debt or equity financing to customers or form strategic alliances with other companies Mergers consolidations or alliances among our competitors or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may result in increased competition If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices introduce pricing models and offerings or offer other terms that are less favorable to us in order to compete successfully Any such changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely affect operating results Additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license hardware and services offerings and we may also incur increased cloud delivery expenses as we expand our cloud operations and update our infrastructure all of which could reduce our revenues and profitability Our license support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees respectively Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings Changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy commit to large customer deployments at prices that are unprofitable or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations These practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand our revenues could decrease The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models Any failure to offer highquality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure offerings We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate shortterm increases in customer demand for support services or may be inefficient in our resolution of customer support issues Increased customer demand for these services without corresponding revenues could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results Any failure to maintain highquality technical support or a market perception that we do not maintain highquality technical support could adversely affect our reputation 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements our ability to sell and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers and our business operating results and financial position Our cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity including the sourcing of technologies and components the results of these businesses will suffer We depend on suppliers to develop manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price quality technology availability or other business constraints Our supply chain operations could be disrupted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages natural disasters political unrest public health crises changes to trade laws or regulations port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped such as the tensions between China and Taiwan If one or more of the risks described above occurs our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected Supply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers In addition we have in some instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher purchases and balances of hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings relative to our historical positions While this permits us to secure manufacturing capacity it has increased excess and obsolescence risk of such hardware products and could adversely impact our profitability and cash flows We expect these factors will continue to impact us in the future We outsource a majority of our manufacturing assembly delivery and technology of and certain component designs for our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the US From time to time these partners experience production problems delays or cannot meet our demand for products Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies suppliers or locations Our periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive We are currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes product changes performance issues changes in strategies acquisitions and other internal and external considerations These types of restructurings have resulted and may in the future result in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities These types of restructurings may also lead to a shortage of sufficiently skilled employees in certain roles In addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these restructurings or may not do so within the expected timeframe These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected We may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees We rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management including our Chairman of the Board of Directors Chief Technology Officer and founder our Chief Executive Officer other members of our executive team and other key employees In the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel Hiring freezes or slowdowns may result in decreased productivity while existing employees take on additional roles and responsibilities and may also lead to a shortage of sufficiently skilled employees in certain roles We recently updated our onsite attendance expectations which may vary by line of business and location A transition away from our hybrid work model to onsite work requirements could result in employee dissatisfaction and attrition and could also lead to increased employee burnout or negatively impact employee productivity Many of our employees will continue to work from home some or all of the time While we believe this has helped us engage with a wider pool of talent and may help to retain employees who want or need more flexibility it may fail 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to yield these desired benefits and it may present cybersecurity risks and additional risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy Despite our efforts to reopen our offices in a safe manner our employees who have opted to return to the office may nevertheless be exposed to health risks which may expose us to potential liability We may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel With rare exceptions we do not have longterm employment or noncompetition agreements with our employees Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons and any future departures may be disruptive to our operations We continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs When we make adjustments to our workforce we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure We are experiencing increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which has affected our employee retention efforts and increased our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program In addition changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent Our general compensation program includes restricted stock units and performancebased equity which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry If our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stockbased compensation which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel There are risks associated with our cloud and license and hardware indirect sales channels which could affect our future operating results Our cloud and license and hardware indirect channel networks are comprised primarily of resellers system integratorsimplementers consultants education providers internet service providers network integrators and independent software vendors Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud software and hardware marketing and sales efforts Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated or our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or the level of demand for our channel participants products and services were to decrease There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants If we are not successful we may lose sales opportunities customers and revenues Acquisitions present many risks and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction We review and consider strategic acquisitions of companies products services and technologies We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions have been an important element of our overall corporate strategy Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include our ongoing business may be disrupted and our managements attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activities we may have difficulties 1 managing an acquired companys technologies or lines of business 2 entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions or 3 retaining key personnel from the acquired companies an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected we may impose our business practices or alter 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements gotomarket strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments each or all of which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by 1 claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition 2 preexisting contractual relationships that we assume from an acquired company the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business and 3 unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment as a result of an acquired companys business practices we may fail to identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company or technology we may not realize any anticipated increase in our revenues from an acquisition for a number of reasons including 1 if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to renew or terminate their contracts with the acquired company 2 if we are unable to sell the acquired products or service offerings to our customer base 3 if acquired customers do not elect to purchase our technologies due to differing business practices or 4 if contract models utilized by an acquired company do not allow us to recognize revenues in a manner that is consistent with our current accounting practices we may have difficulty integrating acquired technologies products services and their related supply chain operations with our existing lines of business and related infrastructures we may have multiple product lines or services offerings as a result of our acquisitions that are offered priced delivered and supported differently which could cause customer confusion and delays we may incur higher than anticipated costs 1 to support develop and deliver acquired products or services 2 for general and administrative functions that support new business models or 3 to comply with regulations applicable to an acquired business that are more complicated than we had anticipated we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from or may otherwise have certain limitations restrictions penalties or other sanctions imposed on us by worker councils or similar bodies under applicable employment laws as a result of an acquisition we may be unable to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis if at all and we may need to divest or dispose of assets or businesses or take other actions in order to obtain such approvals our use of cash to pay for acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash we incurred additional debt to finance our acquisition of Cerner in fiscal 2023 and in the future we may have to incur additional debt to pay for other acquisitions or have to delay or not proceed with an acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or on favorable terms and we may experience additional or unexpected changes in how we are required to account for our acquisitions pursuant to US generally accepted accounting principles including arrangements that we may assume in an acquisition The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions If we or our customers are unable to operate our respective businesses as a result of the COVID19 pandemic or any resurgence of the pandemic our future results of operations could be harmed The COVID19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have affected and any spread or resurgence of COVID19 variants may in the future affect how we and our customers partners and suppliers operate our businesses Our operations have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID19 pandemic that are not within our control including preventative measures and other related governmental measures If we are not able to respond to and manage future impacts of the COVID19 pandemic effectively our business will be harmed In addition the longterm impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the broader global economy and related impacts on our business and our customers business operations remains uncertain and cannot be predicted Additional impacts and risks that we are not currently aware of may arise and the COVID19 pandemic may also heighten other risks described in this Risk Factors section 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Data Privacy Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property Risks If our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result our data our customers data or our IT systems are accessed improperly made unavailable or improperly modified our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable our brand and reputation could be damaged the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using our products and services any of which could reduce our revenue and earnings increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions Our products and services including Oracle Cloud Services store retrieve manipulate and manage thirdparty data such as our customers information and data as well as our own data We believe that Oracle in particular is a target for computer hackers and other bad actors because Oracle stores and processes large amounts of data including in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences including patient health information financial services retail hospitality and the government We and our thirdparty vendors are regularly subject to attempts by third parties which may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations such as statesponsored organizations nationstates and individuals sponsored by them to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities penetrate or bypass our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers partners and suppliers software hardware and cloud offerings networks and systems Successful attempts by one of these malicious actors can lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers Attempts of this nature typically involve ITrelated viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack networks systems products and services exploit potential security vulnerabilities of networks systems products and services create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers partners employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data our customers suppliers or partners data or the IT systems of Oracle our customers suppliers or partners Our products and services including our Oracle Cloud Services may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer partner employee contractor or supplier error or malfeasance If a cyberattack or other security incident results in unauthorized access to or modification of our customers or suppliers data other external data our own data or our IT systems or if the services we provide to our customers are disrupted or if our products or services are reported to have or are perceived as having security vulnerabilities we could incur significant expenses and suffer substantial damage to our brand and reputation If our customers lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services including our cloud offerings and perceive them to not be secure they may decide to reduce or terminate their spend with us In addition cyberattacks and other security incidents could lead to considerable investigation and remediation costs loss or destruction of information interruption of our operations inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data lawsuits indemnity obligations regulatory investigations and financial penalties and claims and increased legal liability including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring Our remediation efforts may not be successful Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage IT systems change frequently grow more complex over time and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques Our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adopters of new technologies However our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge We may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on a wide variety of thirdparty products components and services If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components and if there is a security exploit targeting it we could face increased costs liability claims customer dissatisfaction reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies products services and technologies over the years While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation legal requirements or industry standards relating to privacy and data protection As regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify In addition US and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations in a manner that could significantly impact our ability as well as the ability of our customers partners and data providers to collect augment analyze use transfer including across national borders and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide Our acquisition of Cerner during fiscal 2023 also subjects us to additional data privacy and other related regulations governing the healthcare industry and patient information including but not limited to regulations governing electronic health data transmissions the processing of patient information healthcare fraud and healthcare information sharing Following the European Unions EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR the rate of global consideration and adoption of privacy laws has increased giving rise to more global jurisdictions in which regulatory inquiries and audits may be requested of Oracle and if we are not deemed to be in compliance could result in enforcement actions andor fines This is true in the US where for example California Colorado Connecticut Utah and Virginia have enacted privacy laws the US Congress is considering several privacy and securityrelated bills at the federal level the federal government is pursuing a range of cybersecurity initiatives pertaining to critical infrastructure companies and government contractors and a number of other state legislatures are considering privacy laws Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations The GDPR provides for monetary penalties of up to 4 of an organizations worldwide revenue These penalties can be significant For example multiple USbased technology companies have been fined between 225 million and 12 billion for alleged GDPR violations The US Federal Trade Commission continues to fine companies for unfair and deceptive data protection practices and these fines may increase in size Taken together the laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of data could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to data protection and our cost of providing our products and services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate Although we have implemented contracts diligence programs policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors partners suppliers data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts policies and procedures Additionally public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to provide certain products and services We make statements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy information provided on our website and press statements Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with these public statements or with US federal state or foreign laws and regulations including laws and regulations regulating privacy data security or consumer protection public perception standards selfregulatory requirements or legal obligations could result in lost or restricted business proceedings actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation Third parties have claimed and in the future may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights andor breach of license agreement provisions We periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them These third parties include entities that do not design manufacture or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property for the sole purpose of monetization through infringement assertions We expect to continue to receive such claims as we continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows the use and support of thirdparty code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the industry the volume of issued patents continues to increase and 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements nonpracticing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments Responding to any such claim regardless of its validity could be time consuming costly and result in litigation divert managements time and attention from developing our business require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products require us to release source code to third parties possibly under open source license terms require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers or otherwise adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights We rely on copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property Despite our efforts these protections may be limited Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or otherwise use our intellectual property Our patents may be invalidated or circumvented Any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the claim scope we seek if at all In addition the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of intellectual property protection as US laws and courts If we cannot protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive We may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years if at all Developing our various product offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from acquired companies Accelerated product and service introductions and short lifecycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position However we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all Legal and Regulatory Risks Adverse litigation results could affect our business We are subject to various legal proceedings Litigation can be lengthy expensive and disruptive to our operations and can divert our managements attention away from running our core business The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty Even a favorable judgment may be subject to appeals leading to protracted litigation additional costs and the prospect that our desired outcome will be overturned An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business operating results or financial condition Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report We may be subjected to increased taxes due to changes in US or international tax laws or from adverse resolutions of tax audits and controversies As a multinational corporation we incur income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use property and valueadded taxes in both the US and various foreign jurisdictions Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the application of the various taxes to the businesses in which we engage often requiring that we make judgments in determining our tax liabilities and worldwide provision for income taxes We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in the US and internationally which has led to disagreements regarding our treatment of various items including our intercompany transfer prices and calculations and the applicability of withholding taxes to our crossborder transactions Any unfavorable resolution of these tax audits and controversies could cause our tax liabilities to increase and may have a material and adverse impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate Although we believe that our income and nonincome based 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements tax estimates are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and tax accruals Countries around the world continually consider and make changes to relevant tax accounting and other laws treaties regulations guidance and interpretations In the US certain enacted and proposed legislation may substantially raise US income taxes on our domestic and international profits Such unfavorable tax legislation resulting from the shifting US political landscape and economic environment create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income taxes and could have a material adverse impact on our future income tax provisions and effective tax rate Other countries also continue to consider changes to their tax laws that could negatively affect us by increasing taxes imposed on our international revenue streams operations and crossborder transactions including the imposition of taxes targeted at digital technology businesses and changes in withholding tax rules The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD and the G20 have developed a twopillar framework that would provide greater taxing rights to market jurisdictions where customers or users are located and implement a 15 global minimum tax on multinational corporate groups On December 12 2022 the European Union member states agreed to implement the OECDs global corporate minimum tax rate of 15 Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECDs twopillar framework These changes may materially increase the level of income tax on our international profits Our future income tax provisions and effective tax rate could materially increase under the tax changes discussed above or if other changes are made to applicable tax laws and rules in the US or in other countries in which we do business Our provision for income taxes also could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of income earned or losses incurred in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates fluctuations in our stock price and level of stockbased compensation expense changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and by other factors Our international sales and operations and global customer base subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from and have significant operations outside of the US and in both our US and nonUS operations we serve customers based in or with ties to numerous jurisdictions around the world Compliance with international and US laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws foreign currencyrelated regulations competitionantitrust regulations antibribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA market access regulations tariffs and import export and general trade regulations including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos Violations of these laws and regulations could result in monetary fines civil andor criminal penalties enforcement actions against us our officers or our employees and prohibitions on the conduct of our business including disgorgement the loss of trade privileges and other remedial measures Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries or territories or to certain entities could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results Changes to sanctions or export control regulations in the US and the other jurisdictions where we currently operate or have dealings or in the future may operate or have dealings can require suspension or termination of business including financial transactions in certain countries territories or with certain customers and any such action in the future could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations For example in March 2022 following Russias invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of economic sanctions and export controls targeting Russia by the US EU and other countries we withdrew our operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus We continue to monitor relations between the US and the Russian Federation the Republic of Belarus and the Peoples Republic of China among others It is difficult to anticipate the effect such relations may have on us Compliance with any further economic sanctions export controls or other regulatory restrictions and any retaliatory responses thereto taken by the US or other countries could prevent us from serving certain customers or restrict our customers from operating in specific jurisdictions which could have an adverse effect on our operations and results of operations Compliance with these laws may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded Where circumstances warrant we provide information and report our findings to government authorities and in some circumstances such authorities conduct their own investigations and we respond to their requests or demands for information No assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove effective We are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally including those related to general economic conditions in each country or region political unrest terrorism and war including but not limited to the current RussiaUkraine war the economic impact thereof and the potential to subject our business to materially adverse consequences should the situation escalate beyond its current scope including among other potential impacts the geographic proximity of the situation relative to the rest of Europe where a material portion of our business is carried out the potential for other hostilities including but not limited to escalating tensions between China and Taiwan public health risks social risks and supporting infrastructure stability risks particularly in areas in which we have significant operations fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related impacts on customer demand and our operating results difficulties in accessing or transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries that could lead to a devaluation of our net assets in particular our cash assets in that countrys currency regulatory changes including government austerity measures in certain countries that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposits or other cash assets that we hold in these countries or that impose additional taxes that we may be required to pay in these countries common local business behaviors or regulatory requirements that conflict with our business ethics practices and conduct policies longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable overlapping tax regimes and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries The variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our supply chain operations and sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions As the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited a publicly traded company in India and Oracle Corporation Japan a publicly traded company in Japan we face several additional risks including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if these entities were whollyowned subsidiaries Our sales to local state federal and foreign government customers expose us to business volatility and risks including government budgeting cycles and appropriations procurement regulations governmental policy shifts early termination of contracts audits investigations sanctions and penalties We derive revenues from contracts with the US government state and local governments and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws relating to the award administration and performance of those contracts Governmental entities are variously pursuing policies that affect our ability to sell our products and services Changes in government procurement policy priorities regulations technology initiatives andor requirements may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector For example the US government imposes evolving cybersecurity requirements including for example the FedRAMP authorization process and the Department of Defense DoD Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification These requirements may impact our lines of business in the US federal government market Compliance with these cybersecurity requirements is complex and costly and failure to meet or delays in meeting the required security controls could limit our ability to sell 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements products and services directly or indirectly to the DoD and other federal and state government entities that implement similar cybersecurity requirements We are also subject to early termination of our contracts Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time for a variety of reasons including without cause For example the US federal government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts at its convenience or for default based on our performance US federal state and local government and foreign government contracts are generally subject to government funding authorizationsappropriations Contracts may also be terminated due to a lack of government funds There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending as governments continue to face significant deficit reduction pressures This may adversely impact spending on government programs Government contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations If violations of law are found they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business Environmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs Our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state federal and international laws governing protection of the environment proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products human health and safety the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers as well as local testing and labeling requirements Compliance with these everchanging environmental and other laws in a timely manner could increase our product design development procurement manufacturing delivery cloud operations and administration costs limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete noncompliant inventory change our sales activities or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability including fines penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses Regulatory market and competitive pressures regarding the greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations may also grow A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales Environmental legislation such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances RoHS the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive WEEE Directive and Chinas regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products among others may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements We have an Environmental Steering Committee ESC comprised of senior individuals from a wide range of Oracle business units including our Chief Sustainability Officer who oversees our overall sustainability strategy including climate related risk mitigation The ESC evaluates if climate or environmental risks have the potential for significant chronic or acute impact on our core andor strategic business functions including service delivery and support product development and deployment supply chain management facility operations employee recruitment and retention or brand reputation A failure by the ESC to identify and assess these risks could adversely affect our reputation business financial performance and growth We publish an annual Social Impact Report which includes disclosure of our Environmental Social and Governance ESG matters and goals Our disclosures on these matters and standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these standards may potentially harm our reputation and brand By electing to set and share publicly these corporate ESG standards our business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG activities Further new laws regulations policies and international accords relating to ESG matters including sustainability climate change human capital and diversity are being developed and formalized in the US Europe and elsewhere which may require specific targetdriven frameworks or disclosure requirements For example in the US the SEC has proposed rules requiring among other things disclosure of public companies climaterelated strategies costs 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements impacts and targets Standards for reporting ESG metrics including ESGrelated disclosures that may be required by the SEC or other regulators are complex and evolving and the implementation and oversight of controls to comply with applicable reporting and disclosure standards could impose significant compliance costs In addition such disclosure requirements could result in revisions to our previous ESGrelated disclosure or challenges in meeting evolving and varied regulatory and other stakeholder expectations and standards which could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and prospects Financial Risks Our operations can be difficult for us to predict because our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on a number of factors Our revenues particularly certain of our cloud license and onpremise license revenues and hardware revenues can be difficult to forecast A substantial portion of our cloud license onpremise license and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability The number of large license transactions and to a lesser extent hardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions In addition sudden shifts in regional or global economic or political activity may cause our sales forecasts to be inaccurate In addition we hold a portfolio of publicly traded and privately held equity investments Changes in the fair values of these investments are recorded as unrealized gains or losses as a component of consolidated net income in each period The timing and amount of changes in fair value if any of these investments depends on factors beyond our control including the perceived and actual performance of the companies or funds in which we invest Changes in the fair values of these investments are also subject to the general conditions of public and private equity markets which are uncertain and have in the past varied and may in the future vary materially by period Changes in the fair values of these investments have contributed and may in the future contribute to volatility in our net income that is not reflective of our core businesses Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability We conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the US Dollar Changes in the values of major foreign currencies particularly the Australian Dollar British Pound Brazilian Real Canadian Dollar Euro Indian Rupee Japanese Yen and Saudi Riyal relative to the US Dollar can significantly affect our total assets revenues operating results and cash flows which are reported in US Dollars Fluctuations in foreign currency rates including the strengthening of the US Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in US Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into US Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currencybased enterprises to purchase In addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the US Generally our reported revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens In addition our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits among other assets are held in foreign currencies and reported in US Dollars In addition we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term which are charged to earnings in the period incurred We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures We may suspend the program from time to time As part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses A large portion of our consolidated operations are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts including the cost to obtain such contracts For example we will experience 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or costeffective to hedge our foreign currency exposures if our hedging efforts are ineffective or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency exposures that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and any related fees paid to purchase such contracts and other factors All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows We have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the US Dollar We could incur future losses in emerging market countries and other countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationary There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness As of May 31 2023 we had an aggregate of 905 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2023 and calendar year 2061 Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this Risk Factors section There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully We may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt Furthermore if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase Should we incur future increases in interest expense our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our US federal income tax could be limited which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate In addition changes to our outlook or credit rating or a withdrawal by any rating agency could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value All of the factors discussed within this Risk Factors section could affect our stock price The timing of announcements in the public market by us or by our competitors regarding new cloud services products product enhancements technological advances acquisitions or major transactions could also affect our stock price Changes in the amounts and frequency of stock repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price Our stock price could also be affected by factors some of which are beyond our control including among others speculation in the press social media and the analyst community changes in recommendations or earnings related estimates by financial analysts changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock negative analyst surveys or channel check surveys earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors expectations our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance The stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources which could adversely affect our business We cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares Further our stock repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time However we do not expect to increase the amount of stock repurchases until our gross debt is reduced below certain thresholds Even if fully implemented our stock repurchase program may not enhance longterm stockholder value In addition the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law on August 16 2022 imposes an excise tax of 1 potentially increasing to 4 under certain US tax proposals on certain corporate stock repurchases 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements General Risks Economic political and market conditions can adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting These include general economic and business conditions overall demand for enterprise cloud license and hardware products and services governmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities and general legal regulatory and political developments Macroeconomic developments such as the global or regional economic effects resulting from increasing inflation rates limited liquidity adverse developments affecting financial institutions the current RussiaUkraine war and related economic curtailment initiatives evolving trade policies between the US and international trade partners or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic political or market conditions could negatively affect our business operating results financial condition and outlook which in turn could adversely affect our stock price Any general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending which could cause customers to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services If any parties with whom we conduct business or invest our cash or cash equivalents are unable to meet their obligations to us our business could be adversely affected Bank failures or issues in the broader US or global financial systems may have an impact on the broader capital markets and in turn our ability to access those markets In addition international regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and onpremise license hardware and related services and to a lesser extent also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our subscriptionbased cloud offerings Business disruptions could adversely affect our operating results A significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the US We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems supply chains and processes could cause delays in completing sales providing services including some of our cloud offerings and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing backoffice processes A major natural disaster political social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change such as increased storm severity drought and pandemics that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations supply chains or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected Item 1B Unresolve d Staff Comments None 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 2 P roperties Our properties consist of owned and leased office facilities for sales support

Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended May 31 2022 as filed with the SEC on June 21 2022 which is available free of charge on the SECs website at wwwsecgov and on our Investor Relations website at wwworaclecominvestor Business Overview Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology IT environments Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models These models include onpremise cloudbased and hybrid deployments an approach that combines both onpremise and cloudbased deployments Accordingly we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers needs Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes government agencies educational institutions and resellers We have three businesses cloud and license hardware and services each of which comprises a single operating segment The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Item 1 Business and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers CODMs which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer view our operating results and allocate resources Cloud and License Business Our cloud and license business which represented 83 and 85 of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022 respectively markets sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are Cloud services and license support revenues which include o license support revenues which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure licenses for use in cloud onpremise and other IT environments Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements which current license support customers are entitled to receive License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license andor onpremise license are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed are generally renewed at the customers option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided which is generally one year and o cloud services revenues which are earned by providing customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloudbased deployment models that Oracle develops provides unspecified updates and enhancements for deploys hosts manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period Oracle Cloud Services arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed generally have durations of one to three years are generally renewed at the customers option and are generally 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or in the case of usage model contracts as the cloud services are consumed over time Cloud license and onpremise license revenues which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications Oracle Database Oracle Middleware and Java among others which our customers deploy within cloudbased onpremise or other IT environments Our cloud license and onpremise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use Revenues from usagebased royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and onpremise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the pointintime nature of revenue recognition for license transactions which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms Cloud license and onpremise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts as further described above Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy In recent periods customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased To address customer demand and enable customer choice we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads The proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue Cloud services revenues represented 32 25 and 22 of our total revenues during fiscal 2023 2022 and 2021 respectively Our cloud and license business revenue growth is affected by many factors including the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings customer satisfaction with our offerings the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses the pricing amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand and foreign currency rate fluctuations On a constant currency basis we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings and continued demand for our cloud license and onpremise license offerings We believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business total revenues which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop improve increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services Our cloud and license business margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner and the historical 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements upward trend of our cloud license and onpremise license revenues which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery in each case over those four fiscal quarterly periods Hardware Business Our hardware business which represented 6 and 7 of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022 respectively provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardwarerelated software products including Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage industryspecific hardware offerings operating systems virtualization management and other hardwarerelated software and related hardware support Each hardware product and its related software such as an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels including independent distributors and valueadded resellers Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services including direct materials and labor costs Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict Our hardware revenues cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors including our manufacturing partners abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions with this factor becoming more pronounced in recent periods due to global supply chain constraints for certain technology components our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings customer demand for competing offerings including cloud infrastructure offerings the strength of general economic and business conditions governmental budgetary constraints whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products which have a finite life and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available and foreign currency rate fluctuations Services Business Our services business which represented 11 and 8 of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022 respectively helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies extensive experience broad sets of intellectual property and best practices Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for and the competitive position of our services customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the related services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings general economic conditions governmental budgetary constraints personnel reductions in our customers IT departments tighter controls over customer discretionary spending and foreign currency rate fluctuations 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Acquisitions Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy Historically we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies products services and technologies We acquired certain companies and technologies during fiscal 2023 and 2022 including Cerner in fiscal 2023 Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our acquisition of Cerner and our other recent acquisitions As compelling opportunities become available we may acquire companies products services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings operating margin cash flows and return on invested capital targets among others before deciding to move forward with an acquisition Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Accounting Standards Codification ASC and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC GAAP as set forth within the ASC requires us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent that there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our financial statements will be affected The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include Revenue Recognition Business Combinations Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments Accounting for Income Taxes and Legal and Other Contingencies Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more discussion of our critical and other accounting policies There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the prior year Revenue Recognition The most critical judgments required in applying ASC 606 Revenue Recognition from Customers and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price SSP for each performance obligation Many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct Oracle products and services generally function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency Therefore multiple products and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes We allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative SSP the determination of SSP is discussed below for each 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements performance obligation within each contract We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied We use historical sales transaction data and judgment among other factors in determining the SSP for products and services For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and onpremise licenses we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition changes in demand for our products and services and economic factors among others Our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts that is the selling price is highly variable and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence As a result the SSP for a cloud license and an onpremise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and onpremise license revenues Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 in accounting for our acquisitions ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets or to an acquisition of a business A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of a business acquisitions measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets preacquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration where applicable Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results For a given business acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a nonincome tax related preacquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination whichever comes first changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Goodwill and Intangible AssetsImpairment Assessments We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business and other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerations macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions These estimates and assumptions include among others revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist In such situations we are required to evaluate whether the net book values of our finite lived intangible assets are recoverable We determine whether finite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and include among others forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts Accounting for Income Taxes Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision In the ordinary course of a global business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located We consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior years if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the need for a valuation allowance In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known which can materially impact our effective tax rate The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities which often result in proposed assessments Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740 Income Taxes which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit judicial rulings and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under Business Combinations above For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable Because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made As additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations Impact of Acquisitions The comparability of our operating results for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was impacted by our recent acquisitions including Cerner In our discussion of changes in our results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 we have qualitatively disclosed the impact of our acquired products and services subsequent to the acquisition date to the growth in operating segments revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations When material we have also provided quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services The impacts of expense contributions from our recent acquisitions subsequent to the acquisition dates generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations andor were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information In our results of operations discussion below we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin all of which are presented on a GAAP basis We also present a GAAPbased discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses In addition we discuss below the results of each of our three businessescloud and license hardware and serviceswhich are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280 Segment Reporting The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below Consistent with our internal management reporting processes research and development expenses general and administrative expenses stockbased compensation expenses amortization of intangible assets certain other expense allocations acquisition related and other expenses restructuring expenses interest expense nonoperating expenses net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items andor it is impracticable to do so Refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2023 and 2022 During fiscal 2022 we remitted and recorded 47 billion for certain litigation related items that we do not expect to recur in future periods Constant Currency Presentation Our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses revenues and expenses As a result each of our businesses revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the US Dollar against major international currencies In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure To present this information current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US Dollars are converted into US Dollars at constant exchange rates ie the rates in effect on May 31 2022 which was the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods For example if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 10 million Euros from products sold on May 31 2023 and 2022 our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of 108 million in fiscal 2023 using 108 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period and 107 million in fiscal 2022 using 107 as the monthend average exchange rate for the period 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The constant currency presentation however would translate the fiscal 2023 results using the fiscal 2022 exchange rate and indicate in this example no change in revenues during the period In each of the tables below we present the percent change based on actual unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency Total Revenues and Operating Expenses Year Ended May 31 Percent Change Dollars in

Middle East and Africa Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations our total revenues increased across our three businesses during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 primarily due to revenue contributions from our acquisition of Cerner Excluding the impact of our acquisition of Cerner the constant currency revenues increase during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 in our cloud and license business was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and also renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support services partially offset by a decrease in our cloud license and onpremise license revenues In our hardware business the increase during fiscal 2023 was primarily due to growth in our Oracle Exadata and certain other strategic hardware product offerings In our services business the increase during fiscal 2023 was attributable to an increase in revenues for each of our primary services offerings In reported currency Cerner contributed 59 billion to our total revenues during fiscal 2023 In constant currency the Americas the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 84 10 and 6 respectively of the constant currency total revenue growth during fiscal 2023 Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations our total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 primarily due to additional operating expenses as a result of our acquisition of Cerner including higher intangible assets amortization higher cloud services and license support expenses which were primarily due to higher employee related expenses and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business revenues higher hardware expenses which were primarily due to incremental hardware product costs related to Cerners hardware business higher restructuring expenses and higher expenses across other operating expense categories primarily due to higher employee related expenses Furthermore during fiscal 2022 we recorded gains of 250 million on operating asset sales which was allocated as a benefit to most of our operating expense lines as presented per our consolidated statement of operations and which reduced our total operating expenses during the same period These constant currency expense increases during fiscal 2023 were 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements partially offset by the absence of 47 billion of litigation related charges that were recorded to acquisition related and other expenses during fiscal 2022 We do not expect the litigation related charges to recur in future periods In constant currency our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2023

purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term which is generally one year Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloudbased deployment models that we develop provide unspecified updates and enhancements for deploy host manage and support Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term which is generally one to three years or in the case of usage model contracts as the cloud services are consumed Cloud license and

Americas the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 84 9 and 7 respectively of the constant currency revenue growth for this business during fiscal 2023 In constant currency our total cloud and

Oracle Engineered Systems server storage and industryspecific hardware offerings The hardware product and related software such as an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term which is generally one year The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and valueadded resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by thirdparty manufacturers warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete the cost of materials used to repair customer products with eligible support contracts the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services and sales and marketing expenses which are largely personnel

Actual Constant 2022 Interest expense 3505 27 27 2755 Interest expense increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher average borrowings during fiscal 2023 resulting from

securities consist of time deposits marketable equity securities and certain other securities The decrease in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31 2023 in comparison to May 31

senior notes due October 2022 and February 2023 repurchases of our common stock payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures These cash outflows during fiscal

terms which are generally one year in length Over the course of a fiscal year we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses cloud services hardware offerings and other services Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are typically for employee related expenditures material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products taxes interest payments and leased facilities Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher net income that was primarily due to the

discontinued at any time Contractual Obligations Our largest contractual obligations as of May 31 2023 consisted of principal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments routine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that are included in our consolidated balance sheet operating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding In addition as of May 31 2023 we had 94 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits including related interest and penalties recorded on our consolidated balance sheet the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2024 We are involved in claims and legal proceedings which are inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period are inherently unpredictable and many aspects are out of our control Notes 2 7 13 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report include additional information regarding our most material contractual obligations and contingencies We believe that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances cash generated from operations and our 60 billion fiveyear revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements In addition we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash generated from operations additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities StockBased Awards Our stockbased compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders We recognize that stockbased awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stockbased awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages Consistent with these dual goals our cumulative potential dilution since June 1 2020 has been an annualized rate of 18 per year The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stockbased awards granted and assumed net of stockbased awards forfeited by employees leaving the company divided by the weightedaverage outstanding shares during the calculation period This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stockbased awards vest and if applicable are exercised Of the outstanding stock options at May 31 2023 which generally have a tenyear exercise period all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date In recent years our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stockbased compensation program However we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions to pay dividends to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes As of May 31 2023 the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding stockbased awards regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested was 80 During fiscal 2023 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organizationwide stockbased award grants to selected employees all stockbased award grants to senior officers and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62500 or greater Each member of a separate executive officer committee referred to as the Plan Committee was allocated a fiscal 2023 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee Stockbased awards activity from June 1 2020 through May 31 2023 is summarized as follows shares in millions Stockbased awards outstanding at May 31 2020 277 Stockbased awards granted and assumed 200 Stockbased awards vested and issued and if applicable exercised 212 Forfeitures cancellations and other net 49 Stockbased awards outstanding at May 31 2023 216 Annualized

recent accounting pronouncements if any and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements if any see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk Equity Price Risk Marketable and NonMarketable Equity Investments Our marketable and nonmarketable equity securities investments totaled 972 million and 11 billion as of May 31 2023 and 2022 respectively Our marketable equity securities investments in publicly traded companies are recorded at fair value which is subject to market price volatility Our nonmarketable equity securities investments in private companies not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairment Our nonmarketable equity securities investments accounted for under the equity method primarily in a related party entity generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes However these equity method investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover The timing and amounts of changes in fair value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity investments depends on factors beyond our control including the perceived and actual performance of the companies in which we invest Our nonmarketable convertible debt investments would be subject to equity price risk in the future when the convertible option is exercised For additional disclosure regarding the impact to our quarterly results of operations from investment volatility please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report Currency Risk Foreign Currency Translation Risk As described under Constant Currency Presentation above our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and expenses that we report in US Dollars As a result our consolidated revenues and expenses are affected and will continue to be affected by changes in the US Dollar against major foreign currencies Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets liabilities earnings and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into US Dollars for and as of the end of each reporting period In particular the strengthening of the US Dollar generally will reduce the reported amount of our foreigndenominated cash cash equivalents trade receivables total revenues and total expenses that we translate into US Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for and as of the end of each reporting period Foreign Currency Transaction Risk We transact business in various foreign currencies Our foreign currency exposures primarily arise from various intercompany transactions Our principal currency exposures include the Australian Dollar Brazilian Real Euro Japanese Yen and Saudi Riyal We have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks that arise from the aforementioned transactions Under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts for major currencies in which we have an exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions We may suspend this program from time to time Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally shortterm in duration and we do not use them for trading purposes Realized gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts and also costs incurred to enter into these foreign currency forward contracts are included in nonoperating expenses or income net in our consolidated financial statements Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of crosscurrency transactions that we enter into the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors Furthermore as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future in which the amounts and timing are unknown Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our foreign currency forward contracts 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Sensitivity Analysis The following table sets forth the hypothetical potential

of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10K we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a15e and 15d15e Based on our managements evaluation with the participation of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report our Principal Executive and Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our management including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a15f and 15d15f Under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2023 based on the guidelines established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commissions 2013 framework Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with US GAAP Based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31 2023 We reviewed the results of managements assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31 2023 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in Part IV Item 15 of this Annual Report Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As a result of our acquisition of Cerner on June 8 2022 our internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of acquisition includes certain additional internal controls relating to Cerner Except as described above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of Exchange Act Rules 13a15 or 15d15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level However our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud A control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met Further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake Additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate Because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected Item 9B Othe r

misstatement of the financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks Such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall

benefits related to various domestic and foreign matters As of May 31 2023 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was 77 billion of which 39 billion if recognized would impact the Companys effective tax rate The Company uses significant judgment in the accounting for some of these uncertain tax positions including the interpretation and application of tax laws and legal rulings in various jurisdictions Auditing managements evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions was complex involved significant judgment and was based on interpretations and application of tax laws and legal rulings 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements How we addressed the matter in our audit We obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over managements process for interpretation and application of tax laws and legal rulings as well as development of the assumptions and estimates used in the measurement of uncertain tax positions To test managements assessment of which uncertain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained we performed audit procedures that included among others evaluating managements assumptions and analysis including any communications with taxing authorities that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions We involved our tax subject matter professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities In addition we also evaluated the Companys disclosures in relation to these matters included in Note 13 of the financial statements Business combinations Valuation of intangible assets Description of the matter As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements the Company completed the acquisition of Cerner Corporation during fiscal year 2023 for a total purchase price of 282 billion which was accounted for as a business combination In connection with this acquisition management recognized customer relationship order backlog developed technology and trade name intangible assets of 120 billion The valuation of the customer relationship and developed technology intangible assets is complex and judgmental due to the use of subjective assumptions in the valuation models used by management when determining their estimated fair value In particular the fair value estimates for the acquired assets are sensitive to changes in assumptions for revenue growth and cost of revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue Auditing managements valuation of customer relationship and developed technology intangible assets is complex due to the auditor judgment required to evaluate managements assumptions used in determining the fair value of these assets How we addressed the matter in our audit We obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the determination of the fair value of customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets This included controls over managements development of the assumptions described above To test the estimated fair value of the customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets we performed audit procedures that included among others evaluating the Companys selection of valuation methodologies with the assistance of our valuation specialists and application of acquisition accounting and evaluating the significant assumptions used by the Company to develop the forecasted revenue growth rates and projected cost of revenues and operating expenses We compared the significant assumptions to current industry market and economic trends and to the historical results of the acquired business and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management in the valuation s Ernst Young LLP We have served as the Companys auditor since 2002 San Jose California June 20 2023 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Report of Independent Registered

SIGNI FICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Oracle Corporation provides products and services that substantially address all aspects of enterprise information technology IT environments including applications and infrastructure technologies We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models These models include onpremise cloudbased and hybrid deployments an approach that combines both onpremise and cloud based deployments Oracle Cloud SoftwareasaService and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SaaS and OCI respectively and collectively Oracle Cloud Services offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services delivered via various cloud delivery models enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloudbased or onpremise IT environments Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support contracts which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies Oracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977 Basis of Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracles stockholders for all periods presented The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of nonoperating expenses or income net in our consolidated statements of operations Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated On June 8 2022 we completed our acquisition of Cerner Corporation Cerner a provider of digital information systems used within hospitals and health systems by means of a merger of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries with and into Cerner such that Cerner became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Oracle Through our acquisition of Cerner we enhanced our offerings of each of our three existing businesses cloud and license hardware and services The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report include the financial results of Cerner prospectively from the date of acquisition Refer to Note 2 below for additional details regarding our acquisition of Cerner The comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31 2022 was impacted by 47 billion of certain litigation related charges during fiscal 2022 The comparability of our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended May 31 2021 was impacted by a 23 billion net income tax benefit related to the partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intragroup transfer of certain intellectual property rights Refer to Note 13 below for additional information regarding our income taxes 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates judgments and assumptions We believe that the estimates judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates judgments and assumptions are made These estimates judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented To the extent that there are differences between these estimates judgments or assumptions and actual results our consolidated financial statements will be affected In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require managements judgment in its application There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result During the first quarter of fiscal 2023 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and increased the estimate of the useful lives from four years to five years effective at the beginning of fiscal 2023 Based on the carrying value of our servers as of May 31 2022 this change in accounting estimate decreased our total operating expenses by 434 million during fiscal 2023 Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenues include cloud and license revenues which include the sale of cloud services and license support and cloud licenses and onpremise licenses which typically represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both cloud and onpremise IT environments hardware revenues which include the sale of hardware products including Oracle Engineered Systems servers and storage products and industryspecific hardware and hardware support revenues and services revenues which are earned from providing cloud license and hardwarerelated services including consulting and advanced customer services License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and onpremise licenses purchased by our customers at their option License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and onpremise license fees Substantially all of our customers elect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually Cloud services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud Services offerings which deliver applications and infrastructure technologies via cloudbased deployment models that we develop functionality for provide unspecified updates and enhancements for deploy host manage upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period Cloud license and onpremise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database middleware application and industryspecific software products which our customers use for cloudbased onpremise and other IT environments The vast majority of our cloud license and onpremise license arrangements include license support contracts which are entered into at the customers option Revenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems computer servers storage and industryspecific hardware Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs maintenance services and 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements technical support services Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees Our services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to among others deploy architect integrate upgrade and secure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies Our advanced customer services are designed to provide supplemental support services performance services and higher availability for Oracle products and services We apply the provisions of ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 as a single standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of our cloud license hardware and services arrangements and generally require revenues to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services provided to our customers reflecting the amount of consideration we expect to receive for those goods or services Pursuant to ASC 606 revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps identification of the contract or contracts with a customer identification of the performance obligations in the contract determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract and recognition of revenues when or as the contractual performance obligations are satisfied Our customers that contract with us for the provision of cloud services software hardware or other services include businesses of many sizes government agencies educational institutions and our channel partners which include resellers and system integrators The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers We record an unbilled receivable which is included within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets when revenues are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary Invoices for cloud license and onpremise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance Cloud SaaS and cloud infrastructure contracts are generally invoiced annually quarterly or monthly in advance Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division The transaction price for a contract that is financed through our Oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of nonoperating expenses or income net within our consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed Our revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant Our arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities Revenue Recognition for Cloud Services Revenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the cloud services are delivered beginning on the date our service is made available to a customer We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period Revenues from cloud services that are provided on a consumption basis such as metered services are generally recognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support Oracles primary performance obligations with respect to license support contracts and hardware support contracts are to provide customers with technical support as needed and unspecified software product upgrades maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period if and when they are available and hardware product repairs as applicable Oracle is obligated to make the license and hardware support services available continuously throughout the contract period Therefore revenues for license support contracts and hardware support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods that the support services are provided Revenue Recognition for Cloud Licenses and OnPremise Licenses Revenues from distinct cloud license and onpremise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use Revenues from usagebased royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and onpremise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs For usagebased royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer Revenue Recognition for Hardware Products The hardware product and related software such as an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer Revenue Recognition for Services Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed Revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion Revenues for consumptionbased services are generally recognized as the services are performed Allocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency therefore our products and services are generally not combined We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price SSP for each performance obligation within each contract We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and onpremise licenses we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change Our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and onpremise license purchase License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and onpremise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts that is the selling price is highly variable and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence As a result the SSP for a cloud license and an onpremise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and onpremise license revenues 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Remaining Performance Obligations from Customer Contracts Trade receivables net of allowance for credit losses and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31 2023 and 2022 The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31 2023 and 2022 that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31 2022 and 2021 respectively was approximately 83 billion and 88 billion Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31 2023 2022 and 2021 Remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized and include deferred revenues invoices that have been issued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors In each fiscal year the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time and combined with foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other factors influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time As of May 31 2023 our remaining performance obligations were 679 billion approximately 49 of which we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months 35 over the subsequent month 13 to month 36 and the remainder thereafter Sales of Financing Receivables We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license hardware and services offerings through separate longterm payment contracts We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a nonrecourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts dates of execution We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables During fiscal 2023 2022 and 2021 20 billion 18 billion and 17 billion respectively of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions Business Combinations We apply the provisions of ASC 805 Business Combinations ASC 805 in accounting for our acquisitions ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets or to an acquisition of a business A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration where applicable our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement As a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill Upon the conclusion of a business acquisitions measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations and are accounted for separately from the business combination A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred Abandoned operating leases related to an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as RightofUse ROU asset impairment charges pursuant to ASC 842 Leases and are accounted for separately from the business combination In all periods 73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements presented when estimating the asset impairment charges assumptions were applied regarding estimated sublease payments to be received which can differ from actual results This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made For a given business acquisition we may identify certain preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and if so to determine their estimated amounts If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a nonincome tax related preacquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matters we will recognize an asset or a liability for such preacquisition contingency if 1 it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the business acquisition date and 2 the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination whichever comes first changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position In addition uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position Marketable and NonMarketable Investments In accordance with ASC 320 InvestmentsDebt Securities and based on our intentions regarding these instruments we classify substantially all of our marketable debt securities investments as availableforsale We carry these securities at fair value and report the unrealized gains and losses net of taxes as a component of stockholders equity except for any unrealized losses determined to be related to credit losses which we record within nonoperating expenses or income net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required All of our marketable debt securities investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations Investments in equity securities other than any equity method investments are generally recorded at their fair values if the fair values are readily determinable Nonmarketable equity securities for which the fair values are not readily determinable and where we do not have control of nor significant influence in the investee are recorded at cost less any impairment adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer with any gains or losses recorded as a component of nonoperating expenses or income net as of and for each reporting period For equity investments through which we have significant influence in but not control of the investee we account for such investments pursuant to the equity method of accounting whereby we record our proportionate share of the investees earnings or losses amortization of differences between our investment basis and underlying equity in net assets of the investee excluding component representing goodwill and impairment if any as a component of nonoperating expenses or income net for each reporting period Our nonmarketable debt investments and equity securities and related instruments totaled 16 billion and 12 billion as of May 31 2023 and 2022 respectively are subject to periodic impairment reviews and are classified as a part of noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets The majority of the nonmarketable investments held as of these dates were with a related party entity for which we follow the equity method of accounting We are also a counterparty to certain options to acquire additional equity interests in that entity at various times through June 2025 and we could obtain control of that entity should such options be exercised 74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fair Values of Financial Instruments We apply the provisions of ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement ASC 820 to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments The additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4 Allowances for Credit Losses We record allowances for credit losses based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices For those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current and expected future economic conditions We writeoff a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents marketable securities derivatives and trade receivables Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investmentgrade securities Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty creditrelated losses in these contracts is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of these contracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 2022 or 2021 We outsource the manufacturing assembly and delivery of the substantial majority of our hardware products to a variety of companies many of which are located outside the US Further we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of thirdparty manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these thirdparty manufacturers build our hardware products Any inability of these thirdparty manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our cloud and license and hardware businesses Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware expenses In addition we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete At the point of loss recognition a new lowercost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled 298 million and 314 million at May 31 2023 and 2022 respectively Other Receivables Other receivables represent valueadded tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled 798 million and 791 million at May 31 2023 and 2022 respectively 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Deferred Sales Commissions We defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud license support and hardware support contract Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over a period of benefit that we estimate to be four years We determine the period of benefit by taking into consideration the historical and expected durations of our customer contracts the expected useful lives of our technologies and other factors Sales commissions for renewal contracts relating to certain of our cloudbased arrangements are generally deferred and then amortized on a straightline basis over the related contractual renewal period which is generally one to three years Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and asset balances for deferred sales commissions are included in other current assets and other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets Property Plant and Equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation is computed using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives of the assets which range from one to 40 years Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms as appropriate Property plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2023 2022 or 2021 Goodwill Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are itemized in Note 6 below and are amortized over their useful lives which generally range from one to 10 years Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization The carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable When goodwill is assessed for impairment we have the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment optional assessment prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test Should the optional assessment be used for any given fiscal year qualitative factors considered for a reporting unit include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerations macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit If we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative test is then performed Otherwise no further testing is required For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis the discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis future economic and market conditions and market comparables of peer companies among others If as per the quantitative test the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit impairment is recognized for the difference limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting unit Our most recent goodwill impairment analysis was performed on March 1 2023 and did no t result in a goodwill impairment charge We did not recognize impairment charges in fiscal 2022 or 2021 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value If the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2023 2022 or 2021 At least annually we assess the useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets and may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a shorter amortization period is more reflective of the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows Derivative Financial Instruments During fiscal 2023 2022 and 2021 we used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of each reporting date ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met ie the instruments are accounted for as hedges The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding earnings offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge during each reporting period we record the change in fair value of the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCL in our consolidated balance sheets and the change is reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments because the implicit rate of the lease is generally not known ROU assets related to our operating lease liabilities are measured at lease inception based on the initial measurement of the lease liability plus any prepaid lease payments and less any lease incentives Our lease terms that are used in determining our operating lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options We amortize our ROU assets as operating lease expense generally on a straightline basis over the lease term and classify both the lease amortization and imputed interest as operating expenses We have lease agreements with lease and nonlease components and in such cases we generally account for the components as a single lease component We do not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for any lease with an original lease term of less than one year ROU assets related to our operating leases are included in other noncurrent assets shortterm operating lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and longterm operating lease liabilities are included in other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets Cash flow movements related to our lease activities are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities as presented in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31 2023 and 2022 Note 10 below provides additional information regarding our leases Legal and Other Contingencies We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings Quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure Descriptions of our accounting policies

servicebased restricted stock unit awards servicebased employee stock options performancebased stock options PSOs and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation which requires that sharebased payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values We account for forfeitures of stockbased awards as they occur For our servicebased stock awards we recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis over the service period of the award which is generally four years For our PSOs we recognize stockbased compensation expense on a straightline basis related to awards that are probable of achievement over the longer of the a estimated implicit service period for performancemetric achievement or b derived service period for marketbased metric achievement During our interim and annual reporting periods stockbased compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods may cause the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of shares that are expected to vest are reflected in the amount of stockbased compensation expense that we recognize for each PSO tranche on a cumulative catch up basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered Changes in estimates of the implicit service periods are recognized prospectively We record deferred tax assets for stockbased compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stockbased compensation recognized in each reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stockbased awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stockbased award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfallwindfall relative to the deferred tax asset established and recorded as a discrete detrimentbenefit to our provision for income taxes in such

liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized A twostep approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement We recognize interest and penalties

transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities such as inherent risk transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value An assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities or Level 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above May 31 2023 May 31 2022 Fair Value Measurements Using

investments mature within one year Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our instruments that were classified as Level 1 in the table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments that exist Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above were derived from the following nonbinding market consensus prices that were corroborated by observable market data quoted market prices for similar instruments or pricing models such as discounted cash flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data including reference rate yield curves among others 82 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Based on the trading prices of the

outstanding borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement FiveYear Term Loan Credit Agreement On August 16 2022 we entered into a 44 billion term loan credit agreement Term Loan Credit Agreement which provides for a total term loan commitment of 44 billion comprised of a 36 billion term loan Term Loan 1 Facility and a 790 million term loan Term Loan 2 Facility and together with the Term Loan 1 Facility the Term Loan Facilities The proceeds of the Term Loan Facilities may only be used to refinance indebtedness incurred under the Bridge Credit Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses On November 2 2022 the total term loan commitment was increased by 13 billion comprised of 11 billion under the Term Loan 1 Facility and 170 million under the Term Loan 2 Facility pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement We may request additional commitments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement up to a maximum of 60 billion each an Incremental Borrowing The use of proceeds of any Incremental Borrowing will be specified at the time of such borrowing and may include working capital purposes and other general corporate purposes We initially borrowed 44 billion on August 16 2022 and we borrowed an incremental 13 billion on November 2 2022 each under the Term Loan Facilities We used the net proceeds of the borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement to reduce the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Bridge Credit Agreement The effective interest rate for these borrowings during fiscal 2023 was 576 The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for repayment of borrowings under the Term Loan Facilities as follows an amount equal to the amount borrowed reduced by any prepayments multiplied by 125 on September 30 2024 and quarterly thereafter until June 30 2026 an amount equal to the amount borrowed reduced by any prepayments multiplied by 250 on September 30 2026 and quarterly thereafter until June 30 2027 and any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan 1 Facility will become fully due and payable on August 16 2027 and any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan 2 Facility will become fully due and payable on August 16 2025 subject to any extension of the Term Loan 2 Facility termination date as set out below unless the outstanding loans are prepaid earlier at the request of Oracle or accelerated by the lenders if an event of default occurs The termination date of the Term Loan 2 Facility may be extended at our sole option by up to 2 years The termination date of each Term Loan Facility may also be further extended at each lenders option by up to 2 years Interest is based on either a a Term SOFRbased formula plus a margin of 1475 basis points to 1975 basis points depending on the credit rating assigned to our longterm senior unsecured debt or b a Base Rate formula plus a margin of 475 basis points to 975 basis points depending on the same such credit rating each as set forth in the Term Loan Credit Agreement The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties covenants and events of default including the requirement that the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Interest Expense each term as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement of Oracle and its subsidiaries shall not be less than 30 to 10 at the end of any fiscal quarter during the period that the Term Loan Credit Agreement is effective If an event of default occurs under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and is not cured within the applicable grace period or waived any unpaid amounts under the Term Loan Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable We were in compliance with such covenants as of May 31 2023 87 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The summary above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Term Loan Credit Agreement Cash Flow HedgeInterest Rate Swap Agreements In August 2022 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements to manage the related interest rate risk of 44 billion borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement by effectively converting the floatingrate to fixedrate The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash flows associated with floatingrate interest payments of the Term Loan Credit Agreement by a fixed annual interest rate of 307 plus a margin depending on the credit rating assigned to our longterm senior unsecured debt as mentioned above We have designated these interest rate swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging The fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are recognized either as noncurrent assets or noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets Changes in the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into nonoperating income or expense net in the same period that corresponding interest expense is recognized We do not use any interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes Cerner Senior Notes and Other Borrowings In connection with our acquisition of Cerner we assumed 10 billion par value of legacy Cerner senior notes The acquisition triggered a mandatory offer to prepay such senior notes in accordance with the terms of the underlying note purchase agreements Holders of 931 million par value of senior notes exercised the option for prepayment and accordingly such notes together with accrued interest were redeemed on June 8 2022 and the remaining outstanding senior notes together with accrued interest were redeemed during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 600 million of principal amount of revolving credit loans The entire loan along with accrued interest was settled and the credit facility was terminated on June 8 2022 Commercial Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes During the first quarter of fiscal 2023 our commercial paper program was increased to 60 billion Our commercial paper program allows us to issue and sell unsecured shortterm promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws pursuant to dealer agreements with various banks and an Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas There were 563 million of outstanding commercial paper notes as of May 31 2023 none outstanding as of May 31 2022 that mature at various dates through June 2023 The effective interest rate including issuance costs was 489 for fiscal 2023 We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes 8 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES Fiscal 2022 Oracle Restructuring Plan During

awards including restricted stockbased awards nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options as well as stock purchase rights and stock appreciation rights to our eligible employees officers and directors who are also employees or consultants independent consultants and advisers In fiscal 2022 our stockholders upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors the Board approved the adoption of the Amended and Restated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan the 2020 Plan and together with the 2000 Plan the Plans which increased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued under the 2020 Plan by 300 million shares The total number of shares authorized under the 2020 Plan is i 390000000 shares plus ii 132921827 shares which were the number of shares that were unissued and available for grant under the 2000 Plan as of the date that the 2020 Plan was originally adopted plus iii the number of shares granted and outstanding as of the date that the 2020 Plan was originally adopted which would have been available again for issuance under the terms of the 2000 Plan had the 2020 Plan not been adopted Under the 2020 Plan for each share granted as a full value award in the form of a restricted stock unit RSU or a performancebased restricted stock award PSU an equivalent of 25 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant As of May 31 2023 146 million unvested RSUs 36 million performancebased stock options PSOs of which 6 million shares were vested and servicebased stock options SOs to purchase 28 million shares of common stock

we have not issued any stock options under the 2020 Plan or any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under either of the Plans The vesting schedule for all awards granted under the Plans is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board RSUs generally require servicebased vesting of 25 annually over four years SOs were previously granted under the 2000 Plan at not less than fair market value become exercisable generally 25 annually over four years of service and generally expire 10 years from the date of grant PSOs granted under the 2000 Plan to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer in fiscal 2018 consisted of seven numerically equivalent vesting tranches that potentially could vest One tranche which was based solely on the attainment of a marketbased metric was achieved and vested in fiscal 2022 Each of the remaining six tranches requires the attainment of both a performance metric and a market capitalization metric by May 31 2022 which was subsequently extended by three additional fiscal years to May 31 2025 via an amendment approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board during fiscal 2022 If any of the remaining operational and market capitalization performance goals are achieved before May 31 2025 additional tranches may vest assuming continued employment and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board certifies that performance has been achieved Upon amendment of the PSOs in fiscal 2022 we estimated the revised fair values of the six unvested tranches of the PSOs using a Monte Carlo simulation approach We are recognizing incremental stockbased compensation expense related to these amended awards for any of the remaining unvested tranches that are probable of achievement over the longer of the a estimated implicit service period for performancemetric achievement or b derived service period for marketbased metric achievement Stockbased compensation associated with a vesting tranche where vesting is no longer determined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the period when such a determination is made We have estimated remaining service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement as of May 31 2023 to be approximately one to two years In connection with certain of our acquisitions we assumed certain outstanding restricted stockbased awards and stock options under each acquired companys respective stock plans or we substituted substantially

terms of the Directors Plan 10 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares In prior years we granted stock options at not less than fair market value that vest over four year s and expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant Currently we only grant RSUs that vest fully on the oneyear anniversary of the date of grant The Directors Plan was most recently amended on April 29 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards if any to each nonemployee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis as well as automatic grants for chairing certain Board committees subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors Plan In April 2020 the Compensation Committee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic RSU grants to each nonemployee director from 400000 to 350000 and eliminated all equity grants for chairing board committees As of May 31 2023 approximately 40000 unvested RSUs and stock options to

periods presented are the result of the mix of income and losses earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates Our provision for benefit from income taxes varied from the tax computed at the US federal statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2023 2022 and 2021 primarily due to earnings in foreign operations state taxes the US research and development tax credit

considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States At May 31 2023 the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which US income taxes have not been provided was approximately 110 billion If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated 98 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction At May 31 2023 assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately 20 billion Our net deferred tax assets were 65 billion and 68 billion as of May 31 2023 and 2022 respectively We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change The valuation allowance was 19 billion and 17 billion as of May 31 2023 and 2022 respectively A majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31 2023 and 2022 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period as defined above whichever comes first At May 31 2023 we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 380 million which are subject to limitation on their utilization Approximately 304 million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2038 Approximately 76 million of these federal net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 22 billion at May 31 2023 which expire between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2043 and are subject to limitations on their utilization We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 19 billion at May 31 2023 which are subject to limitations on their utilization Approximately 18 billion of these foreign net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates The remainder of the foreign net operating losses approximately 61 million expire between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2039 At May 31 2023 we had federal capital loss carryforwards of approximately 141 million which expire in fiscal 2026 We had state capital loss carryforwards of approximately 314 million which expire between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2036 We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately 14 billion at May 31 2023 which are subject to limitations on their utilization Approximately 933 million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards approximately 438 million expire in various years between fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2043 We classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits including acquisitions were as follows Year Ended May 31 in millions 2023 2022 2021 Gross unrecognized tax benefits as of June 1 7284 6912 6972 Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years 709 66 225 Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years 45 24 836 Increases related to tax positions taken

unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate if recognized We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for benefit from income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations of 111 million 93 million and 166 million during fiscal 2023 2022 and 2021 respectively Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31 2023 and 2022 were 17 billion and 16 billion respectively Domestically US federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2021 Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process the most significant of which include issues related to transfer pricing domestic production activity onetime transition tax foreign tax credits research and development credits and state economic nexus With respect to all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate we believe that it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2023 our gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months by as much as 538 million 442 million net of offsetting tax benefits Our US federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2013 and with some exceptions we are no longer subject to audit for those periods Our US state income tax returns with some exceptions have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods Internationally tax authorities for numerous nonUS jurisdictions are also examining or have examined returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2023 Many of the relevant tax years are at an advanced stage in examination or subsequent controversy resolution processes the most significant of which include issues related to transfer pricing and withholding tax The manner in which those issues are resolved and the timing thereof could potentially result in a range of decreases or increases in our unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months We believe it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2023 the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease whether by payment release or a combination of both in the next 12 months by as much as 767 million 262 million net of offsetting tax benefits We also believe it was reasonably possible that as of May 31 2023 the gross unrecognized tax benefits could increase in the next 12 months by as much as 637 million 111 million net of offsetting US tax benefits With some exceptions we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in nonUS jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001 We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries including in particular Australia Brazil Canada Germany India Indonesia Israel Italy Mexico New Zealand Pakistan Saudi Arabia South Korea and Spain where the amounts under controversy are significant In some although not all cases we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by or any negotiated agreements with these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary If our estimates of the federal state and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment it could result in a further charge to expense We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits However there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof 14 SEGMENT INFORMATION ASC 280 Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker or decisionmaking group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance Our chief operating decision makers CODMs are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer We are organized by line of business and geographically While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed The tabular information below presents financial 100 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements information that is provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the companys performance and allocating company resources We have three businessescloud and license hardware and serviceseach of which is comprised of a single operating segment All three of our businesses market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes government agencies educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs Our cloud and license business engages in the sale marketing and delivery of our enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and onpremise deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings and our cloud license and onpremise license offerings Cloud services and license support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly billed to customers in advance delivered to customers over time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms Cloud services and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available and for which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual term Cloud license and onpremise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses generally on a perpetual basis to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and onpremise IT environments We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to the customer to download and use which typically is immediate upon signature of the license contract In each fiscal year our cloud and license business contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter ie in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year as we receive payments from these contracts Our hardware business provides infrastructure technologies including Oracle Engineered Systems servers storage industryspecific hardware operating systems virtualization management and other hardwarerelated software to support diverse IT environments Our hardware business also offers hardware support which provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of their hardware products and can also include product repairs maintenance services and technical support services that are typically delivered and recognized ratably over the contractual term Our services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies We do not track our assets for each business Consequently it is not practical to show assets by operating segment 101 Table of
