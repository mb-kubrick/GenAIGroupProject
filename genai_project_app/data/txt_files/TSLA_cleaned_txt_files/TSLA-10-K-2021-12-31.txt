needs We have developed software that simplifies and expedites the design process as well as mounting hardware that facilitates solar panel installation Sales and Marketing Historically we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products and we believe we will continue to do so Such media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs Automotive Direct Sales Our vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of companyowned stores In some jurisdictions we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory manage warranty service and pricing educate consumers about electric vehicles maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback We reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a locationbylocation level from time to time to optimize our current sales channels Sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to volatility from time to time Used Vehicle Sales Our used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the tradein of a customers existing Tesla or nonTesla vehicle with the sale of a new or used Tesla vehicle The Tesla and nonTesla vehicles we acquire as tradeins are subsequently remarketed either directly by us or through third parties We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns Public Charging We have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers which are our industrial grade highspeed vehicle chargers Where possible we colocate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power Supercharger stations are typically placed along welltraveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick reliable and ubiquitous charging with convenient minimal stops Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs We also work with a wide variety of hospitality retail and public destinations as well as businesses with commuting employees to offer additional charging options for our customers These Destination Charging and workplace locations deploy Tesla Wall Connectors to provide charging to Tesla vehicle owners who patronize or are employed at their businesses We also work with singlefamily homeowners and multifamily residential entities to deploy home charging solutions 6 InApp Upgrades As our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely overtheair our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the Tesla app or through the invehicle user interface We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a subscription basis in the future Energy Generation and Storage We market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of channels We emphasize simplicity standardization and accessibility to make it easy and costeffective for customers to adopt clean energy while reducing our customer acquisition costs In the US we offer residential solar and energy storage products directly through our website stores and galleries as well as through our network of channel partners Outside of the US we use our international sales organization and a network of channel partners to market and sell these products for the residential market We also sell Powerwall directly to utilities In the case of products sold to utilities or channel partners such partners typically sell the product to residential customers and manage the installation in customer homes We sell our commercial and utilityscale energy storage systems to customers through our US and international sales organization and our channel partner network In certain jurisdictions we also sell installed solar energy systems with or without energy storage to commercial customers through PPA transactions Service and Warranty Automotive Service We provide service for our electric vehicles at our companyowned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work remotely at customers homes or other locations Performing vehicle service ourselves provides us with the capability to identify problems and implement solutions and improvements faster and optimize logistics and inventory better than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and remedy many problems remotely and proactively Vehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans We provide a manufacturers limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell which may include separate limited warranties on certain components specific types of damage or battery capacity retention We also currently offer extended service plans that provide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions Energy Generation and Storage We provide service and repairs to our energy product customers including under warranty where applicable We generally provide manufacturers limited warranties with our energy storage product and offer certain extended

Fremont Factory and other local manufacturing facilities We also manufacture and develop certain parts and components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality standards such as Model S and Model X battery packs and our proprietary lithiumion battery cells at these locations Gigafactory Nevada near Reno Nevada Our battery material cell module and battery pack production for Model 3 Model Y and our energy products are manufactured in one location at Gigafactory Nevada In addition we manufacture vehicle drive units and energy storage components there Gigafactory Nevada allows us to access high volumes of lithiumion battery cells manufactured by our partner Panasonic there while achieving a significant reduction in the cost of our battery packs We continue to invest in Gigafactory Nevada to achieve additional output there Gigafactory New York in Buffalo New York We use Gigafactory New York for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components energy storage components and Supercharger components and for other functions Gigafactory Shanghai in China We established Gigafactory Shanghai to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs We continue to increase the degree of localized procurement and manufacturing there Gigafactory Shanghai is representative of our plan to iteratively improve our manufacturing operations as we establish new factories as we implemented the learnings from our Model 3 and Model Y ramp at the Fremont Factory to commence and ramp our production at Gigafactory Shanghai quickly and costeffectively Other Manufacturing Generally we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facilities We also intend to further increase costcompetitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding local manufacturing including at Gigafactory Berlin in Germany and Gigafactory Texas in Austin Texas which will begin production in 2022 Supply Chain Our products use thousands of purchased parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world We have developed close relationships with vendors of key parts such as battery cells electronics and complex vehicle assemblies Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or are similar across many product lines allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale As is the case for most automotive companies most of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers Where multiple sources are available for certain key components we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize production risks owing to disruptions in their supply We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times 8 Our products use various raw materials including aluminum steel cobalt lithium nickel and copper Pricing for these materials is governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control such as supply and demand and market speculation We strive to execute longterm supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible and we currently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies in order to meet the needs of our operations Governmental Programs Incentives and Regulations Globally both the operation of our business by us and the ownership of our products by our customers are impacted by various government programs incentives and other arrangements Our business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions Programs and Incentives California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives We have agreements with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority that provide multiyear sales tax exclusions on purchases of manufacturing equipment that will be used for specific purposes including the expansion and ongoing development of electric vehicles and powertrain production in California thus reducing our cost basis in the related assets in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Gigafactory NevadaNevada Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada These incentives are available until June 2024 or June 2034 depending on the incentive and primarily offset related costs in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Gigafactory New YorkNew York State Investment and Lease We have a lease through the Research Foundation for the State University of New York the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York Under the lease and a related research and development agreement we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility We are required to comply with certain covenants including hiring and cumulative investment targets This incentive offsets the related lease costs of the facility in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID19 pandemic we were granted a deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets through December 31 2021 in an amendment memorialized in August 2021 As of December 31 2021 we are in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo Gigafactory ShanghaiLand Use Rights and Economic Benefits We have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai Under the terms of the arrangement we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023 In addition the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai These incentives offset the related costs of our facilities in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Finally the Shanghai government granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15 to certain eligible enterprises which is lower than the 25 statutory corporate income tax rate in China Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this lower rate for 2019 through 2023 This lower tax rate reduces the income tax provision in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas we entered into a 20year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 7080 of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas These incentives will offset the related costs in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K 9 Automotive Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zeroemission vehicles ZEVs greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuel We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Energy Storage System Incentives and Policies While the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development there are various policies incentives and financial mechanisms at the federal state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage For example energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energyrelated US federal tax credits described below The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy markets In addition California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage and behindthemeter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration In such transactions they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Solar Energy System Incentives and Policies US federal state and local governments have established various policies incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy These incentives include tax credits cash grants tax abatements and rebates In particular Sections 48 and 25D of the US Internal Revenue Code currently provide a tax credit of 26 of qualified commercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems These tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to decline andor expire in 2023 and beyond Regulations Vehicle Safety and Testing In the US our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles such as crashworthiness and occupant protection requirements While our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions FMVSS are subject to change from time to time As a manufacturer we must selfcertify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the US We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA including the CAFE standards Theft Prevention Act requirements labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims field reports death and injury reports and foreign recalls and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting The US Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturers suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing In addition federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings as determined by the US Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency the EPA and New Car Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA if available Our vehicles sold outside of the US are subject to similar foreign compliance safety environmental and other regulations Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the US and may require redesign andor retesting Some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features Additionally the European Union established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commenced in 2020 SelfDriving Vehicles Generally laws pertaining to selfdriving vehicles are evolving globally and in some cases may create restrictions on features that we develop While there are currently no federal US regulations specifically pertaining to selfdriving vehicles or selfdriving equipment NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on selfdriving vehicles and retains the authority to investigate andor take action on the safety of any vehicle equipment or features operating on public roads Certain US states also have legal restrictions on the operation registration or licensure of selfdriving vehicles and many other states are considering them This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to selfdriving vehicles in the US 10 In markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe some requirements restrict the design of advanced driverassistance or selfdriving features which can compromise or prevent their use entirely Other applicable laws both current and proposed may hinder the path and timeline to introducing selfdriving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply Other key markets including China continue to consider selfdriving regulation Any implemented regulations may differ materially from those in the US and Europe which may further increase the legal complexity of selfdriving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation In the US state laws regulate the manufacture distribution sale and service of automobiles and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturers ability to deliver or service vehicles To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer we generally conduct the sale out of the state In certain such states we have opened galleries that serve an educational purpose and where the title transfer may not occur Some automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations Certain dealer associations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations We expect such challenges to continue and we intend to actively fight any such efforts Battery Safety and Testing Our battery packs are subject to various US and international regulations that govern transport of dangerous goods defined to include lithiumion batteries which may present a risk in transportation We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations We use lithiumion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products The use storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs and we are also piloting our own recycling technology Solar EnergyGeneral We are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity To operate our systems we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities Sales of electricity and nonsale equipment leases by third parties such as our leases and PPAs have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions Solar EnergyNet Metering Most states in the US make net energy metering or net metering available to solar customers Net metering typically allows solar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid In certain jurisdictions regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so Competition Automotive The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as we introduce additional vehicles in a broader crosssection of the passenger and commercial vehicle market and expand our vehicles capabilities 11 We believe that our vehicles compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification as well as based on their propulsion technology For example Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to mediumsized sedans and compact SUVs which are extremely competitive markets Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers however many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles Overall we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions including the introduction of electric vehicles into rental car company fleets promote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the US China and Europe and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles In addition several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles including plugin versions We also believe that there is increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering selfdriving technologies charging solutions and other features and services and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot FSD and neural network capabilities Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings Energy Generation and Storage Energy Storage Systems The market for energy storage products is also highly competitive and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems We compete with these companies based on price energy density and efficiency We believe that the specifications and features of our products our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets Solar Energy Systems The primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems while others only provide financing for these installations We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems Intellectual Property We place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio As part of our business we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other measures including through employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements For example we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs within our products and technologies in the electric vehicle market as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith We made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common rapidlyevolving platform for electric vehicles thereby benefiting ourselves other companies making electric vehicles and the world Environmental Social and Governance ESG and Human Capital Resources ESG The very purpose of Teslas existence is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy We believe the world cannot reduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal As we expand we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one including with respect to waste reduction and water usage and we are focused on reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain We are committed to only sourcing responsibly produced materials and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains We have a zerotolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement As our production volumes increase our incidents per vehicle continue to drop 12 We believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals including with respect to ESG We continue to evolve a governance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent with high principles of business ethics Our ESG Sustainability Council is made up of leaders from across our company and regularly presents to our Board of Directors which oversees our ESG impacts initiatives and priorities Human Capital Resources As of December 31 2021 our fulltime count for our and our subsidiaries employees worldwide was 99290 To date we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity equity and inclusion principles and practices into our core values We want to attract a pool of diverse and exceptional candidates and support their career growth once they become employees Our efforts begin at the entry level with development apprenticeship and internship programs in local high schools community colleges and fouryear colleges In addition we seek to hire based on talent rather than solely on educational pedigree and have provided thousands of job openings including in our local communities for capable workers from various backgrounds to learn valuable skills in critical operations such as in manufacturing vehicle service and energy product installation We also emphasize in our evaluation and career development efforts internal mobility opportunities for employees to drive professional development Our goal is a longterm upwardbound career at Tesla for every employee which we believe also drives our retention efforts Our ability to retain our talented workforce is correlated to our compensation practices and culture of open communication We provide a highly competitive wage that meets or exceeds that of comparable manufacturing roles even before equity and benefits are factored in In addition the majority of our employees have the opportunity to receive additional Tesla equity each year based on their performance We continue to review salary and wages against benchmarks and adjust to ensure wages are competitive and have instituted a robust process for ensuring pay equity across our organization In addition we provide a comprehensive range of benefits options including nocost paycheck contributions for medical dental and vision plan options for employees and family members Our employees have the right to freely discuss their wages benefits and terms and conditions of employment and to raise complaints internally and externally We encourage our employees to bring any concerns or complaints they have to any member of management and any employee who is subjected to a witness or has knowledge of any conduct that violates Tesla policies is asked to immediately report the conduct Our employees can report concerns to their supervisor or human resources partner as well as an integrity line to report concerns anonymously and without fear of retaliation that is available 24 hours a day seven days a week Concerns are reviewed in accordance with established protocols by investigators with expertise who also periodically review for trends and outcomes for remediation and appropriate controls Tesla provides employee training on workplace conduct at least annually and in 2021 implemented a campaign to rehighlight different reporting mechanisms available to employees We also believe that our ability to retain our workforce is dependent on our ability to foster an environment that is sustainably safe respectful fair and inclusive of everyone and promotes diversity equity and inclusion inside and outside of our business From our outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions to sponsoring employee resource groups across numerous locations including Asian Pacific Islanders at Tesla Black at Tesla Intersectionality Latinos at Tesla LGBTQ at Tesla Veterans at Tesla and Women in Tesla we engage these networks as key business resources and sources of actionable feedback We are also working on diversity efforts in our supply chain to expand our outreach and support to small and largescale suppliers from underrepresented communities to emphasize this culture with our own employees Available Information We file

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future results The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business We may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global COVID19 pandemic Since the first quarter of 2020 there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID19 pandemic Government regulations and shifting social behaviors have limited or closed nonessential transportation government functions business activities and persontoperson interactions In some cases the relaxation of such trends has been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce including in parts of the US and the rest of the world During 2020 we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide and certain of our suppliers also shut down operations temporarily or permanently including during the recently reimposed lockdowns in certain parts of the world We instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our US operations were scaled back Temporary impediments to administrative activities supporting our operations also hampered our product deliveries and deployments Global trade conditions and consumer trends that originated during the pandemic continue to persist and may also have longlasting adverse impact on us and our industries independently of the progress of the pandemic For example pandemicrelated issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts Similarly increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of semiconductors which has caused challenges in our supply chain and production In addition labor shortages resulting from the pandemic including worker absenteeism may lead to increased difficulty in hiring and retaining manufacturing and service workers as well as increased labor costs Sustaining our production trajectory will require the ongoing readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors a stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation including for travel and visa allowances The contingencies inherent in the construction of and ramp at new facilities such as Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges We cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact Ultimately we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production workforce and other resources accordingly If we experience unfavorable global market conditions or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again our business prospects financial condition and operating results may be harmed We may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features or we may be unable to control our manufacturing costs We have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features For example we encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes In addition we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and design features for our products There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features In particular our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of massmarket vehicles including Model 3 and Model Y which we are planning to achieve through multiple factories worldwide We have relatively limited experience to date in manufacturing Model 3 and Model Y at high volumes and even less experience building and ramping vehicle production lines across multiple factories in different geographies In order to be successful we will need to implement maintain and ramp efficient and costeffective manufacturing capabilities processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California Nevada Texas China and Germany We will also need to hire train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs If we are not successful in achieving these goals we could face delays in establishing andor sustaining our Model 3 and Model Y ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets We may also experience similar future delays in launching andor ramping production of our energy storage products and Solar Roof new product versions or variants such as the recently updated Model S and Model X new vehicles such as Tesla Semi Cybertruck and the new Tesla Roadster and future features and services based on artificial intelligence such as new Autopilot or FSD 14 functionalities the autonomous Tesla ridehailing network and robotics Likewise we may encounter delays with the design construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products Any delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future products features and services or in doing so costeffectively and with high quality may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results We may be unable to grow our global product sales delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging networks or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth Our success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities We are targeting with Model 3 and Model Y a global mass demographic with a broad range of potential customers in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products We currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region Likewise as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets Because we do not have independent dealer networks we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers We may face difficulties with deliveries at increasing volumes particularly in international markets requiring significant transit times For example we saw challenges in ramping our logistics channels in China and Europe to initially deliver Model 3 there in the first quarter of 2019 We have deployed a number of delivery models such as deliveries to customers homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally Likewise as we ramp our energy products we are working to substantially increase our production and installation capabilities If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand our business financial condition and operating results may be harmed Moreover because of our unique expertise with our vehicles we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized professionals If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles particularly highervolume and relatively newer additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory Similarly the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world There is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales delivery installation servicing and vehicle charging targets globally that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them As we expand we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale installation and servicing of our products the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers If we fail to manage our growth effectively it may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results Our future growth and success are dependent upon consumers demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an automotive industry that is generally competitive cyclical and volatile If the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other our business prospects financial condition and operating results may be harmed We are still at an earlier stage of development and have limited resources and production relative to established competitors that offer internal combustion engine vehicles In addition electric vehicles still comprise a small percentage of overall vehicle sales As a result the market for our vehicles could be negatively affected by numerous factors such as perceptions about electric vehicle features quality safety performance and cost perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge and access to charging facilities competition including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles plugin hybrid electric vehicles and high fueleconomy internal combustion engine vehicles volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline such as wide fluctuations in crude oil prices during 2020 government regulations and economic incentives and concerns about our future viability 15 Finally the target demographics for our vehicles particularly Model 3 and Model Y are highly competitive Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to further volatility Our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules prices quality and volumes that are acceptable to us or we may be unable to manage these components effectively Our products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers including singlesource direct suppliers which exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages Unexpected changes in business conditions materials pricing labor issues wars trade policies natural disasters such as the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan health epidemics such as the global COVID19 pandemic trade and shipping disruptions port congestions and other factors beyond our or our suppliers control could also affect these suppliers ability to deliver components to us or to remain solvent and operational For example a global shortage of semiconductors has been reported since early 2021 and has caused challenges in the manufacturing industry and impacted our supply chain and production as well We have used alternative parts and programmed software to mitigate the challenges caused by these shortages but there is no guarantee we may be able to continually do so as we scale production to meet our growth targets Additionally if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays idle manufacturing facilities product design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts Moreover significant increases in our production such as for Model 3 and Model Y or product design changes by us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time Our suppliers may not be willing or able to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost quality and volume needs or to do so may cost us more which may require us to replace them with other sources Finally we have limited vehicle manufacturing experience outside of the Fremont Factory and we may experience issues increasing the level of localized procurement at our Gigafactory Shanghai and at future factories such as Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all Additionally we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce especially in light of the increases in materials pricing Any of these occurrences may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results As the scale of our vehicle production increases we will also need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain and parts management we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and writeoff costs which may harm our business and operating results We may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines costs and production ramps at new factories or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there Our ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories The construction of and commencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements procurement and maintenance of construction environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion potential supply chain constraints hiring training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture highquality units at scale For example we are currently constructing Gigafactory Berlin under conditional permits in anticipation of being granted final permits Moreover we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory We have limited experience to date with developing and implementing manufacturing innovations outside of the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Shanghai In particular the majority of our design and engineering resources are currently located in California In order to meet our expectations for our new factories we must expand and manage localized design and engineering talent and resources If we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines costs capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories expanding and managing teams to implement iterative design and production changes there maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating and maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there our business prospects operating results and financial condition may be harmed We will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells including through the development and manufacture of our own cells and control our related costs We are dependent on the continued supply of lithiumion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products and we will require substantially more cells to grow our business according to our plans Currently we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited CATL for these cells We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number 16 of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing suppliers Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products In the long term we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us which we believe will be more efficient manufacturable at greater volumes and more costeffective than currently available cells However our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required and may continue to require significant investments and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we have planned or at all If we are unable to do so we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at potentially greater costs either of which may harm our business and operating results In addition the cost of battery cells whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us depends in part upon the prices and availability of raw materials such as lithium nickel cobalt andor other metals The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials including as a result of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to cells and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices Moreover any such attempts to increase product prices may harm our brand prospects and operating results We face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors The worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future For example Model 3 and Model Y face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive entrylevel premium sedan and compact SUV markets A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers as well as other companies have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles including hybrid plugin hybrid and fully electric vehicles as well as the market for selfdriving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms In some cases our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe andor have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future Many of our competitors have significantly greater or betterestablished resources than we do to devote to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their products Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales price reductions revenue shortfalls loss of customers and loss of market share which may harm our business financial condition and operating results We also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers developers installers and service providers of competing energy technologies as well as from large utilities Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of residential customer defaults under our existing longterm leases and PPAs Risks Related to Our Operations We may experience issues with lithiumion cells or other components manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai which may harm the production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products Our plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithiumion battery cell production including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada In addition we produce several vehicle components such as battery modules and packs and drive units at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai and we also manufacture energy storage products at Gigafactory Nevada In the past some of the manufacturing lines for certain product components took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity and additional bottlenecks may arise in the future as we continue to increase the production rate and introduce new lines If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai production or if we are unable to do so costeffectively or hire and retain highlyskilled personnel there our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited which may harm our business and operating results Finally the high volumes of lithiumion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured at Gigafactory Nevada are stored and recycled at our various facilities Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory political economic tax and labor conditions We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements political uncertainty and social environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions including markets in which we generate significant sales over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable Our operations in such jurisdictions particularly as a company based in the US create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures organizing local operating entities establishing staffing and managing foreign business locations attracting local customers navigating foreign 17 government taxes regulations and permit requirements enforceability of our contractual rights trade restrictions customs regulations tariffs and price or exchange controls and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products Such conditions may increase our costs impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively Our business may suffer if our products or features contain defects fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional If our products contain design or manufacturing defects that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD features take longer than expected to become enabled are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation our ability to develop market and sell our products and services may be harmed and we may experience delivery delays product recalls product liability breach of warranty and consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses For example we are developing selfdriving and driver assist technologies to rely on visionbased sensors unlike alternative technologies in development that additionally require other redundant sensors There is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial functional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as expected in the timeframe we anticipate or at all Our products are also highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects or errors or be subject to external attacks Issues experienced by our customers have included those related to the Model S and Model X 17inch display screen the panoramic roof and the 12volt battery in the Model S the seats and doors in the Model X and the operation of solar panels installed by us Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible such efforts may not be timely may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers While we have performed extensive internal testing on our products and features we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate their longterm quality reliability durability and performance characteristics There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers We may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims The automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected As is true for other automakers our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury and such accidents where Autopilot or FSD features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention We have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of such new technologies that we are pioneering In addition the battery packs that we produce make use of lithiumion cells On rare occasions lithiumion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithiumion cells While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cells release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur in particular due to a highspeed crash Likewise as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages product recalls or redesign efforts and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and timeconsuming In most jurisdictions we generally selfinsure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance We will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our longterm business prospects in order to succeed In order to maintain and grow our business we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers suppliers analysts investors ratings agencies and other parties in our longterm financial viability and business prospects Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors customer unfamiliarity with our products any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing delivery and service operations to meet demand competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services our quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations and other factors including those over which we have no control In particular Teslas products business results of operations statements and actions are wellpublicized by a range of third parties Such attention includes frequent criticism which is often exaggerated or unfounded such as speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team Any such negative perceptions whether caused by us or not may harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed We may be unable to effectively grow or manage the compliance residual value financing and credit risks related to our various financing programs We offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets Depending on the country such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us 18 under which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state andor local financial regulations and consumer protection laws governing these transactions we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties The profitability of any directlyleased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles residual values at the outset of the leases and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and demand of our used vehicles economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments to our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our vehicle leasing program The funding and growth of this program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing andor business partners If we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds partners or other financing sources and compelling alternative financing programs are not available for our customers who may expect or need such options we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries Furthermore if our vehicle leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk Similarly we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs under which such counterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at predetermined amounts However actual resale values are subject to fluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above If the actual resale values of any vehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the predetermined amounts we have offered our financial condition and operating results may be harmed Finally our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk In the event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations to us on a timely basis or at all If a significant number of our customers default we may incur substantial credit losses andor impairment charges with respect to the underlying assets We must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York relating to our Gigafactory New York We are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the SUNY Foundation These agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York which we have primarily used for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other solar products and components energy storage components and Supercharger components and for other lessorapproved functions Under this agreement we are obligated to among other things meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo New York and spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30 2018 As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID19 pandemic we were granted a deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets through December 31 2021 in an amendment memorialized in August 2021 As of December 31 2021 we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo While we expect to have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a program payment of 41 million to the SUNY Foundation for such year the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York which may require us to pay additional penalties andor the need to adjust certain of our operations in particular our production ramp of the Solar Roof or other components Any of the foregoing events may harm our business financial condition and operating results If we are unable to attract hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel our ability to compete may be harmed The loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the development introduction and ramp of our products and services In particular we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract hire and retain a large number of engineering manufacturing marketing sales and delivery service installation technology and support personnel especially to support our planned highvolume product sales market and geographical expansion and technological innovations Recruiting efforts particularly for senior employees may be timeconsuming which may delay the execution of our plans If we are not successful in managing these risks our business financial condition and operating results may be harmed Employees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors such as a very competitive labor market for talented individuals with automotive or technology experience or any negative publicity related to us In regions where we 19 have or will have operations particularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers there is strong competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicles engineering and electrical and building construction expertise Moreover we may be impacted by perceptions relating to reductions in force that we have conducted in the past in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce costs and the departure of certain senior personnel for various reasons Likewise as a result of our temporary suspension of various US manufacturing operations in the first half of 2020 in April 2020 we temporarily furloughed certain hourly employees and reduced most salaried employees base salaries We also compete with both mature and prosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and startups and emerging companies that promise shortterm growth opportunities Finally our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins with an emphasis on equitybased awards and benefits in order to closely align their incentives with the longterm interests of our stockholders We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for future increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans If we are unable to obtain the requisite stockholder approvals for such future increases we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel may be harmed We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer Although Mr Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla Mr Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles and is involved in other emerging technology ventures Our information technology systems or data or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyberattacks or other security incidents which could result in data breaches intellectual property theft claims litigation regulatory investigations significant liability reputational damage and other adverse consequences We continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow such as product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sales service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance systems This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the US and abroad While we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft data breaches sabotage and other external or internal cyberattacks or misappropriation our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware ransomware viruses denialofservice attacks phishing attacks social engineering computer hacking unauthorized access exploitation of bugs defects and vulnerabilities breakdowns damage interruptions system malfunctions power outages terrorism acts of vandalism security breaches security incidents inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or other third parties and other cyberattacks To the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition use corruption loss destruction alteration or dissemination of our data including intellectual property and personal information or our products or vehicles or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred it could disrupt our business harm our reputation compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws subject us to time consuming distracting and expensive litigation regulatory investigation and oversight mandatory corrective action require us to verify the correctness of database contents or otherwise subject us to liability under laws regulations and contractual obligations including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure andor reputational harm We also rely on service providers and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks Our service providers including our workforce management software provider have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects bugs or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident or other disruption to our or our service providers systems Our ability to monitor our service providers security measures is limited and in any event malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures Further the implementation maintenance segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time support and cost and there are inherent risks associated with developing improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating current systems including disruptions to the related areas of business operation These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure parts or supplies or manufacture sell deliver and service products adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefits under tax laws and other applicable regulations Moreover if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these systems as planned our operations may be disrupted our ability to accurately andor timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial results Moreover our proprietary information 20 including intellectual property and personal information could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products Our products contain complex information technology systems For example our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with builtin data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks our products and their systems malicious entities have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such networks products and systems to gain control of or to change our products functionality user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability However there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be identified or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations In addition regardless of their veracity reports of unauthorized access to our products their systems or data as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products their systems or data are capable of being hacked may harm our brand prospects and operating results We have been the subject of such reports in the past Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities It is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as us to belong to a union which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages Moreover regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the US mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies operations Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union or we may be required to become a union signatory From time to time labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations as part of which such unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board the NLRB and they may do so in the future In September 2019 an administrative law judge issued a recommended decision for Tesla on certain issues and against us on certain others In March 2021 the NLRB adopted a portion of the recommendation and overturned others Tesla appealed the decision to the United States Circuit Court for the Fifth Circuit which is currently pending Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Teslas treatment of our employees Furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results We may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions As a manufacturing company we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from for example industrywide issues with airbags from a particular supplier concerns of corrosion in certain Model S and Model X power steering assist motor bolts suspension failures in certain Model S and Model X issues with certain Model S and Model X media control units and torqueing of bolts to internal specifications on certain Model 3 and Model Y misalignment of the frunk latch assembly on certain Model S and unavailability of the rearview camera display on certain Model 3 In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that shows the actual safety risk to be nonexistent In the future we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations such as US federal motor vehicle safety standards Such recalls whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers could result in significant expense supply chain complications and service burdens and may harm our brand business prospects financial condition and operating results Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims We provide a manufacturers warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell We also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell including on their installation and maintenance For components not manufactured by us we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers warranties but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the life of such components As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that guarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract Under these performance guarantees we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls even if they result from failures in components 21 from third party manufacturers These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products our financial condition and operating results may be harmed Warranty reserves include our managements best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to products such as Model 3 Model Y and Solar Roof that we have introduced relatively recently andor that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future Our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks We may be subject in the ordinary course of business to losses resulting from products liability accidents acts of God and other claims against us for which we may have no insurance coverage As a general matter we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do and in some cases we do not maintain any at all Additionally the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or selfinsured retentions policy limitations and exclusions and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts which may harm our financial condition and operating results Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business The terms of certain of our credit facilities including our senior assetbased revolving credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business including restrictions on our ability to among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees create liens repurchase stock or make other restricted payments and make certain voluntary prepayments of specified debt In addition under certain circumstances we are required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio As a result of these covenants our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions including to obtain additional financing as needed may be restricted Furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt If any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it Additional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them Our business and our future plans for expansion are capitalintensive and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equityrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund together with our principal sources of liquidity the costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required or at all If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them our financial condition results of operations business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected We may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment We depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives However product cycles or manufacturing technology may change periodically and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected Moreover improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment Alternatively as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our results of operations may be harmed We hold and may acquire digital assets that may be subject to volatile market prices impairment and unique risks of loss In January 2021 we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity allowing us to invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets gold bullion gold exchangetraded funds and other assets as specified in the future Thereafter we invested certain of such cash in bitcoin and also accepted bitcoin as a form of payment for sales of certain of our products in specified regions subject to applicable laws and suspended this practice in May 2021 We believe in the longterm potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiatbased cash and cash equivalent accounts we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and on our view of market and environmental conditions 22 The prices of digital assets have been in the past and may continue to be highly volatile including as a result of various associated risks and uncertainties For example the prevalence of such assets is a relatively recent trend and their longterm adoption by investors consumers and businesses is unpredictable Moreover their lack of a physical form their reliance on technology for their creation existence and transactional validation and their decentralization may subject their integrity to the threat of malicious attacks and technological obsolescence Finally the extent to which securities laws or other regulations apply or may apply in the future to such assets is unclear and may change in the future If we hold digital assets and their values decrease relative to our purchase prices our financial condition may be harmed Moreover digital assets are currently considered indefinitelived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules meaning that any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale which may adversely affect our operating results in any period in which such impairment occurs Moreover there is no guarantee that future changes in GAAP will not require us to change the way we account for digital assets held by us Finally as intangible assets without centralized issuers or governing bodies digital assets have been and may in the future be subject to security breaches cyberattacks or other malicious activities as well as human errors or computer malfunctions that may result in the loss or destruction of private keys needed to access such assets While we intend to take all reasonable measures to secure any digital assets if such threats are realized or the measures or controls we create or implement to secure our digital assets fail it could result in a partial or total misappropriation or loss of our digital assets and our financial condition and operating results may be harmed There is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not incur additional indebtedness As of December 31 2021 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 538 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see Note 11 Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Our consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions We and our subsidiaries may subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures If we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures selling assets refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time In addition our ability to make payments may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates We transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the US dollar currently primarily the Chinese yuan euro Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such foreign currencies any strengthening of the US dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in US dollars as we have historically experienced In addition a portion of our costs and expenses have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currencies including the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the US dollar depreciates significantly against these currencies our costs as measured in US dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins will suffer Moreover while we undertake limited hedging activities intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact As a result our operating results may be harmed We may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims which may be timeconsuming and expensive Our competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents copyrights trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our products and services which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business From time to time the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses andor may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights which could result in 23 substantial costs negative publicity and management attention regardless of merit While we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are strategic to our business or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by our competitors Accordingly we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses In addition if we are determined to have or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third partys intellectual property rights we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer to pay substantial damages andor license royalties to redesign our products and services andor to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services In the event that we are required to take one or more such actions our brand business financial condition and operating results may be harmed Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the Companys ESG practices may result in additional costs or risks Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their ESG practices Investor advocacy groups certain institutional investors investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the nonfinancial impacts of their investments While our mission is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy if our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations which continue to evolve we may incur additional costs and our brand ability to attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed Our operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control such as natural disasters wars or health epidemics We may be impacted by natural disasters wars health epidemics weather conditions the longterm effects of climate change power outages or other events outside of our control For example our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern California and Nevada and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a floodprone area Moreover the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is located experienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation If major disasters such as earthquakes floods or other climaterelated events occur or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products In addition the global COVID19 pandemic has impacted economic markets manufacturing operations supply chains employment and consumer behavior in nearly every geographic region and industry across the world and we have been and may in the future be adversely affected as a result We may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control which could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition Risks Related to Government Laws and Regulations Demand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of such products Government and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the US and abroad including certain tax exemptions tax credits and rebates may be reduced eliminated or exhausted from time to time For example previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in areas including Ontario Canada Germany Hong Kong Denmark and California have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted which may have negatively impacted sales Certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented that provide disproportionate benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla Any similar developments could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles and we and our customers may have to adjust to them In addition certain governmental rebates tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds However these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase sometimes without warning For example the US federal government currently offers certain tax credits for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a cosited solar power facility however these tax credits are currently scheduled to decline andor expire in 2023 and beyond Likewise in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use The benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results by making our products less competitive for customers 24 increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets Finally we and our fund investors claim these US federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems Some governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined that these values should be lower and they may do so again in the future Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences andor our obligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors We are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes upon our operations or products As we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions we are or will be subject to complex environmental manufacturing health and safety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the US China Germany and other locations abroad including laws relating to the use handling storage recycling disposal andor human exposure to hazardous materials product material inputs and postconsumer products and with respect to constructing expanding and maintaining our facilities New or changes in environmental and climate change laws regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance including remediations of any discovered issues and changes to our operations which may be significant and any failures to comply could result in significant expenses delays or fines In addition as we have increased our employee headcount and operations we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny including litigation and government investigations relating to allegations such as discrimination and workplace misconduct that we will need to defend against If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations it may harm our brand ability to attract and retain qualified employees business and financial condition We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply manufacture import sale and service of our products both domestically and abroad For example in countries outside of the US we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from requirements in the US thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in those countries This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements In particular we offer in our vehicles Autopilot and FSD Capability features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation We are continuing to develop our FSD Capability technology with the goal of achieving fully selfdriving capability in the future There are a variety of international federal and state regulations that may apply to the sale registration and operation of fully selfdriving vehicles which include many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not have a human driver Such regulations continue to rapidly change which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations or may delay products or restrict selfdriving features and their availability which could adversely affect our business Finally as a manufacturer installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems a supplier of electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers and a provider of grid services through virtual power plant models we are impacted by federal state and local regulations and policies concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third partyowned systems If regulations and policies that adversely impact the interconnection or use of our solar and energy storage systems are introduced they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant jurisdictions which may harm our business financial condition and operating results Any failure by us to comply with a variety of US and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us Any failure by us or our vendor or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigationrelated actions against us legal liability fines damages ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us In addition certain emerging privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation application and impact and may require extensive system and operational changes be difficult to implement increase our operating costs adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation For example the General Data Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union and has created new compliance obligations and significantly increased fines for noncompliance Similarly the California Consumer Privacy Act imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to California residents Finally new privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers personal information we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with data 25 breach requirements if for example third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to customers personal information A major breach of our network security and systems may result in fines penalties and damages and harm our brand prospects and operating results We could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain governmental investigations and proceedings We are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K To our knowledge no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred However we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC the US Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future Moreover we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas and if instituted in defending against any governmental proceedings For example on October 16 2018 the US District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the Court on September 29 2018 in connection with the actions taken by the SEC relating to Mr Musks statement on August 7 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private Pursuant to the settlement we among other things paid a civil penalty of 20 million appointed an independent director as the chair of our board of directors appointed two additional independent directors to our board of directors and made further enhancements to our disclosure controls and other corporate governancerelated matters On April 26 2019 this settlement was amended to clarify certain of the previouslyagreed disclosure procedures which was subsequently approved by the Court All other terms of the prior settlement were reaffirmed without modification Although we intend to continue to comply with the terms and requirements of the settlement if there is a lack of compliance or an alleged lack of compliance additional enforcement actions or other legal proceedings may be instituted against us We may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly While we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies including sales through our website we may not be able to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the US with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this directtoconsumer sales model It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and such assertions persist In certain locations decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been and may be challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers In some states there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that if enacted would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate The application of state laws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict Internationally there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our sales or other business practices Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed the laws in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intraday trading high of 124349 per share and a low of 53949 per share The stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies In particular a large proportion of our common stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in its market price Public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance In addition in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares securities class action litigation has been filed against us While we defend such actions vigorously any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources 26 Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors We expect our periodtoperiod financial results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we continue to design develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities may not be consistent or linear between periods Additionally our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products As a result of these factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our financial results especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance Moreover our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts ratings agencies or investors who may be focused only on shortterm quarterly financial results If any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business which could cause our stock price to decline We may provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance Correctly identifying key factors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes which generally are not linear throughout a given period average sales prices supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions If our guidance varies from actual results due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties the market value of our common stock could decline significantly Transactions relating to our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock The conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes issued by us or our subsidiaries would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes by their holders and we may be required to deliver a significant number of shares Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect their prevailing market prices In addition the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions or the anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock If Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations such sales could cause our stock price to decline Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk our Chief Executive Officer a portion of which was used to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to thirdparty participants in such offerings and placements We are not a party to these loans which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr Musk If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially Mr Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further Antitakeover provisions contained in our governing documents applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could impair a takeover attempt Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations In addition the terms of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change including a takeover of our company Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 27 ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES We are headquartered in Austin Texas Our principal facilities include a large number of properties in North America Europe and Asia utilized for manufacturing and assembly warehousing engineering retail and service locations Supercharger sites and administrative and sales offices Our facilities are used to support both of our reporting segments and are suitable and adequate for the conduct of our business We primarily lease such facilities with the exception of some manufacturing facilities The

material pending legal proceedings please see Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K In addition each of the matters below is being disclosed pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation SK because it relates to environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties that we currently believe could potentially exceed 1 million We believe that any proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition is likely to have potential penalties far in excess of such amount The German Umweltbundesamt has issued our subsidiary in Germany a notice and fine in the amount of 12 million euro alleging its noncompliance under applicable laws relating to market participation notifications and takeback obligations with respect to endoflife battery products required thereunder In response to Teslas objection the German Umweltbundesamt issued Tesla a revised fine notice dated April 29 2021 in which it reduced the original fine amount to 145 million euro This is primarily relating to administrative requirements but Tesla has continued to take back battery packs and although we cannot predict the outcome of this matter including the final amount of any penalties we filed a new objection in June 2021 and it is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business In April 2021 we received a notice from the Environmental Protection Agency the EPA alleging that Tesla failed to provide records demonstrating compliance with certain requirements under the applicable National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants under the Clean Air Act of 1963 as amended relating to Surface Coating of Automobiles and LightDuty Trucks regulations Tesla has responded to all information requests from the EPA and refutes the allegations Tesla continues to cooperate with the EPA in resolving this matter and it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business District attorneys in certain California counties are conducting an investigation into Teslas waste segregation practices pursuant to Cal Health Saf Code section 25100 et seq and Cal Civil Code 179880 Tesla has implemented various remedial measures including conducting training and audits and enhancements to its site waste management programs While the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable 28 PART II ITEM 5 MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS

financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2019related items refer to Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10K for fiscal year 2020 which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8 2021 Overview and 2021 Highlights Our mission is to accelerate the worlds transition to sustainable energy We design develop manufacture lease and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles solar energy generation systems and energy storage products We also offer maintenance installation operation financial and other services related to our products Additionally we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence robotics and automation In 2021 we produced 930422 vehicles and delivered 936222 vehicles We are currently focused on increasing vehicle production and capacity improving and developing battery technologies improving our FSD capabilities increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles and expanding our global infrastructure In 2021 we deployed 399 GWh of energy storage products and 345 megawatts of solar energy systems We are currently focused on ramping production of energy storage products improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency and increasing market share of retrofit and new build solar energy systems In 2021 we recognized total revenues of 5382 billion representing a 71 increase compared to the prior year We continue to ramp production build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products and further revenue growth In 2021 our net income attributable to common stockholders was 552 billion representing a favorable change of 480 billion compared to the prior year We continue to focus on improving our profitability through production and operational efficiencies We ended 2021 with 1758 billion in cash and cash equivalents representing a decrease of 181 billion from the end of 2020 Our cash flows provided by operating activities during 2021 was 1150 billion representing an increase of 555 billion compared to 594 billion during 2020 and capital expenditures amounted to 648 billion during 2021 compared to 316 billion during 2020 Sustained growth has allowed our business to generally fund itself but we will continue investing in a number of capitalintensive projects in upcoming periods Management Opportunities Challenges and Risks and 2022 Outlook Impact of COVID19 Pandemic Beginning in the first quarter of 2021 there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines against COVID19 as well as an easing of restrictions on social business travel and government activities and functions On the other hand infection rates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions and there are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic including challenges and increases in costs for logistics and supply chains such as increased port congestion intermittent supplier delays and a shortfall of semiconductor supply We have also previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments Ultimately we cannot predict the duration of the COVID19 pandemic We will continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production workforce and other resources accordingly 31 AutomotiveProduction The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10K Production Location Vehicle Models Production Status Fremont Factory Model S Model X Active Model 3 Model Y Active Gigafactory Shanghai Model 3 Model Y Active Gigafactory Berlin Model Y Equipment test Gigafactory Texas Model Y Equipment test Cybertruck In development TBD Tesla Semi In development TBD Tesla Roadster In development We are focused on ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing capacity at our current factories Our current production continues to be affected by the industrywide semiconductor and other component shortages requiring additional workaround manufacturing and production design solutions to be implemented which may be difficult to sustain Builds of Model Y in Gigafactory Texas and equipment testing through the vehicle production process in Gigafactory Berlin started in late 2021 The next phase of production growth will depend on the testing and ramp at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have highvolume output lower capital and production costs and longer range Consistent with our approach of innovating manufacturing techniques at our new factories we expect as well to pioneer new methods related to the mass production of these cells and our unique structural battery pack concept Our goals are to improve vehicle performance decrease production costs and increase affordability However these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations which may be exacerbated by the number of concurrent international projects any industrywide component constraints which may increase the number of manufacturing and production design workaround solutions required labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID19 pandemic Moreover we must meet ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory AutomotiveDemand and Sales Our cost reduction efforts and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles affordability and for example have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles in China In addition to ramping production in 2022 we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles performance and functionality including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot and FSD and other software features Moreover we expect to continue to benefit from a spike in demand in the automotive industry generally as well as ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and increasing environmental awareness However we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to trade environmental and political uncertainty all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the COVID19 pandemic Moreover as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation we will have to continue to execute well to maintain our momentum AutomotiveDeliveries and Customer Infrastructure As our deliveries increase we must work constantly to prevent our vehicle delivery capability from becoming a bottleneck on our total deliveries Increasing the exports of vehicles manufactured at Gigafactory Shanghai has been effective in mitigating the strain on our deliveries in markets outside of the United States and we expect to benefit further from situating additional factories closer to local markets As we expand our manufacturing operations globally we will have to continue to increase and staff our delivery servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction In particular we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations 32 Energy Generation and Storage Demand Production and Deployment The longterm success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes We continue to increase the production of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand including beginning construction of our Megafactory in Lathrop California but such production is also sensitive to global component constraints For Megapack energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones For Powerwall better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest and we are emphasizing crossselling with our residential solar energy products We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a lowcost and simplified online ordering experience In addition we continue to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof by onboarding and training new installers as well as collaborating with real estate developers and builders on new homes to reduce installation time and costs As these product lines grow we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel particularly skilled electricians to support the ramp of Solar Roof Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions We are simultaneously ramping new products in the new Model S and Model X Megapack and Solar Roof ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents and piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects the pace at which we meet milestones production adjustments to and among our various products increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth we currently expect our capital expenditures to be between 500 to 700 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years Our business has recently been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend and with better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding our sales growth is also facilitating positive cash generation On the other hand we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capitalintensive projects and rising material prices and increasing supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability associated with the COVID19 pandemic Moreover as our stock price has significantly increased we have seen higher levels of early conversions of inthemoney convertible senior notes which obligates us to deliver cash and or shares pursuant to the terms of those notes Overall we expect our ability to be selffunding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales Operating Expense Trends As long as we see expanding sales and excluding the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions including increased labor costs and impairment charges on certain assets as explained below we generally expect operating expenses relative to revenues to decrease as we continue to increase operational efficiency and process automation We expect operating expenses to grow in 2022 as we are expanding our operations globally In the first quarter of 2021 we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin We believe in the longterm potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiatbased cash and cashequivalent accounts we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions Digital assets are considered indefinitelived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules Accordingly any decrease in their fair values below our carrying values for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition will require us to recognize impairment charges whereas we may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale For any digital assets held now or in the future these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase For example in the year ended December 31 2021 we recorded approximately 101 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our bitcoin and gains of 128 million on certain sales of bitcoin by us Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US GAAP The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures We base our estimates on historical experience as appropriate and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period Accordingly actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our future financial statement presentation financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be affected 33 Due to the COVID19 pandemic there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets The estimates used for but not limited to determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements sales return reserves the collectability of accounts receivable inventory valuation fair value of longlived assets goodwill fair value of financial instruments fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10K These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions Revenue Recognition Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and payperuse charges and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606 including access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity FSD features and overtheair software updates We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the estimated useful life of the vehicle Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer For our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available At the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented In addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customers lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity FSD features and overtheair software updates As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option We offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners Under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value We recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicles estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customers economic incentive to exercise The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values On a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values 34 Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis In addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost We record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts If our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product Once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material writedowns may be required A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results Warranties We provide a manufacturers warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within Other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations Due to the magnitude of our automotive business accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment StockBased Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units RSUs granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan the ESPP to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards The fair value of stock option awards with only service andor performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the BlackScholes optionpricing model The BlackScholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP Stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period For performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable For performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of i the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize a cumulative catchup expense from the grant date to that point in time If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stockbased compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations As we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods Stockbased compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues Research and development expense and Selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 35 Income Taxes We are subject to taxes in the US and in many foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans Tax laws regulations and administrative practices may be subject to change due to economic or political conditions including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals The US many countries in the European Union and a number of other countries are actively considering changes in this regard As of December 31 2021 we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our net US deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our US deferred tax assets will not be realized Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted Furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions In the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain As a result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome These effects are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities We are required to file income tax returns in the US and various foreign jurisdictions which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authorities who may disagree with respect to our tax positions We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made 36 Results of Operations Revenues Year Ended December 31 2021 vs 2020 Change 2020 vs 2019

revenues related to cash deliveries of new Model S Model X Model 3 and Model Y vehicles including access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity FSD features and overtheair software updates Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting Automotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production sales and pricing negotiated with our customers We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting Additionally automotive leasing revenue includes direct salestype leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the salestype lease upon delivery to the customer Services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles retail merchandise sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue 2021 compared to 2020 Automotive sales revenue increased 1952 billion or 79 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 primarily due to an increase of 433815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix Additionally we had a 365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees which increased our automotive sales revenue due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021 respectively Automotive regulatory credits revenue decreased 115 million or 7 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions Automotive leasing revenue increased 590 million or 56 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct salestype leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020 These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined Services and other revenue increased 150 billion or 65 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles nonwarranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives 37 2021 compared to 2020 Energy generation and storage revenue increased by 795 million or 40 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in deployments of Megapack solar cash and loan jobs Powerwall and Solar Roof partially offset by a decrease in Powerpack deployments as we phase out the product following the introduction of Megapack Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin Year Ended

automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles cost of goods sold associated with direct salestype leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs Cost of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs costs for retail merchandise and costs to provide vehicle insurance Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers 2021 compared to 2020 Cost of automotive sales revenue increased 1272 billion or 65 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 primarily due to an increase of 433815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries Additionally the net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees resulted in a corresponding increase of 286 million in cost of automotive sales revenue These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 28819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at higher costs per unit due to temporary underutilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volumes during our current production ramp of the new versions of Model S and Model X Additionally there was a decrease in combined average Model 3 and Model Y costs per unit due to changes in regional production mix as Gigafactory Shanghai has ramped in capacity where costs are lower from localized procurement and manufacturing in China 38 Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased 415 million or 74 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct salestype leasing cost of revenues from more sales in the current year These increases were partially offset by the decrease in cost of automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined Cost of services and other revenue increased 124 billion or 46 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in volume and costs of nonTesla used vehicles costs to support our increase in nonwarranty maintenance services revenue and costs of retail merchandise as our sales have increased Gross margin for total automotive increased from 256 in the year ended December 31 2020 to 293 in the year ended December 31 2021 The increase was primarily due to favorable changes in sales and production mix of Model 3 and Model Y as Gigafactory Shanghai has ramped in capacity The average Model 3 and Model Y costs per unit have decreased significantly due to localized procurement and manufacturing in China despite rising raw material commodity logistics and expedite costs Additionally our Model Y gross margin has benefitted from shared manufacturing of Model 3 and learnings from the scaling of past products These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 115 million in sales of regulatory credits which have negligible incremental costs associated with them Gross margin for total automotive services and other segment increased from 224 in the year ended December 31 2020 to 269 in the year ended December 31 2021 primarily due to the automotive gross margin impacts discussed above and an improvement in our services and other gross margin Additionally there was a lower proportion of services and other which operated at a lower gross margin than our automotive business within the segment in the year ended December 31 2021 compared to the prior year Energy Generation and Storage Segment Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs where we are the lessor the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs 2021 compared to 2020 Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by 942 million or 48 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 primarily due to increases in deployments of Solar Roof solar cash and loan jobs Megapack and Powerwall partially offset by reductions in average costs per unit of Solar Roof as deployments have increased and a decrease in Powerpack deployments as we phase out the product following the introduction of Megapack Gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from 09 in the year ended December 31 2020 to 46 in the year ended December 31 2021 primarily due to a higher proportion of Solar Roof in our overall energy business which operated at a lower gross margin as a result of temporary manufacturing underutilization during product ramp despite an improvement in gross margin compared to the prior year and lower Powerpack gross margin as fixed cost absorptions are negatively impacted as we phase out the product following the introduction of Megapack These decreases were partially offset by a higher proportion of Powerwall in our overall energy business which operated at a higher gross margin as well as an increase in Megapack gross margin as we continue to scale the products Research and Development Expense Year Ended

freight and depreciation expense and an 103 million increase in stockbased compensation expense These increases were to support our expanding product roadmap such as the new versions of Model S and

SGA expenses increased 137 billion or 44 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 The increase is primarily due to an increase of 568 million in employee and labor related expenses from increased headcount and increased payroll taxes due to our higher average share price in the year ended December 31 2021 compared to the prior year Additionally there was 340 million of additional payroll tax due to our CEOs option exercises from the 2012 CEO Performance Award a 319 million increase in office information technology facilitiesrelated expenses sales and

Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity on January 1 2021 whereby we have derecognized the remaining debt discounts on the 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes and therefore no longer recognize any

will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates Other income expense net changed favorably by 257 million in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December

jurisdictions year over year Our effective tax rate decreased from 25 to 11 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 primarily due to growth in pretax income and changes in mix of jurisdictional earnings See Note 14 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K for further details Net Income

noncontrolling interests decreased by 16 million or 11 in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31 2020 Liquidity and Capital Resources We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last four fiscal years The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities such as the Fremont Factory Gigafactory Nevada Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory New York the construction and ramp of Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas and the continued expansion of our retail and service locations body shops Mobile Service fleet Supercharger network and energy product installation capabilities In addition because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment For example if our nearterm manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected including due to global economic or business conditions we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures Finally we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds Conversely we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early Accordingly we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12month period following December 31 2021 as well as in the longterm 41 See the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such needs Material Cash Requirements From time to time in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to be used in the manufacture of our products However due to contractual terms variability in the precise growth curves of our development and production ramps and opportunities to renegotiate pricing we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts beyond the short term and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsManagement Opportunities Challenges and Risks and 2022 OutlookCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this Annual Report on Form 10K we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to be between 500 to 700 billion in 2022 and each of the next two fiscal years In connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York we have an agreement to spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31 2029 pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in April 2021 and which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in August 2021 We also have an operating lease arrangement with the local government of Shanghai pursuant to which we are required to spend RMB 1408 billion in capital expenditures at Gigafactory Shanghai by the end of 2023 For details regarding these obligations refer to Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K As of December 31 2021 we and our subsidiaries had outstanding 538 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness of which 109 billion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months As of December 31 2021 our total minimum lease payments are 403 billion of which 104 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations refer to Note 11 Debt and Note 12 Leases to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K Sources and Conditions of Liquidity Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles sales and installations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings when applicable As of December 31 2021 we had 1758 billion of cash and cash equivalents Balances held in foreign currencies had a US dollar equivalent of 722 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan euros and Canadian dollars In addition we had 111 billion of unused committed amounts under our credit facilities as of December 31 2021 Certain of such unused committed amounts are subject to satisfying specified conditions prior to drawdown such as pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables inventories leased vehicles and our interests in those leases solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts or various other assets For details regarding our indebtedness refer to Note 11 Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K We continue adapting our investment strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives such as investing in US government and other marketable securities digital assets and providing product related financing In the first quarter of 2021 we invested an aggregate 150 billion in bitcoin The fair market value of our bitcoin holdings as of December 31 2021 was 199 billion We believe in the longterm potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash As with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiatbased cash and cash equivalent accounts we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions However digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices which may be unfavorable at the times when we may want or need to liquidate them Additionally we held shortterm marketable securities of 131 million as of December 31 2021 42 Summary of Cash Flows Year Ended December 31 Dollars in millions 2021 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities 11497 5943 2405 Net cash used in investing activities 7868 3132 1436 Net cash used in provided by financing activities 5203 9973 1529 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling general and administrative and working capital Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and related servicing customer lease payments customer deposits cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage products These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process operating expenses operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 555 billion to 1150 billion during the year ended December 31 2021 from 594 billion during the year ended December 31 2020 This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income excluding noncash expenses and gains of 522 billion and the overall decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of 334 million The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was mainly driven by a larger increase of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to the prior year from ramp up in production at Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by larger increases of inventory and operating lease vehicles compared to the prior year Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures which were 648 billion for the year ended December 31 2021 and 316 billion for the year ended December 31 2020 mainly for the construction of Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory Berlin and the expansions of Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory Additionally net cash outflows related to digital assets were 123 billion in the year ended December 31 2021 from purchases of digital assets for 150 billion offset by proceeds from sales of digital assets of 272 million Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash outflows from financing activities were 520 billion during the year ended December 31 2021 compared to 997 billion net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31 2020 The change was primarily due to no equity offerings in 2021 compared to 1227 billion of proceeds from issuances of common stock net of issuance costs in 2020 a 337 billion increase in net repayments of convertible and other debt compared to the prior year offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options and other stock issuances of 290 million and a decrease in collateralized lease repayments of 231 million compared to the prior year See Note 11 Debt to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K for further details regarding our debt obligations Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Risk We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue costs of revenue operating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the US dollar primarily the Chinese yuan euro Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone in relation to our current year operations In general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the US dollar for our foreign subsidiaries Accordingly changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in US dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains losses on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances 43 We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the nearterm These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income before income taxes These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of 277 million at December 31 2021 and 8 million at December 31 2020 assuming no foreign currency hedging Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates Pursuant to our risk management policies in certain cases we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates on our floating rate debt would have increased or decreased our interest expense for the years ended December 31 2021 and 2020 by 2 million and 4 million respectively 44 ITEM 8 FINANCIAL STATEME NTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Page Report of

companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements Because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that i relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and ii involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial

relates Automotive Warranty Reserve As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements total accrued warranty which primarily relates to the automotive segment was 2101 million as of December 31 2021 The Company provides a manufacturers warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles A warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold which includes managements best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty including recalls if identified These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve this in turn led to significant auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate the estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge 47 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements estimate of the automotive warranty reserve including controls over managements estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date These procedures also included among others testing managements process for determining the automotive warranty reserve This included evaluating the appropriateness of the model applied and the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty Evaluating the assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering current and past performance including a lookback analysis comparing prior period forecasted claims to actual claims incurred These procedures also included developing an independent estimate of a portion of the automotive warranty reserve and comparing the independent estimate to managements estimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate and testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and that such claims were appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in developing an independent estimate of a portion of the automotive warranty reserve and in evaluating the appropriateness of certain aspects of managements model for estimating the nature and frequency of future claims s PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose California February 4 2022 We have served as the Companys auditor since 2005 48 Tesla Inc C onsolidated Balance Sheets in millions except per

financial statements 53 Tesla Inc N otes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Overview Tesla Inc Tesla the Company we us or our was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1 2003 We design develop manufacture and sell highperformance fully electric vehicles and design manufacture install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage products Our Chief Executive Officer as the chief operating decision maker CODM organizes our company manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments i automotive and ii energy generation and storage There has continued to be widespread impact from the coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic Beginning in the first quarter of 2021 there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines against COVID19 as well as an easing of restrictions on social business travel and government activities and functions On the other hand infection rates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions and there are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic including challenges and increases in costs for logistics and supply chains such as increased port congestion intermittent supplier delays and a shortfall of semiconductor supply We have also previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest In accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 810 Consolidation we consolidate any variable interest entity VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity however a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities such as VIEs through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs see Note 16 Variable Interest Entity Arrangements We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes Due to the COVID19 pandemic there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets which could impact our estimates and assumptions We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10K These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions Reclassifications Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 54 Revenue Recognition Revenue by source The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source in millions Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Automotive sales without resale value guarantee 43186 24053 19212 Automotive sales with resale value guarantee 1 939 551 146 Automotive regulatory credits 1465 1580 594 Energy generation and storage sales 2279 1477 1000 Services and other 3802 2306 2226 Total revenues from sales and services 51671 29967 23178 Automotive leasing 1642 1052 869 Energy generation and storage leasing 510 517 531 Total revenues 53823 31536 24578 1 Pricing adjustments on our vehicle offerings can impact the estimate of likelihood that customers would exercise their resale value guarantees resulting in an adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees Actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of our reserve of 365 million which represented an increase in automotive sales revenue For the years ended December 31 2020 and 2019 vehicle pricing reductions resulted in an increase of our reserve of 72 million and 555 million respectively which represented decreases in automotive sales revenue Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Revenue Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles and payperuse charges and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606 including access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity Full Self Driving FSD features and overtheair software updates We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of a vehicle transfers Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity and overtheair software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straightline basis as we have a standready obligation to deliver such services to the customer We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period which is generally the estimated useful life of the vehicle Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer For our obligations related to automotive sales we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service thirdparty pricing of similar options and other information that may be available At the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record a sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product returns Such return rate estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented In addition any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customers lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles Commissions are not paid on other obligations such as access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity FSD features and overtheair software updates As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option We offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms to certain international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles through one of our specified commercial banking partners We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing partners Under these programs we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for a predetermined resale value 55 We recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception The process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a vehicles estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customers economic incentive to exercise The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return reserve Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values On a quarterly basis we assess the estimated market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change there may be material changes to their estimated values Due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles during 2021 we estimated that there is a lower future likelihood that customers will exercise their resale value guarantees We adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees resulting in an increase of automotive sales revenues of 365 million for the year ended December 31 2021 and a corresponding increase in cost of automotive sales of 286 million The net benefit in gross profit was 79 million for the year ended December 31 2021 The total sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees was 223 million and 703 million as of December 31 2021 and December 31 2020 respectively of which 91 million and 202 million was short term respectively Deferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network internet connectivity FSD features and overtheair software updates on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the following in millions Year ended December 31 2021 2020 Deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee beginning of period 1926 1472 Additions 847 724 Net changes in liability for preexisting contracts 25 56 Revenue recognized 366 326 Deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee end of period 2382 1926 Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the balance sheet date Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31 2020 and 2019 was 312 million and 283 million for the years ended December 31 2021 and 2020 respectively Of the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees as of December 31 2021 we expect to recognize 962 million of revenue in the next 12 months The remaining balance will be recognized over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee Automotive Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to zeroemission vehicles greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuel We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits which have negligible incremental costs associated with them at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party Revenue from the sale of automotive regulatory credits totaled 146 billion 158 billion and 594 million for the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was immaterial as of December 31 2021 and 2020 respectively Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31 2020 and 2019 was immaterial and 140 million for the years ended December 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 56 Automotive Leasing Revenue Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the US Canada and in certain countries in Europe Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months At the end of the lease term customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for Model S and Model X in certain regions may opt to purchase the vehicles for a predetermined residual value We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straightline basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue For the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we recognized 125 billion 752 million and 532 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue respectively As of December 31 2021 and 2020 we had deferred 392 million and 293 million respectively of leaserelated upfront payments which will be recognized on a straightline basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts Direct SalesType Leasing Program We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as salestype leases under ASC 842 in certain countries in Asia and Europe which we introduced during the third quarter of 2020 Depending on the specific program customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term If the customer does not have a right to return the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments Under the programs for which there is a right to return the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly under these programs for up to 48 months Our loan arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the salestype lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue respectively upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis For the years ended December 31 2021 and 2020 we recognized 369 million and 120 million respectively of salestype leasing revenue and 234 million and 87 million respectively of salestype leasing cost of revenue Services and Other Revenue Services and other revenue consists of nonwarranty aftersales vehicle services sales of used vehicles retail merchandise sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a standready obligation to the customer We sell used vehicles services service plans vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations Payment for used vehicles services and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets Deferred revenue related to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31 2021 and 2020 57 Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential small commercial large commercial and utility grade customers Energy generation and storage sales revenue also includes revenue from agreements for solar energy systems and power purchase agreements PPAs that commence after January 1 2019 which is recognized as earned based on the amount of capacity provided for solar energy systems or electricity delivered for PPAs at the contractual billing rates assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met Under the practical expedient available under ASC 606105518 we recognize revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering design and installation of the system Postinstallation residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and commissioned Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contractspecific phases of a project Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales Certain largescale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply revenue is recognized when control transfers which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sales Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy performance requirements specified in the contract In certain instances we may receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level Conversely if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements we may be required to pay liquidated damages Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur 58 We record as deferred revenue any nonrefundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service and operations and maintenance service which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term As of December 31 2021 and 2020 deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to 399 million and 187 million respectively Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31 2020 and 2019 was 93 million and 34 million for the years ended December 31 2021 and 2020 respectively We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date As of December 31 2021 total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was 152 million Of this amount we expect to recognize 9 million in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up to 26 years Energy Generation and Storage Leasing For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products we record lease revenue from minimum lease payments including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems on a straightline basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1 2019 we have determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840 Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers including lease prepayments in excess of revenue recognized and operations and maintenance service fees which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term As of December 31 2021 and 2020 deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to 198 million and 206 million respectively Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies which is recognized as revenue over the lease term As of December 31 2021 and 2020 deferred revenue from rebates and incentives amounted to 27 million and 29 million respectively We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs which include the referral fees and sales commissions as an element of solar energy systems net and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements Cost of Revenues Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials labor costs manufacturing overhead including depreciation costs of tooling and machinery shipping and logistic costs vehicle connectivity costs allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand Automotive Leasing Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles cost of goods sold associated with direct salestype leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs Services and Other Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing nonwarranty aftersales services cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs costs for retail merchandise and costs to provide vehicle insurance Cost of services and other revenue also includes direct parts material and labor costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers 59 Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and onhand inventory in excess of forecasted demand In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs Leases We adopted ASC 842 Leases as of January 1 2019 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach adoption of the new lease standard In addition we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard which allowed us to carry forward the historical determination of contracts as leases lease classification and not reassess initial direct costs for historical lease arrangements The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840 Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred Marketing Promotional and Advertising Costs Marketing promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations Marketing promotional and advertising costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 Income Taxes Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA subjects a US shareholder to tax on global intangible lowtaxed income GILTI earned by certain foreign subsidiaries Under GAAP we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes We elected the deferred method under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets currently subject to valuation allowance Comprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss Other comprehensive income loss consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on marketable securities that have been excluded from the determination of net income loss StockBased Compensation We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units RSUs granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase plan the ESPP to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased awards The fair value of stock option awards with only service andor performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the BlackScholes optionpricing model The BlackScholes optionpricing model requires inputs such as the riskfree interest rate expected term and expected volatility These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards usually the vesting period which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP Stockbased compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis net of actual forfeitures in the period 60 For performancebased awards stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable For performancebased awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions stockbased compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer of i the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such tranche and ii the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being achieved If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant date we will recognize a cumulative catchup expense from the grant date to that point in time If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone then the stockbased compensation expense will be recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations As we accumulate additional employee stockbased awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives which could materially impact the valuation of our stockbased awards and the stockbased compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods Stockbased compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues Research and development expense and Selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent thirdparty interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements or funds that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profitsharing arrangements We have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profitsharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value HLBV method We therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries Under the HLBV method the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third parties The third parties interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties However the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets For certain funds there may be significant fluctuations in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes in the liquidation provisions as timebased milestones are reached Net Income Loss per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders Basic net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income loss attributable to common stockholders by the weightedaverage shares of common stock outstanding for the period Potentially dilutive shares which are based on the weightedaverage shares of common stock underlying outstanding stockbased awards warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the ifconverted method as applicable are included when calculating diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive On January 1 2021 we adopted ASU 202006 using the modified retrospective method Following this adoption we utilize the ifconverted method for diluted net income per share calculation of our convertible debt instruments see Recent Accounting Pronouncements section below for further details During the year ended December 31 2021 we increased net income loss attributable to common stockholders by 9 million to arrive at the numerator used to calculate diluted net income per share which represents the interest expense recognized on the convertible debt instruments that were subject to this change in methodology Prior to the adoption we applied the treasury stock method when calculating the potential dilutive effect if any of the following convertible senior notes which we intended to settle or have settled in cash the principal outstanding Furthermore in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants see Note 11 Debt However our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always antidilutive The strike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the period and were in the money and included in the tables below Warrants have been included in the weightedaverage shares used in computing basic net income loss per share of common stock in the periods they are settled 61 The following table presents the reconciliation of net income loss attributable to common stockholders to net income loss used in computing basic and diluted net income loss per share of common stock in millions Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Net

notes 1 1 5 1 Under the modified retrospective method of adoption of ASU 202006 the dilutive impact of convertible senior notes was calculated using the ifconverted method for the year ended December 31 2021 Certain convertible senior notes were calculated using the treasury stock method for the years ended December 31 2020 and 2019 Refer to discussion above for further details Business Combinations We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805 Business Combinations The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred Identifiable assets including intangible assets liabilities assumed including contingent liabilities and noncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed We recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents Our cash equivalents are primarily comprised of money market funds 62 Restricted Cash We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities In addition restricted cash includes cash held as collateral for certain permits as well as sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee letters of credit real estate leases insurance policies certain operating leases and cash received from certain fund investors that have not been released for use by us We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and determine current or noncurrent classification based on the expected duration of the restriction Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows was as follows in millions December 31 December 31 December 31 2021 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents 17576 19384 6268 Restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 345 238 246 Restricted cash included in other noncurrent assets 223 279 269 Total as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 18144 19901 6783 Marketable Securities Marketable securities may be comprised of a combination of US government securities and corporate debt securities and are all designated as availableforsale and reported at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included within stockholders equity Availableforsale marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in shortterm marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet Interest dividends amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on our marketable securities are included in other income expense net The cost of availableforsale marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method Realized gains and losses on the sale of availableforsale marketable securities are recorded in other income expense net We regularly review all of our marketable securities for declines in fair value The review includes but is not limited to i the consideration of the cause of the decline ii any currently recorded expected credit losses and iii the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers The amortized cost basis of our marketable securities approximates its fair value Accoun ts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers sales of energy generation and storage products sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers government rebates already passed through to customers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible We writeoff accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits which are typically transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter is dependent on contractual payment terms Additionally government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period As of December 31 2021 and 2020 we had 627 million and 46 million respectively of longterm government rebates receivable in Other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets 63 MyPower Customer Notes Receivable We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30 year loan The outstanding balances net of any allowance for expected credit losses are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other noncurrent assets for the longterm portion In determining expected credit losses we consider our historical level of credit losses current economic trends and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows As of December 31 2021 and 2020 the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable net of allowance for expected credit losses was 299 million and 334 million respectively of which 11 million and 9 million were due in the next 12 months as of December 31 2021 and 2020 respectively As of December 31 2021 and 2020 the allowance for expected credit losses was 41 million and 45 million respectively Concentration of Risk Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted cash accounts receivable convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the US These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits As of December 31 2021 and 2020 no entity represented 10 or more of our total accounts receivable balance The risk of concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highlyrated multinational banks Supply Risk We are dependent on our suppliers including single source suppliers and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices quality levels and volumes acceptable to us or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products which approximates actual cost on a firstin firstout basis In addition cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost We record inventory writedowns for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts If our inventory onhand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amounts are writtenoff We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory onhand into a finished product Once inventory is writtendown a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change additional and potentially material writedowns may be required A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results Operating Lease Vehicles Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation We generally depreciate their cost less residual value using the straightlinemethod to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31 2021 and 2020 was 528 billion and 354 billion respectively Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of 773 million and 446 million as of December 31 2021 and 2020 respectively Digital Assets Net During the year ended December 31 2021 we purchased an aggregate of 150 billion in bitcoin a digital asset and briefly accepted bitcoin as a payment for sales of certain of our products in specified regions subject to applicable laws We account for such noncash consideration at the time we enter into transactions with our customers in accordance with the noncash consideration guidance included in the Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers based on the then current quoted market prices of the digital assets 64 We currently account for all digital assets held as a result of these transactions as indefinitelived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350 IntangiblesGoodwill and Other We have ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use thirdparty custodial services to secure it The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition We determine the fair value of our digital assets on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement based on quoted prices on the active exchanges that we have determined is the principal market for such assets Level 1 inputs We perform an analysis each quarter to identify whether events or changes in circumstances principally decreases in the quoted prices on active exchanges indicate that it is more likely than not that our digital assets are impaired In determining if an impairment has occurred we consider the lowest market price of one unit of digital asset quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset If the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair value so determined an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the price determined Impairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment is identified The impaired digital assets are written down to their fair value at the time of impairment and this new cost basis will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increase in fair value Gains are not recorded until realized upon sales at which point they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held within Restructuring and other In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale See Note 3 Digital Assets Net for further information regarding digital assets Solar Energy Systems Net We are the lessor of solar energy systems Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows Solar energy systems in service 30 to 35 years Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs Lease term up to 25 years Solar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they have been interconnected and placed inservice Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation which will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they are completed interconnected and placed in service Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements Property Plant and Equipment Net Property plant and equipment net including leasehold improvements are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation Depreciation is generally computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows Machinery equipment vehicles and office furniture 3 to 15 years Tooling 4 to 7 years Building and building improvements 15 to 30 years Computer equipment and software 3 to 10 years Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straightline basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases Upon the retirement or sale of our property plant and equipment the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction Capitalized interest on construction in progress is included within Property plant and equipment net and is amortized over the life of the related assets 65 LongLived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets We review our property plant and equipment solar energy systems longterm prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate If the asset is not recoverable its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its fair value For the years ended December 31 2021 and 2020 we have recognized no material impairments of our longlived assets For the year ended December 31 2019 we have recognized certain impairments of our longlived assets refer to Note 19 Restructuring and Other for further details Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives which range from three to thirty years Goodwill We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired by comparing its carrying value to the reporting units fair value For the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we did no t recognized any impairment of goodwill Capitalization of Software Costs We capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software during the application development stage to Property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheets Costs related to preliminary project activities and postimplementation activities are expensed as incurred Such costs are amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life of three years S oftware development costs incurred in development of software to be sold leased or otherwise marketed incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are expected to become significant Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made generally available to our customers We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets For the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we have recognized no material impairments of capitalized software costs Foreign Currency We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in which they operate In cases where the functional currency is not the US dollar we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet For each subsidiary we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the monthend functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations For the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of 97 million loss of 114 million and gain of 48 million respectively 66 Warranties We provide a manufacturers warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and costs of future claims These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is included within Other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations Due to the magnitude of our automotive business accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following in millions Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Accrued warrantybeginning of period 1468 1089 748 Warranty costs incurred 525 312 250 Net changes in liability for preexisting warranties including expirations and foreign exchange impact 102 66 36 Provision for warranty 1056 625 555 Accrued warrantyend of period 2101 1468 1089 Customer Deposits Customer deposits primarily consist of cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an energy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation including the fair values of any customer tradein vehicles that are applicable toward a new vehicle purchase Customer deposits also include prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties such as vehicle maintenance plans Customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle model the energy product and the country of delivery With the exception of a nominal order fee customer deposits are fully refundable on vehicles prior to delivery and fully refundable in the case of an energy generation or storage product prior to the entry into a purchase agreement or in certain cases for a limited time thereafter in accordance with applicable laws Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded forfeited or applied towards the customers purchase balance Solar Renewable Energy Credits We account for Solar Renewable Energy Certificates SRECs when they are purchased by us or sold to third parties For SRECs generated by solar energy systems owned by us and minted by government agencies we do not recognize any specifically identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental costs incurred to generate the SRECs We recognize revenue within the energy generation and storage segment from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer and the cost of the SREC if any is then recorded to energy generation and storage cost of revenue Nevada Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to 195 million in consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada These incentives are available until June 2024 or June 2034 depending on the incentive As of December 31 2021 and 2020 we had earned the maximum of 195 million of transferable tax credits under these agreements Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas we entered into a 20 year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive grant funding equal to 70 80 of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10 year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount in each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas As of December 31 2021 we had no t yet received any grant funding related to property taxes paid to Travis County 67 Defined Contribution Plan We have a 401k savings plan in the US that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code and a number of savings plans internationally Under the 401k savings plan participating employees may elect to contribute up to 90 of their eligible compensation subject to certain limitations We did no t make any contributions to the 401k savings plan during the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 other than employee deferrals of eligible compensation Beginning in January 2022 we will match 50 of each employees contributions up to a maximum of 6 capped at 3000 of the employees eligible compensation vested upon one year of service Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted In October 2021 the FASB issued ASU No 202108 Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers Topic 805 This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities deferred revenue from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606 At the acquisition date the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15 2022 including interim periods within those fiscal years Adoption of the ASU should be applied prospectively Early adoption is also permitted including adoption in an interim period If early adopted the amendments are applied retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurred during the fiscal year of adoption This ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements In November 2021 the FASB issued ASU No 202110 Government Assistance Topic 832 This ASU requires business entities to disclose information about government assistance they receive if the transactions were accounted for by analogy to either a grant or a contribution accounting model The disclosure requirements include the nature of the transaction and the related accounting policy used the line items on the balance sheets and statements of operations that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item and the significant terms and conditions of the transactions The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15 2021 The disclosure requirements can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all transactions in the scope of the amendments that are reflected in the financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are entered into after the date of initial application The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements Recently adopted accounting pronouncements In December 2019 the FASB issued ASU No 201912 Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards The amendments in the ASU include removing exceptions to incremental intraperiod tax allocation of losses and gains from different financial statement components exceptions to the method of recognizing income taxes on interim period losses and exceptions to deferred tax liability recognition related to foreign subsidiary investments In addition the ASU requires that entities recognize franchise tax based on an incremental method and requires an entity to evaluate the accounting for stepups in the tax basis of goodwill as inside or outside of a business combination We adopted ASU 201912 starting 2021 which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements In March 2020 the FASB issued ASU No 202004 Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting Topic 848 The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate eg LIBOR reform if certain criteria are met for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting The ASU is effective as of March 12 2020 through December 31 2022 We continue to evaluate transactions or contract modifications occurring as a result of reference rate reform and determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis We adopted ASU 202004 during 2021 The ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements In May 2021 the FASB issued ASU No 202104 Issuers Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding EquityClassified Written Call Options The ASU addresses the previous lack of specific guidance in the accounting standards codification related to modifications or exchanges of freestanding equityclassified written call options such as warrants by specifying the accounting for various modification scenarios The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2021 with early adoption permitted for any periods after issuance to be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period We adopted the ASU during 2021 as of the beginning of our fiscal year which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 68 ASU 202006 In August 2020 the FASB issued ASU 202006 Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 47020 DebtDebt with Conversion and Other Options for convertible instruments The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paidin capital such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835 Interest Further the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the ifconverted method for diluted EPS calculation and no longer allowing the net share settlement method The ASU also made revisions to Topic 81540 which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting The amendments to Topic 81540 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15 2021 with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15 2020 Adoption of the ASU can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis On January 1 2021 we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method We recognized a cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit Due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes mezzanine equity were reduced The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt balance and the reduction of property plant and equipment was related to previously capitalized interest The prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods Accordingly the cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1 2021 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the ASU was as follows in millions Balances at December 31 2020 Adjustments from Adoption of ASU 202006 Balances at January 1 2021 Assets Property plant and equipment net 12747 45 12702 Liabilities Current portion of debt and finance leases 2132 50 2182 Debt and finance leases net of

consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31 2021 was primarily to decrease net interest expense by 204 million and to decrease depreciation expense by immaterial amounts This had the effect of increasing our basic and diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders by 022 and 020 respectively for the year ended December 31 2021 The change in methodology to determine the denominator used in the calculation of diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders contributed less than 001 of the increase by requiring the use of the ifconverted method as discussed above for the year ended December 31 2021 Note 3 Digital Assets Net During the year ended December 31 2021 we purchased and received 150 billion of bitcoin During the year ended December 31 2021 we recorded 101 million of impairment losses on such digital assets We also realized gains of 128 million in connection with selling a portion of our holdings in March 2021 Such gains are presented net of impairment losses in Restructuring and other in the consolidated statement of operations As of December 31 2021 the carrying value of our digital assets held was 126 billion which reflects cumulative impairments of 101 million The fair market value of such digital assets held as of December 31 2021 was 199 billion 69 Note 4 Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill decreased 7 million within the automotive segment from 207 million as of December 31 2020 to 200 million as of December 31 2021 There were no accumulated impairment losses

participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability The threetiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value is comprised of Level I observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets Level II inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and Level III unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows in millions December 31 2021 December 31 2020 Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Fair Value Level I Level II Level III Money market funds cash and cash

of direct salestype leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements From a lessor perspective the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the nonlease components and associated lease component and the lease component if accounted for separately would be classified as an operating lease We have elected not to present shortterm leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments Our leases where we are the lessee often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years Some of our leases also include options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term For purposes of calculating lease liabilities lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate We calculate the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases commencing after January 1 2019 For historical leases we used the index or rate as of January 1 2019 Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term in interest expense The balances

December 31 2021 our CEO exercised all of the remaining vested options from the 2012 CEO Performance Award which amounted to an intrinsic value of 2345 billion ESPP Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15 of their eligible compensation subject to any plan limitations The purchase price would be 85 of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of each sixmonth offering period During the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we issued 05 million 18 million and 25 million shares under the ESPP There were 338 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31 2021 Fair Value Assumptions We use the fair value method in recognizing stockbased compensation expense Under the fair value method we estimate the fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the BlackScholes option pricing model The weightedaverage assumptions used in the BlackScholes model for stock options are as follows Year Ended December 31 2021 2020 2019 Riskfree interest rate 066 026 24 Expected term in years 43 39 45 Expected volatility 59 69 48 Dividend yield 00 00 00 Grant date fair value per share 38407 21614 2232 82 The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock The riskfree interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield for zerocoupon US Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grants expected life We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock 2018 CEO Performance Award In March 2018 our stockholders approved the Board of Directors grant of 1013 million stock option awards as adjusted to give effect to the fiveforone stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020 Stock Split to our CEO the 2018 CEO Performance Award The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both i the market capitalization milestone for such tranche which begins at 1000 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of 500 billion thereafter based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average counting only trading days has been achieved and ii any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms 10Q andor 10K Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income loss attributable to common stockholders before interest expense provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation Upon vesting and exercise including the payment of the exercise price of 7001 per share our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years postexercise other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding The achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31 2021 is provided below Although an operational milestone is deemed achieved in the last quarter of the relevant annualized period it may be certified only after the financial statements supporting its achievement have been filed with our Forms 10Q andor 10K Total Annualized Revenue Annualized Adjusted EBITDA

compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represents a noncash expense and is recorded as a Selling general and administrative operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations In each quarter since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award we have recognized expense generally on a prorated basis for only the number of tranches up to the maximum of 12 tranches that corresponds to the number of operational milestones that have been achieved or have been determined probable of being achieved in the future in accordance with the following principles 83 On the grant date a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each tranche i a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and ii the future time when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved or its expected market capitalization milestone achievement time Separately based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance each quarter we determine whether it is probable that we will achieve each operational milestone that has not previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement and if so the future time when we expect to achieve that operational milestone or its expected operational milestone achievement time When we first determine that an operational milestone has become probable of being achieved we allocate the entire expense for the related tranche over the number of quarters between the grant date and the thenapplicable expected full achievement time The expected full achievement time at any given time is the later of i the expected operational milestone achievement time if the related operational milestone has not yet been achieved and ii the expected market capitalization milestone achievement time if the related market capitalization milestone had not yet been achieved We immediately recognize a catchup expense for all accumulated expense for the quarters from the grant date through the quarter in which the operational milestone was first deemed probable of being achieved Each quarter thereafter we recognize the prorated portion of the thenremaining expense for the tranche based on the number of quarters between such quarter and the thenapplicable expected full achievement time except that upon the achievement of both a market capitalization milestone and operational milestone with respect to a tranche all remaining expense for that tranche is immediately recognized As a result we have experienced significant catchup expenses in quarters when one or more operational milestones were first determined to be probable of achievement Historically the expected market capitalization achievement times were generally later than the related expected operational milestone achievement times Therefore when market capitalization milestones were achieved earlier than originally forecasted due to periods of rapid stock price appreciation we had higher catchup expenses and the remaining expenses were being recognized over shorter periods of time at a higher perquarter rate All market capitalization milestones were achieved as of the second quarter of 2021 During the year ended December 31 2021 five operational milestones became probable of achievement and consequently we recognized an aggregate catchup expense of 571 million As of December 31 2021 we had 65 million of total unrecognized stockbased compensation expense remaining which will be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 06 years For the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we recorded stockbased compensation expense of 910 million 838 million and 296 million respectively related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award Other PerformanceBased Grants 2012 CEO Performance Award In August 2012 our Board of Directors granted 264 million stock option awards to our CEO the 2012 CEO Performance Award as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split The 2012 CEO Performance Award consists of 10 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date During the year ended December 31 2021 our CEO exercised all of the remaining 229 million vested options from the 2012 CEO Performance Award As of December 31 2021 the performance milestone of gross margin of 30 or more for four consecutive quarters was considered not probable of achievement for which the unrecognized stockbased compensation is immaterial For the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we did no t record any stockbased compensation expense related to the 2012 CEO Performance Award 2014 PerformanceBased Stock Option Awards In 2014 to create incentives for continued longterm success beyond the Model S program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders interests in the achievement of significant milestones by us the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted stock option awards to certain employees excluding our CEO to purchase an aggregate of 54 million shares of our common stock as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split Each award consisted of four vesting tranches with the vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the future performance milestones assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date As of December 31 2021 the performance milestone of annualized gross margin of greater than 30 for any threeyear period was considered not probable of achievement for which the unrecognized stockbased compensation is immaterial For the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we did no t record any stockbased compensation expense related to this grant 84 2021 PerformanceBased Stock Option RSU Awards During the fourth quarter of 2021 the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted to certain employees restricted stock units and stock options to purchase an aggregate 07 million shares of our common stock to create incentives for continued longterm success and to closely align compensation with our stockholders interests in the achievement of certain performance milestones by our company We begin recording stockbased compensation expense when the performance milestones become probable of achievement Following achievement vesting occurs over a two year period with continued employment As of December 31 2021 we had unrecognized stockbased compensation expense of 413 million f or this grant as it was not considered probable of achievement For the year ended December 31

weightedaverage period of 210 years 85 Note 14 Income Taxes A provision for income taxes of 699 million 292 million and 110 million has been recognized for the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and

deferred tax liabilities 1941 2102 Deferred tax assets liabilities net of valuation allowance 65 84 86 As of December 31 2021 we recorded a valuation allowance of 907 billion for the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by 614 billion 974 million and 150 million during the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to additional US deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective year We have 417 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions which management believes are morelikelythannot to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions We did not have any material releases of valuation allowance for the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 We continue to monitor the realizability of the US deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors In completing this assessment we considered both objective and subjective factors These factors included but were not limited to a history of losses in prior years excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation future reversal of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies After evaluating all available evidence we intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our US deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances Given the improvement in our operating results and depending on the amount of stockbased compensation tax deductions available in the future we may release the valuation allowance associated with the US deferred tax assets in the next few years Release of all or a portion of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded The reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 was as follows in millions Year Ended December 31 2021 2020

billion of federal and 216 billion of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income some of which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2022 for federal and state purposes A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity and some of the companies we acquired and therefore are subject to change of control provisions which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year We do not expect the change of control limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes Our 2021 net operating loss included corporate income tax deductions related to our CEOs exercise of the remaining stock options from the 2012 CEO Performance Award which resulted in a 2345 billion tax deduction Such increase in net operating loss is included in our deferred income tax assets offset by a valuation allowance Section 162m of the Internal Revenue Code was amended for deductibility of executive compensation for stock grants after 2017 Therefore we are not expecting substantial corporate income tax deductions from our CEOs subsequent option exercises As of December 31 2021 we had research and development tax credits of 738 million and 584 million for federal and state income tax purposes respectively If not utilized the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024 However the state of California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely In addition we have other general business tax credits of 186 million for federal income tax purposes which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033 Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to prior ownership changes 87 The local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15 to certain eligible enterprises compared to the 25 statutory corporate income tax rate in China Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this beneficial income tax rate of 15 for 2019 through 2023 We constantly assess our intent to reinvest our offshore earnings As of December 31 2021 we no longer intend to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of our foreign entities that have been previously taxed in the US while for the remainder of our undistributed earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest We have recorded the taxes associated with the earnings we intend to repatriate in the future For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest no deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or state taxes have been recorded As of December 31 2021 such undistributed earnings were approximately 161 million The amount of any unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial Uncertain Tax Positions The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows in millions December 31 2018 253 Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions 39 Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 59 December 31 2019 273 Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions 66 Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 41 December 31 2020 380 Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions 117 Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions 90 Increases in balances related to current year tax positions 124 December 31 2021 531 As of December 31 2021 accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and were immaterial Unrecognized tax benefits of 473 million if recognized would not affect our effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance We file income tax returns in the US California and various state and foreign jurisdictions We are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2015 to 2018 Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2020 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes and 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination for California income tax purposes All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for US federal and California income tax purposes Our returns for 2008 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in other US state and foreign jurisdictions Given the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time 88 Note 15 Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the State University of New York the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York Under the lease and a related research and development agreement we are continuing to further develop the facility Under this agreement we are obligated to among other things meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo New York and spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10year period beginning April 30 2018 On an annual basis during the initial lease term as measured on each anniversary of such date if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements then we would be obligated to pay a 41 million program payment to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements Furthermore if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us then additional amounts may become payable by us As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a result of the COVID19 pandemic we were granted a deferral of our obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets through December 31 2021 in an amendment memorialized in August 2021 The amendment also extended our overall agreement to spend or incur 500 billion in combined capital operational expenses costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31 2029 As of December 31 2021 we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations following this expected deferral or in the years beyond However if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect we may incur additional expenses or be required to make substantial payments to the SUNY Foundation Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai China We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai Under the terms of the arrangement we are required to spend RMB 1408 billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023 and to generate RMB 223 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023 If we are unwilling or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project approvals in accordance with the Chinese governments standard

vigorously We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss if any associated with these claims On November 15 2021 JPMorgan Chase Bank JP Morgan filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014 In 2018 JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based upon Mr Musks August 7 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private Tesla disputed JP Morgans adjustment as a violation of the parties agreement In 2021 Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement which they duly accepted JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately 162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018 On January 24 2022 Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially unreasonable result Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially reasonable as required under the stock warrant agreements Litigation and Investigations Relating to

Finding and Mandatory Dispute Resolution following an investigation into undisclosed allegations of race discrimination and harassment at unspecified Tesla locations The DFEH gave notice that based upon the evidence collected it believes that it has grounds to file a civil complaint against Tesla Certain Investigations and Other Matters We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration the National Transportation Safety Board the SEC the Department of Justice DOJ and various state federal and international agencies We routinely cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests including subpoenas formal and informal requests and other investigations and inquiries 91 For example the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon Musks prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private The takeprivate investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment More recently on November 16 2021 the SEC issued a subpoena to us seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC settlement as amended On December 4 2019 the SEC issued a subpoena seeking information concerning certain financial data and contracts including Teslas regular financing arrangements On December 16 2021 the SEC informed us that it closed this investigation Separately the DOJ had also asked us to voluntarily provide it with information about the above matter related to taking Tesla private and Model 3 production rates We have not received any further requests from DOJ on these matters since we last provided information in May 2019 There have not been any additional developments in these matters that we deem to be material and to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred As is our normal practice we have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with government authorities We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business results of operation prospects cash flows and financial position We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business results of operations prospects cash flows financial position and brand Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from reductions in investment tax credits claimed under US federal laws for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a cosited solar power facility We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us for this obligation are not probable or material based on the facts known at the filing date We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation The amount of incentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size andor the amount of solar energy produced We also currently participate in one states

entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles In particular our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810 Consolidation We have considered the provisions within the agreements which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund net of agreed upon expenses estimated expenses tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements Generally our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investors interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements 92 Pursuant to management services maintenance and warranty arrangements we have been contracted to provide services to the funds such as operations and maintenance support accounting lease servicing and performance reporting In some instances we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements A funds creditors have no

obtained a binding market quote for a directors and officers liability insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit of 100 million Pursuant to the indemnification agreement our CEO provided from his personal funds directors and officers indemnity coverage to us during the interim term in the event such coverage is not indemnifiable by us up to a total of 100 million In return we paid our CEO a total of 3 million which represents the marketbased premium for the market quote described above as prorated for 90 days and further discounted by 50 Following the lapse of the 90day period we did not extend the term of the indemnification agreement with our CEO and instead bound a customary directors and officers liability insurance policy with thirdparty carriers In relation to our CEOs exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award Tesla withheld the appropriate amount of taxes However given the significant amounts involved our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 for additional taxes owed if any 93 Note 18 Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas We have two operating and reportable
